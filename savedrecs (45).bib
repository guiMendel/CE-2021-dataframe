Abstract = {{Novel synthetic analogue of immunomodulatory peptidoglycan monomer 1
   (PGM), (adamant-1-yl)-CH(2)CO-PGM (2), was prepared by acylation of
   epsilon-amino group of diaminopimelic acid with symmetrical
   (adamant-1-yl)-acetic acid anhydride in the presence of triethylamine.
   The product was isolated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25, followed by
   ion exchange chromatography on SP-Sephadex C-25. The susceptibility of
   (adamant-l-yi)-CH2CO-PGM to hydrolysis with N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine
   amidase was demonstrated, and the product of hydrolysis,
   (adamant-1-yl)-CH(2)CO-pentapeptide 3, was characterized. Both 2 and 3
   are water soluble and non-pyrogenic compounds. Immunomodulatory activity
   of PGM (adamant-1-yl)-CH(2)CO-PGM and structurally related derivative
   Boc-Tyr-PGM was compared in experiments in vivo, in mice, using
   ovalbumin (OVA) as an antigen. All three tested compounds exhibited
   comparable immunostimulating effects with respect to the induction of
   anti-ovalbumin immunoglobulin G. The results of evaluation of biological
   activity show that the substitution of free amino group in the parent
   peptidoglycan molecule with bulky lipophilic substituents did not affect
   the susceptibility to hydrolysis with N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidase
   and did not alter markedly the immunostimulating activity. The results
   also indicate that the free amino group in the peptide chain is not a
   necessary requirement in the mechanism of immunostimulation of tested
   immunomodulators. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present an algorithm for finding a nearest pair of points in two
   convex sets of Rn, and therefore, their distance. The algorithm is based
   on the fixed-point theory of nonexpansive operators on a Hilbert space.
   Its practical implementation requires a fast projection algorithm. We
   introduce such a procedure for convex polyhedra. This algorithm effects
   a local search in the faces using visibility as a guide for finding the
   global minimum. After studying the convergence of both algorithms, we
   detail computer experiments on polyhedra (projection and distance). In
   the case of distances, these experiments show a sublinear time
   complexity relative to the total number of vertices. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background. The use of cyclosporin (CsA) has improved graft survival in
   transplant (Tx) patients despite its potential nephrotoxicity. Children
   born to transplanted women may present with intrauterine growth
   retardation (IUGR). On the basis of potential reduced nephron mass both
   in IUGR and in newborn experimental animals exposed to CsA in utero, we
   investigated the renal function of children >1 year of age born to women
   under maintenance immunosuppression, including CsA.
   Methods. Fourteen children born to 12 Tx women (nine kidney, one
   pancreas-kidney, one heart, one liver) were investigated using inulin
   clearance (C-in), paraaminohippuric acid clearance (C-PAH),
   microalbuminuria, and electrolyte reabsorption rate.
   Results. Gestational age of the 14 infants was 34 +/- 3 weeks and birth
   weight 2018 +/- 620 g. During pregnancy, CsA trough blood level was 234
   +/- 115 mu g/l and plasma creatinine range was 96-136 mu mol/l. Two
   children were excluded from the study because renal investigation led to
   a diagnosis of hereditary nephritis (one Alport syndrome, one familial
   dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) that was retrospectively
   completed in the mother. Renal function tests were finally performed in
   12 children at 2.6 +/- 1.8 years of age: BP 94 +/- 7/55 +/- 5 mmHg, C-in
   117 +/- 28 ml/min/1.73 m(2), C-PAH 545 +/- 124 ml/min/1.73 m(2),
   filtration fraction 0.23 +/- 0.03, microalbuminuria 4.2 +/- 3.5mg/mmol.
   Electrolyte tubular reabsorption rates and urine concentrating capacity
   were normal.
   Conclusion. These results suggest that in children born to transplanted
   women taking CsA, renal function develops normally despite prolonged
   exposure in utero.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The management of infants and children with pulmonary
   atresia, ventricular septal defect, and multiple aorta pulmonary
   collateral arteries (PA/VSD/MAPCA) has proven to be challenging.
   Therapeutic approaches have included staged unifocalization, shunting,
   coiling of collateral vessels, and heart/lung transplantation. Results
   have been variable and frustrating. Hoping to take advantage of growth
   potential in pulmonary segments supplied by MAPCA, a more radical
   approach was adopted in March of 1997. This consists of single stage
   complete unifocalization with closure of the ventricular septal defect
   and establishment of right ventricular to pulmonary arterial continuity
   with a cryopreserved pulmonary allograft (Rastelli type correction)
   through a midline sternal incision. Methods: During an 18-month period,
   eleven consecutive infants with PA/VSD/MAPCA underwent complete surgical
   correction. The ages ranged from 5 days to 5 months. Weights ranged from
   2.2 to 5.6 kg. Through a standard median sternotony incision, the
   pericardium anti both pleural spaces were opened. Normothermic
   cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted. Section of all collaterals was
   accomplished without hypoxemia, and all collaterals were ligated at
   their origin from the aorta. They were then brought through posterior
   mediastinum to construct a pulmonary artery confluence. The ventricular
   septal defect was closed, and continuity was established between the
   right ventricle and the newly created pulmonary artery confluence with
   cryopreserved allografts. Results: Ten of 11 patients survived
   operation, with postoperative courses that were uncomplicated. Length of
   stay ranged from 7-16 days, with a median length of stay of 11 days. One
   perioperative death occurred in a patient with preoperative
   co-morbidities of necrotizing enterocolitis, with no functioning
   gastrointestinal tract, intraventricular hemorrhage, and ventilator
   dependency since birth. At angiography, this patient has no demonstrable
   central pulmonary arte ies and multiple diminutive aorta pulmonary
   collaterals. Autopsy revealed no demonstrable pulmonary arteries within
   the pulmonary parenchyma. All patients have been followed closely, and
   have grown normally. Two patients undergone repeat cardiac
   catheterization because of the echocardiographic demonstration of right
   ventricle pressures that had exceeded 50\% of systemic. Both patients
   were treated with balloon angioplasty and one of these patients has had
   stenting of stenotic pulmonary arterial segments. No other patients have
   required additional hospitalization. Right ventricular pressures have
   remained less than fifty percent of systemic by echocardiographic
   assessment in all other patients. Conclusions: We feel that a single
   stage correction of pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, and
   multiple aorta pulmonary collateral arteries can be accomplished in
   early infancy with acceptable morbidity and mortality. The initiation of
   normothermic cardio-pulmonary bypass greatly facilitates dissection of
   collaterals and prevents hypoxemia. Interventional cardiology with
   balloon angioplasty and stenting of abnormal pulmonary arterial segments
   is both an important essential adjunct in the management of these
   patients. We remain optimistic that a single stage approach to this
   complex lesion coupled with cardiac catheterization, balloon
   angioplasty, and stenting, will provide long-term results superior to
   staged approaches. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of unmodified (nat) and azide modified (mod) short organic
   polyethylene terephtalate (PET) and Nylon 66 (PA) fibers on the thermal
   behavior and dynamic mechanical properties of an isotactic polypropylene
   (iPP) has been investigated. The study has been carried out by means of
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis
   (DMA). The results have shown that both fibers behave as nucleant agents
   for the crystallization of polypropylene. A noticeable increase of the
   PP crystallization temperature in the presence of both fibers has been
   observed. This effect is more sensible with the incorporation of azide
   groups on the chemical structure of the fibers. On the other hand, the
   percentage of PP crystallinity (X-c) decreases in the presence of PET
   fibers and hardly varies with the incorporation of PA fibers. The fibers
   give rise to a sensible increase of the polypropylene stiffness (storage
   modulus), whereas a slight decrease of the damping factor (tan delta)
   has been observed. Furthermore, the PP glass transition temperature
   (T-g) decreases in the presence of the PET fibers and remains nearly
   unchanged with the incorporation of the PA fibers. The chemical
   modification of both fibers gives rise to an additional decrease of T-g
   as compared with the T-g of the plain PP. The activation energies for

Abstract = {{Microbiological and physicochemical aspects of spoiled specimens of
   dry-cured hams affected by deep putrefaction were studied. Total aerobe
   (10(3)-10(4) Cfu g(-1)), Micrococcaceae(10(4) cfu g(-1)) and lactic acid
   bacteria (< 10(2) cfu g(-1)) were present at the same levels as in
   unspoiled control hams. The overall hygienic qualify of the hams was
   good, even when spoiled. Only Enterobacteriaceae counts (10(2)-10(3) Cfu
   g(-1)) were higher in spoiled dry-cured hams. pH (5.85-6.09) and A(w)
   (0.888-0.909) were similar in spoiled and unspoiled hams. Thirty strains
   of the family Enterobacteriaceae were isolated and characterized. The
   strains were identified as Serratia liquefaciens and Proteus vulgaris.
   The strains of S. liquefaciens were slightly lipolytic, proteolytic, and
   psychrotrophic. Only two strains of this species were able to grow at an
   A(w) level of 0.949. The strains of P. vulgaris were not lipolytic, were
   strongly proteolytic and only slightly psychrotrophic, and were able to
   grow at an A(w) level of 0.949. None of them were able to grow at an
   A(w) level of 0.929. The results indicate that the isolated strains
   could have caused deep putrefaction of dry-cured hams, growing during
   the first non-refrigerated steps of the curing process before the
   decrease of A(w). Enterobacteriaceae ought therefore to be considered a
   microbial quality-related hazard in the development of HACCP systems for
   dry-cured ham. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The nasal septum is an important centre of endochondral ossification
   during the development of the facial region. Previous studies have shown
   that it is possible to recapitulate the differentiation programme of
   21-day-old rat nasal chondrocytes in vitro. The purpose now was to
   investigate, in vitro, the cell condensation phase that represents the
   earliest morphological event associated with cartilage differentiation
   in skeletal development. The study focuses on the ability of the cells
   to form condensations before overt differentiation, with special
   emphasis on gap-junction expression. The gap-junction protein connexin
   43 was localized by indirect immunofluorescence as primarily
   intracellular and, on day 5, at the condensation stage, as spot-like
   contacts between cells. Intracellular injection of the permeable dye
   Lucifer yellow led to the staining of up to 20 neighbouring cells,
   indicating functional gap junctions and coupling, In contrast, treatment
   of cultures with the gap-junction blocker glycyrrhetinic acid inhibited
   dye coupling and reduced cartilage differentiation. Northern blotting of
   connexin 43 mRNA showed a faint band during the first days of culture,
   with a striking increase after day 4. In addition, the mRNA of the
   homeodomain-containing gene Cart-1 began to be expressed in
   prechondrogenic condensations and corresponded to the expression of type
   II collagen mRNA. These data indicate that the early stage of in vitro
   chondrocyte differentiation is the formation of cell condensations and
   the ability to establish cell-to-cell communication. Connexin 43,
   together with other molecular mechanisms. mediates the condensation
   phase of chondrogenesis and sets up the optimal environment in which
   nasal septal cells may terminally differentiate into chondrocytes. (C)

Abstract = {{Two experiments examined the ability of an added stimulus to interfere
   with extinction of a target excitatory fear stimulus (a predictor of
   shock) in human autonomic conditioning. Both experiments demonstrated
   disruption of extinction when the added stimulus was inhibitory (a
   predictor of no shock, or safety signal). Subjects showed a return of
   fear when the target stimulus was tested alone, on both self-reported
   shock expectancy and skin conductance measures. The second experiment
   also demonstrated disruption of extinction when the added stimulus was
   excitatory. This result suggests that protection from extinction may
   occur even when the added stimulus is not inhibitory. Additional factors
   that may contribute to protection from extinction include
   context-specificity, occasion-setting and external inhibition. The
   results highlight the role that concurrent stimuli play in extinction,
   and emphasise the need to keep concurrent stimuli as similar as possible
   to the desired transfer context in practical applications of extinction
   such as exposure therapy for anxiety. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The transport phenomena for a viscous compressible oscillating how (with
   a zero mean velocity) in a tube subjected to a prescribed cycle-steady
   axial temperature gradient are analyzed. The governing equations are
   linearized under the conditions of high oscillating frequencies, small
   amplitudes, and in a tube with a high length-to-radius ratio. Based on a
   linearized theory, an analytical expression is obtained for the local
   friction factor, which depends on the prescribed cycle-steady axial
   temperature and independent of time. The local friction factor is shown
   to be a complex number indicating a phase shift between the
   cross-sectional averaged velocity and the local pressure gradient.
   Closed-form analytical expressions are also obtained for the temperature
   distribution and for the Nusselt number of solid/fluid interfacial heat
   transfer by solving the energy equations of the fluid and solid phases.
   The Nusselt number is also a complex number indicating a phase shift
   between the heat flux and the temperature difference between the wall
   and the oscillating fluid. The magnitude of the Nusselt number is also
   dependent on the prescribed axial cycle-steady temperature and
   independent of time, and is related to dimensionless thermal property
   parameters, dimensionless geometrical parameter, and dimensionless
   operation conditions parameters. To understand the momentum transport
   and energy transport characteristics, the radial distributions of axial
   velocity and temperature of the fluid are presented for different ratios
   of the Inner radius with respect to fluid's viscous penetration depth.
   Particular attention is given to the transport phenomena In the
   following two limiting cases: 1) a viscous compressible oscillating flow
   in a porous medium based on a capillary-tube model, and 2) a viscous
   compressible oscillating how in a resonant tube of a thermoacoustic
   refrigerator or in a pulse tube of a Stirling-type pulse-tube
   refrigerator.}},

Abstract = {{For rubber ring joints to resist plant root penetration in drier
   countries, it has been reported and promulgated into some national
   standards that a sufficiently high contact pressure between the rubber
   and the pipe must be maintained. The evaluation of the appropriate
   interfacial pressure to be used has been under discussion for some time
   and different values have been stated in different standards. This
   matter has been the subject of considerable controversy, and decisions
   on the interface pressure used will affect the performance and ease of
   insertion of a rubber ring joint. This paper reports and discusses
   previous and current research on root penetration past elastomeric
   joints, the existing test requirements of elastomeric pipe joints for
   resisting root penetration given in standards, and the inconsistencies
   in performance requirements across the different pipe material types.
   The initial interface sealing pressures for commonly used PVC, VC and
   FRC joints were assessed and these are discussed in light of the

Abstract = {{Infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) are thought by some
   investigators to play a central role in the neuropathogenesis of human
   immunodeficiency virus encephalitis (HIVE). It was recently proposed
   that these cells gain access to the central nervous system (CNS) through
   disruptions in blood-brain barrier (BBB) tight junctions, which occur in
   HIVE in association with accumulation of activated, HIV-1-infected,
   perivascular macrophages and serum protein extravasation (Am J Pathol
   1999, 155: 1915-27). The present study tested this hypothesis in basal
   ganglia tissue from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected
   macaques with encephalitis by examining vessels for immunohistochemical
   alterations in the tight junction-associated proteins, occludin and
   zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Compared to non-infected macaques and
   SIV-infected macaques without encephalitis, cerebral vessels from
   macaques with SIVE showed fragmentation and decreased immunoreactivity
   for both tight junction proteins. These alterations were associated with
   accumulation of perivascular macrophages and aberrant occludin and ZO-1
   immunoreactivity within these cells. In addition, perivascular
   extravasation of fibrinogen, a plasma protein, and a change from a
   strong linear staining pattern to a more irregular pattern of glucose
   transporter isoform-1 (GLUT-1), a metabolic BBB marker, were observed in
   regions with vascular tight junction protein alterations. These findings
   demonstrate that tight junction disruption occurs in SIVE in association
   with perivascular macrophage accumulation. While it cannot be
   ascertained from these studies whether such changes precede macrophage
   infiltration, or are secondary to the chronic presence of macrophages
   around cerebral vessels, disruptions in BBB integrity could serve as
   portals for additional accumulation of perivascular macrophages in SIVE.}},

Abstract = {{The iron stripping from di(-2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA)
   constitutes a problem in hydrometallurgical processes: whereas Fe(III)
   is easily extracted along with other elements such as zinc or cadmium,
   it is hard to strip it from the organic phase. It is well known that
   Fe(II) is readily stripped from D2EHPA, so a reduction of ferric to
   ferrous iron could be a way to solve this problem. In this work, the
   reductive stripping in vacuum of Fe(III) from D2EHPA has been studied by
   using SHG zinc powder as a reducing agent. The optimisation of operating
   conditions, such as degree of vacuum, acid concentration and quantity of
   added zinc, has been made. The experiments showed that a stripping yield
   greater than 89\% in only one stage can be achieved, depending on A/O
   ratio, at 80 kPa of pressure. The iron reduction and stripping have been
   done simultaneously. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. Ail rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This experimental study was initiated to determine whether
   TMLR may prevent porcine myocardium from ischemia and necrosis after
   acute myocardial infarction. In addition, the influence of TMLR on
   healthy myocardium was analyzed. Methods: The short-term effectiveness
   of TMLR was evaluated in 38 open-chest anesthetized pigs with (n = 18)
   or without (n = 20) acute LAD occlusion (observation period 6 hours):
   Six pigs served as controls (thoracotomy only). An additional six pigs
   had LAD occlusion only (ischemic group). A subsequent 12 pigs were
   treated by TMLR (CO2) prior to LAD occlusion: Six pigs received one
   laser channel/cm(2) (group 1)and in six pigs two channels/cm(2) in the
   LAD territory (group 2) were performed. In addition, 14 pigs underwent
   TMLR without ischemia: Seven pigs received 1 channel/cm(2) (group 3) and
   seven pigs 2 channels/cm(2) (group 4). Pathomorphological assessment and
   histology were performed. Results: TMLR limits the expansion of the
   myocardial infarction zone: laser group 2 demonstrated a significantly
   smaller area of necrosis in the area at risk (ischemic group (32\%) vs.
   laser group 1 (18\%, p = ns) and 2 (8\%, p = 0.0076); laser group 1 vs.
   2, p = 0.0056). The amount of the area of necrosis of laser groups 3
   (0.4\%) and 4 (0.04\%) compared to control (0\%) did not differ
   significantly (p = ns). Furthermore, in the lased territories of laser
   groups 3 and 3 microscopic analysis revealed signs of ischemia in 10 +/-
   30.9\% of all examined histolocical samples (p = ns vs. control). During
   a short coronary occlusion the laser-induced tracks were partially
   filled with blue dye in 94.8 +/- 27.0/85.9 +/- 34.3/94.85 +/-
   22.0\%/70.21 +/- 47.0\% (laser groups 1-4 respectively p = ns) The
   myocardial water content-measurements (MWC) of the ischemia and laser
   group 1 were not different at the end of the experiment (p = ns). In
   contrast, laser groups 2, 3 and 4 revealed significantly higher MWC
   values compared to control (p = 0.036, p < 0.001, p < 0.001;
   respectively). Conclusions: This prolonged acute study demonstrates that
   preventive CO2-laser revascularization significantly reduces the amount
   of necrosis in the area at risk. Histological examination supported the
   idea that some pigment gained access to the ischemic tissue via patent
   channels. In healthy myocardium, TMLR significantly increases myocardial
   water content and induces non-significant small ischemic and very small
   necrotic areas surrounding open laser channels.}},

Abstract = {{Strongly sigmoidal (S-shaped) dose-cancer incidence relationships are
   often observed in animal bioassays for carcinogenicity. Ifa genotoxic
   contribution is not plausible, an epigenetic mode of carcinogen action
   is proposed and a thresholded low dose - response suggested. In a strict
   sense, a threshold implies a no-yes situation, i.e., no effect up to the
   threshold dose and an effect above the threshold dose. A convincing
   explanation of the discontinuity of the gradient of the dose-response
   curve at the threshold dose is not available to me. However, the
   existence of a threshold is accepted for an individual. The threshold
   dose is the dose required for the manifestation of the tumor in an
   individual exactly at the end of a defined period of observation (for
   instance, 2 years in an animal bioassay, 75 years in humans), Because of
   genetic and lifestyle-dependent susceptibility differences, each animal
   or human has his individual threshold dose. For a group, no single
   threshold dose can be defined, irrespective of the mode of carcinogen
   action, Furthermore, in view of the stochastic elements in the process
   of carcinogenesis, the exact threshold dose can only be defined after
   tumor incidence and cannot be predicted.}},

Abstract = {{Lead (Pb) disks were exposed to a radon (Rn)-rich atmosphere and surface
   alpha particle emissions were detected over time. Cumulative Po-210
   alpha emission increased nearly linearly with time. Conversely,
   cumulative emission for each of Po-218 and Po-214 was constant after one
   and two hours, respectively. Processing of radiation-free Pb ore
   (galena) in inert atmospheres was compared with processing in ambient
   air. Galena processed within a flux heated in a graphite crucible while
   exposed to an inert atmosphere, resulted in lead contaminated with 210Po
   (Trial 1). A glove box was next used to prepare a baseline
   radiation-free flux sample in an alumina crucible that was heated in an
   oven with an inert atmosphere (Trials 2 and 3). Ambient air was
   thereafter introduced, in place of the inert atmosphere, to the
   radiation-free flux mixture during processing (Trial 4). Ambient air
   introduced Rn and its progeny (RAD) into the flux during processing so
   that the processed Pb contained Po isotopes. A typical coke used in lead
   smelting also emitted numerous alpha particles. We postulate that alpha
   particles from tin/lead solder bumps, a cause of computer chip memory
   soft errors, may originate fi om Rn and RAD in the ambient air and/or
   coke used as a reducing agent in the standard galena smelting procedure.}},

Abstract = {{The Arecibo incoherent scatter radar facility was operated on February
   26, 1998, and was used to observe the total solar eclipse that occurred
   over the Caribbean. A maximum of 87\% obscuration was observed over
   Arecibo at 1430 LT(1830 UT). The radar was operated using an
   experimental technique, which uses a 300 mu s single/multi- frequency
   pulse, to gather data from the altitude range 146-2412 km. The Sheffield
   University plasmasphere ionosphere model was used to interpret the
   measurements. The electron temperature was found to have decreased by
   600 K at 400 km altitude, but the magnitude of the decrease becomes
   smaller with increasing altitude. This is shown to be the result of the
   lesser degree of obscuration of the solar disk at latitudes north of
   Arecibo. Conjugate point photoelectron heating effects are also shown to
   play a significant role in the electron energy balance during the
   eclipse. The H+ ion temperature exhibited a response to the eclipse,
   with temperatures being around 200 K lower than expected at the time of
   maximum obscuration. There was relatively little variation observed in
   the O+ temperature. The response of the topside ionosphere is
   characterized by a downward motion arising from the contraction of the
   plasma due to reduced plasma temperatures. This is most clearly seen in
   the O+-H+ transition altitude which falls by 200 km. The transition
   altitude fully recovers within 2 hours after the eclipse. The location
   of the transition altitude acts to mitigate the effects of the eclipse
   on the topside electron densities.}},

Abstract = {{We present the circumstances surrounding a 57-year-old Caucasian man
   with advanced colorectal cancer who developed relapsing interstitial
   lung disease following a single exposure to irinotecan (CPT-11).
   Progressive pulmonary insufficiency and death were reported in the
   initial Japanese studies, despite institution of empiric steroid therapy
   for a syndrome similar to that which our patient experienced. As a
   result, patients with compromised pulmonary function were generally
   excluded from US clinical trials. Notwithstanding this, cough and
   dyspnea were reported in approximately 20\% of patients in the US
   studies. As the clinical indications for the use of this agent expand,
   we describe irinotecan-associated interstitial pneumonitis as a serious
   potential adverse effect. Patients with pre-existing pulmonary disease
   may be at higher risk for this complication and clinicians should be
   alert to this possibility. {[}(C) 2000 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins].}},

Abstract = {{One difficulty faced by students on many information management courses
   is the lack of any attempt to teach concepts of information. Therefore,
   if a core module does not fit in with a student's existing concept of
   information, it can make it hard for the student to recognise the
   relevance of that module. This paper addresses that problem by
   summarising concepts of information, and by presenting a simple model
   that attempts to unite the various concepts listed. The model is based
   on the idea that the meaning in a message depends on the context in
   which the message originated (the authorial context), and the context in
   which it is interpreted (the readership context). Characteristics of
   authors, readers and messages are discussed. The impact of the
   `knowledge' of `information' users, and of their community, is
   considered. Implications of the model are discussed. A definition of
   information is suggested, which attempts to encapsulate the nature of
   information implied by the model.}},

   For anal swabs direct plating on mCCDA was most efficient, with 100\% of
   samples positive, whilst for ileal contents enrichment in mCCD broth was
   best with 86\% of samples positive. Although only 34\% of ileal samples
   enriched in Preston broths were positive they yielded three species not
   isolated from mCCD broth, and hence indicated that some pigs were
   infected by at least two species of Campylobacter. Overall, the number
   of samples found to contain campylobacters, and the range of species
   isolated, was seen to be markedly affected by both the choice of
   selective medium and the isolation procedures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Purpose To investigate the time-wise reliability and efficiency of two
   new perimetric test algorithms, two computerised static threshold
   perimetry strategies, namely dynamic strategy (DS) and tendency oriented
   perimetry (TOP), were compared with the standard full-threshold strategy
   (normal strategy, NS).
   Methods We examined 41 eyes of 41 normal individuals without any ocular
   disease and 36 eyes of 36 glaucomatous patients, with the NS (4-to-2
   db), DS and TOP using an Octopus 1-2-3 perimeter. We analysed test time,
   stimulus time and the two global indices, mean sensitivity (MS) and loss
   variance (LV). Program 32X was used as test grid pattern.
   Results The mean test time for the NS was reduced by 52\% with the DS
   and by 78\% with the TOP strategy. Concerning the global indices, the MS
   value did not differ among the three strategies in the control or
   glaucoma group. However, the LV value was lower in the TOP strategy
   compared with the other two strategies in the glaucoma group. This
   suggested that the TOP strategy underestimated local glaucomatous visual
   field defects. The ability to detect early-stage glaucoma with the DS
   and TOP was inferior to that with the NS.
   Conclusions The DS was more efficient than the TOP strategy for the
   detection of early glaucomatous defects, whereas the TOP strategy
   required less testing time. The TOP strategy may be an appropriate
   approach for patients in whom time-consuming perimetry is not possible,
   or in whom the visual field defect is already advanced.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of turbulence on mixing in prototype reaction-diffusion
   systems is analyzed here in the special situation where the turbulence
   is modeled ideally with two separated scales consisting of a large-scale
   mean flow plus a small-scale spatiotemporal periodic how. In the limit
   of fast reaction and slow diffusion, it is rigorously proved that the
   turbulence does not contribute to the location of the mixing zone in the
   limit and that this mixing zone location is determined solely by
   advection of the large-scale velocity field. This surprising result
   contrasts strongly with earlier work of the authors that always yields a
   large-scale propagation speed enhanced by small-scale turbulence for
   propagating fronts. The mathematical reasons for these differences are
   pointed out. This main theorem rigorously justifies the limit
   equilibrium approximations utilized in non-premixed turbulent diffusion
   flames and condensation-evaporation modeling in cloud physics in the
   fast reaction limit. The subtle nature of this result is emphasized by
   explicit examples presented in the fast reaction and zero-diffusion
   limit with a nontrivial effect of turbulence on mixing in the limit. The
   situation with slow reaction and slow diffusion is also studied in the
   present work. Here the strong stirring by turbulence before significant
   reaction occurs necessarily leads to a homogenized limit with the strong
   mixing effects of turbulence expressed by a rigorous turbulent
   diffusivity modifying the reaction-diffusion equations. Physical
   examples from non-premixed turbulent combustion and cloud microphysics
   modeling are utilized throughout the paper to motivate and interpret the
   mathematical results. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the role of Moraxella catarrhalis complications in the setting
   of HIV disease, and to evaluate their occurence and outcome according to
   several epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory parameters, the
   clinical records of 2123 consecutive HIV-infected patients hospitalized
   in a 9-year period were retrospectively reviewed, and 4 cases of
   community-acquired M, catarrhalis pneumonia were identified. Three adult
   patients had a diagnosis of AIDS and severe concurrent immunodeficiency
   (with a CD4+ lymphocyte count below 60 cells/muL), while the fourth case
   involved a child with vertical HIV disease. Leukopenia and neutropenia
   were never present, but no patient received a potent antiretroviral
   regimen at the time of disease onset, A concurrent respiratory infection
   by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was
   recognized in 2 of 4 patients. Isolated M. catarrhalis strains were
   susceptible to all tested antimicrobial compounds (save ampicillin in 2
   cases), and appropriate antimicrobial treatment led to clinical and
   microbiological cure in all described episodes. Only 8 cases of
   HIV-associated Moraxella spp. disease have been reported to date in
   seven different literature reports (6 cases of pneumonia, and 1 of
   septicemia). According to our experience, M. catarrhalis may be
   responsible for appreciable morbidity among patients with advanced HIV
   infection, especially when a low CD4+ cell count or coexisting
   respiratory disease are present, Clinicians and microbiologists who care
   for HIV-infected patients should carefully consider the potential
   pathogenic role of Moraxella spp, organisms.}},

Abstract = {{The chronology of compressional deformation on Mars is determined using
   chrono-stratigraphic relations and crater counting in order to provide
   new evidences for the origin of this deformation. Chronological
   relations between compressional tectonic features with different
   directions establish that a single deformation phase occurred in each
   studied region. On other hand, the intersections between tectonic
   features and craters permit to compare the relative age of the
   deformation in different regions. The results demonstrate that there may
   be a long lapse of time between the accumulation of Hesperian volcanic
   plains and the compressional deformation in each region. The possible
   age deduced for the compressional deformation on both Hesperian ridged
   plains and Noachian primitive terrains is Late Hesperian. A single and
   global phase may explain the compressional deformation because it is
   restricted to a single epoch. A global contraction of the planet may
   explain many properties of compressional tectonism on Mars according to
   the thermal evolution of the planets. Such process does not exclude
   secondary sources of stress like Tharsis bulge that would control the
   geometry of structures at regional scales. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Intrusions are in general characterized by some noise or indications. In
   the network context these signals may be seen in the TCP-RESET packets

   Analysis of network traffic has shown that the profiles of such signals
   due to intrusion attempts are distinctly different from those due to
   routine operations and/or unintentional mistakes. By monitoring such
   suspicious signals in a distributed framework, intrusions or attempts
   thereof can be effectively detected. To track down attackers who may be
   using spoofed addresses, a new technique-based on traffic pattern
   monitoring is introduced. The traffic patterns can be traced across
   networks. For this purpose we have developed an SNMP-based messaging
   system which allows ``friendly{''} networks to collaborate in tracking
   down the intruder. Results using prototype implementations on a medium

Abstract = {{Plasmodiophora brassicae is an obligate biotroph that causes clubroot,
   one of the most damaging diseases of crucifers. Breeding of
   clubroot-resistant plants has been hampered by the large variation of
   pathogenicity in P. brassicae and by the lack of an efficient means for
   detecting specific isolates. To improve the practicality of P. brassicae
   pathotype-identification, a molecular approach was developed. RAPD
   profiles of 37 single-spore-derived isolates belonging to seven
   different pathotypes were compared. A RAPD marker, OPL14(1200), was
   found in the molecular pattern of all the isolates belonging to one
   particular pathotype (P1), pathogenic on all differential hosts tested.
   The DNA band corresponding to this marker was cloned and sequenced. No
   significant homology to previously characterised nucleotide sequences
   was found. Primers were designed to specifically amplify the OPL14(1200)
   band. The SCAR marker was observed in all isolates belonging to
   pathotype P1 and was absent in isolates belonging to other pathotypes
   and in the different plant hosts analysed. The SCAR marker was also
   generated from direct amplification of DNA from clubs (mixture of host
   and pathogen DNA) developed after infection by P1 isolates. This
   molecular marker may be a valuable tool for rapid and reliable
   identification of P. brassicae P1 isolates in areas where resistant
   varieties are cultivated.}},

   deepest in the Wolf-Rayet wind and thus least likely to be perturbed by
   a companion. These are accompanied by coherent variability in the
   profiles of lines with lower ionization/excitation potential and in the

   disappears from time to time, thus creating a puzzle yet to be solved.

Abstract = {{The concept of ``futility{''} and its determination in emergency
   medicine pose unique challenges to emergency physicians, patients, and
   society. The term ``futility,{''} although commonly used, is problematic
   in its scope, meaning, and interpretation. To bridge this gap in
   understanding, the authors suggest the construct of clinically
   nonbeneficial interventions (CNBI), instead of ``futility.{''} This
   language better informs discussions of nonbeneficial interventions
   across the risk spectrum of emergency medical practice, while retaining
   the focus on the patient's interests. Two cases are presented, which
   underscore the need for prudence and empathetic communication when
   addressing issues of CNBI. Determinations of expected benefit should be
   based on established scientific evidence, and the goals and values of
   patients, not on individual biases regarding quality of life or other
   subjective matters. While physicians are under no ethical obligation to
   provide treatments that they judge have mo realistic likelihood of
   clinical benefit, the context in which these determinations take place
   is of critical importance. When certain interventions are appropriately
   withheld, concerted efforts should be made to maintain effective
   communication, comfort, support, and counseling for patients, friends,
   and families. In all aspects of clinical decision making, the value of
   various interventions and therapies must be based on expected risks and
   benefits to the patients, first and foremost.}},

   experiment, white clover was subjected to shading cast from three
   different grass species. There were differences in both the quantity and
   quality of light received under the various grass canopies. The canopies
   reduced overall growth and branching of clones, while increasing the
   length of and biomass allocation to petioles. Lolium perenne L. canopy
   shade had different effects compared to Holcus lanatus L, or Dactylis
   glomerata L., but between the latter two species, no differences were
   detected. In the second experiment, light reflected from grass
   neighbours was provided simultaneously with direct light There was a
   strong increase in FR and a resulting decrease in the R:FR due to
   neighbouring D. glomerata, but few consistent effects on white clover
   growth and morphology; there was evidence of phototropic movement by the
   leaves. We show that plants must experience partial shading, and not
   just reflected light, in order to alter their morphology in response to
   the presence of different species of grass neighbours.}},

Title = {{Nicorandil - An updated review of its use in ischaemic heart disease
   with emphasis on its cardioprotective effects}},
Journal = {{DRUGS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{955-974}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Nicorandil is a drug with both nitrate-like and ATP-sensitive
   potassium-channel (K(+)ATP) activating properties. By virtue of this
   dual mechanism of action, the drug acts as a balanced coronary and
   peripheral vasodilator and reduces both preload and afterload,
   The K(+)ATP channel has been shown to be involved in the phenomenon of
   myocardial preconditioning, and studies in animal models of
   ischaemia-reperfusion-induced myocardial stunning or infarction indicate
   that nicorandil has cardioprotective effects. Studies in patients
   undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) have
   shown that the administration of nicorandil reduces ST-segment elevation
   during ischaemia.
   Nicorandil significantly improved the results of exercise tolerance
   tests versus baseline in patients with stable effort angina pectoris in
   early noncomparative trials. The drug also improved the results of
   exercise tolerance tests relative to placebo in early randomised,
   double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.
   In randomised, double-blind comparative studies in patients with angina
   pectoris, nicorandil has demonstrated equivalent efficacy, as measured
   by exercise tolerance testing, to isosorbide di- and mononitrate,
   metoprolol, propranolol, atenolol, diltiazem, amlodipine and nifedipine,
   The effects of nicorandil on various aspects of myocardial recovery from
   ischaemic damage caused by acute myocardial infarction have been
   investigated in the short term. Regional left ventricular (LV) wall
   motion, a marker of myocardial function, was significantly improved in
   nicorandil recipients relative to control.
   The main adverse event associated with nicorandil as treatment for
   angina pectoris is headache. This can be minimised by commencing
   nicorandil at a low dose in patients prone to headache. There have been
   infrequent case reports of mouth ulcers in patients receiving
   nicorandil; causality has not been conclusively established, but product
   prescribing information indicates that an alternative treatment should
   be considered if persistent aphthous or severe mouth ulceration occurs.
   Thus, nicorandil remains a useful background therapy for patients with
   angina pectoris, The drug has also demonstrated potential
   cardioprotective effects when used as part of an intervention strategy
   directly after acute myocardial infarction in high-risk patients.
   Further large scale longer term studies of nicorandil in this latter
   indication are awaited with interest.}},

Abstract = {{We address the problem of dynamic surface tension using measurements of
   sheet diameters that results from the impact of a liquid jet of diameter
   d(o) on a small disk of diameter d(i) (d(i)/d(o) similar or equal to 4),
   At low velocities, the sheet diameter D is related to d(o) by the Weber
   number We, constructed with the liquid density rho, the jet velocity
   u(o), and the surface tension sigma at the rim: D/d(o) = 1/8 We = 1/8
   {[}rho u(o)(2)/(sigma/d(o))]. This relation expresses the equilibrium
   between inertial forces and surface tension forces at the sheet rim.
   When a surfactant has been dissolved in the bulk of the liquid prior to
   the formation of the initial jet, the rim surface tension, and therefore
   the sheet diameter, depends on the amount of surfactant adsorbed at the
   rim, This amount is fixed by a competition between surface formation
   induced by radial extension and repopulation of the liquid interface in
   surfactant, The experimental setup proposed here provides a method to
   measure dynamic surface tension from sheet diameter measurements and
   symmetrically to monitor the adsorption of a surfactant on a liquid
   surface. The available adsorption time ranges from 10 to 100 ms.
   Experimental data obtained with two surfactants are in agreement with a
   model of a diffusion-controlled adsorption at the interface, (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The IL-6 receptor complex is expressed in different polarized epithelial
   cells such as liver hepatocytes and intestinal cells. It consists of two
   subunits: gp80, which binds the ligand, and gp130, which is responsible
   for signal transduction. In stably transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney
   (MDCK) cells we have studied the localization of the human IL-6 receptor
   subunits and found that gp80 and gp130 are predominantly expressed at
   the basolateral membrane. Analysis of MDCK cells expressing truncated
   forms of gp80 or gp130 showed that loss of the cytoplasmic domains
   results in apical delivery. Expression of deletion mutants of gp80 in
   MDCK cells led to the identification of two discontinous motifs
   responsible for basolateral sorting: a membrane-proximal tyrosine-based
   motif (YSLG) and a more membrane-distal dileucine-type motif (LI).
   Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3
   (STAT-3) only occurred via basolaterally located gp80, suggesting that
   endogenous gp130 is also constrained to the basolateral plasma membrane.
   Our identification of a basolateral sorting signal within the
   cytoplasmic region of gp80 for the first time attributes a function to
   this domain.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes the spatial distribution and trophic structure of
   the polychaetes inhabiting the soft-bottoms of Alfacs Bay, a
   semi-enclosed, shallow-water area (Ebro Delta, north-western
   Mediterranean). The hydrographic regime is basically marine, with a
   combination of seawater renewal and continental runoff causing permanent
   stratification. The Bay was affected by anthropogenic activities (viz.
   influx of irrigation waters, large-scale aquaculture, and periodical
   dredging at the mouth). 41 samples were taken during summer (July 1987
   and September 1992). 101 polychaete species were identified, with an
   average density and biomass of 6370 (650-23700) ind..m(-2) and 7.52
   (0.87-66) DW g.m(-2) respectively. Nine assemblages were identified:
   shelf (stressed, confined, typical), boundary deep central basin (inner,
   typical, seaward) and marine (typical, navigation channel). The trophic
   structure was dominated by deposit-feeding polychaetes (mainly
   Pseudomastus deltaicus, Heteromastus filiformis, Notomastus latericeus,
   Mastobranchus trinchesii, Euclymene oerstedii, Clymenura clypeata,
   Streblospio shrubsolii, Monticellina heterochaeta and Ampharete
   acutifrons). An increase in the ecological weight of carnivorous
   polychaetes (mostly Lumbrineris latreilli) from the shelf towards the
   marine assemblages was also noticed. The analysis of die polychaete
   taxocoenosis provides key items to understand the functioning of the
   semi-enclosed, shallow-water system under study.}},

Abstract = {{Activation of the ms oncogene is an important step in carcinogenesis.
   Human MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells were transformed with a
   point-mutated form of the Ha-ms oncogene, Epidermal growth factor
   receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation levels were chronically elevated after
   EGF induction and the EGFR ligand-driven internalization rate was slower
   in Ha-res transformed MCF-10A cells, Additionally, basal levels of
   p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression and enzyme
   activity were significantly higher in Ha-res transformed cells,
   localized predominantly in the nucleus. The anti-EGFR monoclonal
   antibody (MAb) 225 and the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD153035
   blocked anchorage-independent growth of Ha-ms transformed cells in soft
   agar and were more effective when used in combination, The MEK inhibitor
   PD98059 and anti-erbB-2 MAb L26 also suppressed colony formation of
   Ha-res transformed cells in soft agar, Therefore, Ha-ms transformation
   leads to an augmentation in signaling through the EGFR as a result of an
   increase in ligand-dependent phosphorylation, a decrease in its
   internalization and an up-regulation in basal p44/42 MAPK levels. These
   effects may contribute to uncontrolled growth of Ha-ms-transformed human
   mammary epithelial cells. Published 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.(dagger)}},

Abstract = {{The diagnosis of nerve entrapment at osteofibrous tunnels relies
   primarily on clinical and electrodiagnostic findings. Recently, the
   refinement of high-frequency broadband transducers with a range of 5-15
   MHz, sophisticated focusing in the near field, and sensitive color and
   power Doppler technology have improved the ability to evaluate
   peripheral nerve entrapment in osteofibrous tunnels with ultrasonography
   (US). In the upper limb, osteofibrous tunnels amenable to US examination
   include the carpal tunnel for the median nerve and the cubital and Guyon
   tunnels for the ulnar nerve. In the lower limb, these tunnels include
   the fibular neck for the common peroneal nerve, the tarsal tunnel for
   the posterior tibial nerve, and the intermetatarsal spaces for the
   interdigital nerves. High-resolution US allows direct imaging of the
   involved nerves, as well as documentation of changes in nerve shape and
   echotexture that occur in compressive syndromes. A spectrum of extrinsic
   causes of entrapment, such as tenosynovitis, ganglia, soft-tissue
   tumors, bone and joint abnormalities, and anomalous muscles, can also be
   diagnosed with US. With continued experience, it is likely that this
   technique will be increasingly used to evaluate nerve entrapment
   syndromes.}},

   years, in particular, E-mail and the World Wide Web. While they conduct
   web searches, most are not health information seekers on the web.
   However, they have positive attitudes toward the delivery of health
   information on the Internet. Participants viewed the WHM website
   prototype in a computer laboratory. They then completed several search
   tasks and a questionnaire, and discussed their perceptions of the
   website in a moderated focus group setting. They found the text-based
   content on the WHM website interesting, easy to understand, and useful.
   However, they experienced difficulty navigating the website using the
   website's navigational elements-hypertext links and search engine. They
   wanted to see more graphical elements added to the website, as well as
   communications channels, such as newsgroups, listserves and chatrooms,
   provided they are moderated by health care practitioners. They were not
   favorably disposed toward advertising on health websites.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Coronary artery bypass grafting on the beating heart causes
   significant hemodynamic compromise during displacement of the heart. The
   precise mechanisms causing altered hemodynamics have not been clearly
   understood. The purpose of this study was to define the hemodynamic
   changes caused by displacing the heart in patients undergoing beating
   heart surgical procedures.
   Methods. Forty-four patients (35 men, 9 women; mean age, 64.5 +/- 9.6
   years) underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. The
   hemodynamic variables were collected before and after positioning the
   heart for anastomosis of the left anterior descending, circumflex, and
   posterior descending coronary arteries.
   Results. There was a significant increase in right ventricular
   end-diastolic pressure during positioning for all vessels, and in left
   ventricular end-diastolic pressure during positioning for the left
   anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries. Positioning for
   the circumflex artery showed the largest increase of left and right
   ventricular end-diastolic pressure, resulting in the greatest
   hemodynamic compromise.
   Conclusions. In the clinical setting of diseased human hearts, there is
   a biventricular contribution to altered hemodynamics. The increase of
   right ventricular end-diastolic pressure in all positions suggests that
   the major cause of hemodynamic changes is disturbed diastolic filling of
   the right ventricle, especially by direct ventricular compression. (C)

Abstract = {{Aster kantocensis Kitam., an endangered plant species of the family
   Compositae, is a local endemic to the gravelly floodplains of a few
   rivers in central Japan. The successful growth of A. kantoensis is
   mainly restricted to sparsely vegetated sites where, due to lack of
   continuous vegetation, high radiant energy input results in stressful
   conditions with excessive light and heat. To reveal the ecophysiological
   characteristics which enable the species to cope with such environmental
   stresses, we measured leaf temperature, shoot architecture and
   photosynthetic and transpirational responses together with the
   microclimate of the natural habitat. Even under sunny summer conditions,
   the leaf temperature of A. kantoensis was much lower (35-39 degrees C)
   than the soil surface temperature (max. 60 degrees C). The relationship
   between leaf position (height from the ground) and leaf temperature
   showed that the caulescent rosette form of A. kantoensis helps avoid
   leaf overheating. Moreover, in situ gas exchange measurements revealed
   that the high transpirational capacity (as high as 10 mmol H2O m(-1)
   s(-1)) was effective in controlling leaf temperature. as long as the
   soil water supply was not severely limited. Since it has effective
   mechanisms to avoid the multiple stresses indigenous to its gravelly
   floodplain habitat, A. kantoensis can maintain a high photosynthetic
   rate (up to 30 mu mol CO2 m(-1) s(-1)) without any midday depression
   under sunny summer conditions. (C) 2000 Annals of Botany Company.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, Rhodotorula glutinis was reported to produce a large amount
   of exocellular mannan, having a repeating unit of
   -->3)-D-Manp-(1-->4)-D-Manp-(1-->. Recently, we Pound that antigenic
   polysaccharides of Leptospira biflexa serovar patoc strain Patoc I have
   the same repeating unit and cross-react with antisera raised against
   extended strains of other leptospires (K. Matsuo, E. Isogai, and Y.
   Araki, Carbohydr. Res., in press). This structural identity and the
   difficulty of producing and isolating antigens led us to confirm the
   usefulness of Rhodotorula mannan as an immunoreactive antigen in a
   serological diagnosis of leptospirosis, In the present investigation, we
   confirmed the structural identity of an exocellular mannan isolated from
   R. glutinis AHU 3479 and tried to nse it as an immunoreactive antigen in
   a serological diagnosis of leptospirosis, From its chemical analysis and
   H-1- and C-13-labeled nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, the
   Rhodotorula mannan was confirmed to consist of the same disaccharide
   units. Furthermore, such a preparation was shown to immunoreact to
   various sera from patients suffering with leptospirosis as well as to
   most rabbit antiserum preparations obtained from immunization with
   various strains of pathogenic leptospires, Therefore, the Rhodotorula
   mannan preparation is useful as an immunoreactive antigen in the

Title = {{Hydrogen control in steel weld metal by means of fluoride additions in

Abstract = {{Development of high-strength steels in recent years has required the
   weld metal to also improve in terms of mechanical properties. However,
   strengthening the weld metal tends to increase susceptibility to
   hydrogen-assisted cracking (HAC); therefore, diffusible hydrogen content
   in the weld metal, attributed to be a major cause of HAC, must be
   drastically reduced. Flux ingredients containing fluoride ions (F.(1))
   such as fluorspar (CaF2) have been reported to reduce diffusible
   hydrogen content in steel welds. It is believed fluoride reacts with
   hydrogen in the are atmosphere to form HF, which is removed from the
   molten iron because of its low solubility.
   Preliminary thermodynamic calculations considering the reaction between
   hydrogen in the are atmosphere and the fluoride in the slag were
   performed and predict that KF, MnF3 and K3AlF6 are more effective in
   reducing hydrogen than CaF2, which is a common flux ingredient. To
   verify their predicted effectiveness, experimental FCAW consumables with
   additions of these fluorides were designed and fabricated at the
   Colorado School of Mines (CSM). Welds were produced using these
   electrodes and the amounts of diffusible hydrogen were measured. The
   experiments proved the effectiveness of fluoride additions as predicted
   by the thermodynamic calculations. For example, reductions of 39-67\%,
   21-34\% and 22-31\% in diffusible hydrogen were achieved with the
   additions of 7.4 wt-\% of KF, 4.8 wt-\% of MnF3 and 5.5 weight percent
   of K3AlF6, respectively, in comparison with the experimental results
   with those of the base electrode (with only CaF2).}},

Abstract = {{We report a case of 14-year-old male patient with osteoid osteoma of the

   dumbbell-shaped paravertebral tumor in the region of the exiting left C6
   nerve. A computed tomographic (CT) scan after myelography showed a much
   smaller bony defect in the medial aspect of the left C6 pedicle with
   central calcification and extensive bone sclerosis around the defect,
   typical of osteoid osteoma. The diagnosis was confirmed postoperatively.
   The resected specimen exhibited extensive vascularization of the osteoid
   tissue. The case is presented because MRI did not allow a specific
   diagnosis of osteoid osteoma, and suggested the tumor was larger than in
   reality it was, by also depicting the reactive inflammation around the
   tumor as if it were part of the tumor.}},

Abstract = {{Human early hematopoietic progenitors from bone marrow (BM) and
   leukapheresis products (LP) are highly proliferative in presence of
   accessory cells in standard culture on the murine FBMD-1 cell feeder
   with weekly addition of human interleukin-3 (HuIL-3) and
   granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (HuG-CSF). If however purified
   CD34(+) cells are cultured under otherwise identical conditions,
   cobblestone areas (CAFC) formed by the same number of target cells are
   diminished by more than 1 log, as we showed previously. This suggests
   that mature cells are involved in growth of early progenitors. To
   determine whether this bystander effect is mediated by soluble growth
   factors, or by direct cell-to-cell contact with early progenitors, we
   stimulated mature plastic adherent cells separately and tested the
   resulting conditioned supernatant (ACS) on CAFC and colony-forming
   unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) production. In ACS-complemented
   standard cultures of purified CD34(+) cells, the yield of CAFC was up to
   1 log higher if compared to parallel cultures without ACS. Likewise, the
   CFU-GM production was enhanced in presence of ACS, especially in the
   adherent fraction of the culture. When CD34(+) cell cultures were
   performed with ACS but without added interleukin-3 (IL-3) and
   granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), CAFC production was in
   the same range as if these growth factors were added alone. Addition of
   anti-G-CSF antibody (Ab) to ACS decreased CAFC recruitment
   significantly, whereas anti-IL-3 Ab had no significant effect. These
   findings suggest that ACS complemented with IL-3 and G-CSF replaces the
   accessory cells largely; this is not only due to presence of G-CSF,
   because ACS in combination with recombinant growth factors mounts CAFC
   yield higher than saturating amounts of growth factors alone do. There
   must be further synergizing soluble factors in the supernatant.}},

Title = {{Isolated resection of segment 8 for liver tumors - A new approach for
   anatomical segmentectomy}},
Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF SURGERY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1224-1229}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Hypothesis: Isolated resection of segment 8 (the right anterosuperior
   liver segment) is one of the most difficult hepatectomies to perform
   because of the location of segment 8, the relation between section 8 and
   the main intrahepatic vessels, and the absence of any anatomical
   landmarks. The few reports that deal with isolated resection of section
   8 generally describe the use of a deep wedge transparenchymal
   transection.
   Design: Original surgical technique.
   patients and Methods: The proposed technique is based on the
   extraparenchymal isolation and temporary clamping of the right anterior
   artery and portal branches, causing ischemic demarcation on the liver
   surface, which corresponds to the anatomical borders of the right
   paramedian segments (5 and 8). The liver is widely transected along the
   main hepatic fissure; then the pedicles of segment 8 are selectively
   ligated inside the parenchyma, and the resection is accomplished. This
   technique was used in 10 patients: 5 with hepatocellular carcinoma on
   cirrhosis and 5 with liver metastases.
   Results: The mean operation time was 253 minutes. Intraoperative blued
   loss was minimal in all cases, and 7 patients did not require blood
   transfusion. Slight complications developed in 3 patients, and there was
   no operative death. The mean hospital stay was 9.3 days.
   Conclusions: This operative procedure is safe and ensures a complete
   anatomical resection of segment 8. The wide opening of the liver
   parenchyma facilitates hemostasis and makes it possible to obtain a
   correct resection margin. This technique is recommended for limited
   metastatic lesions located in segment 8 or for hepatocellular carcinoma
   arising in a cirrhotic liver.}},

   antigen, and infected cells presented the antigen in the contest of
   major histocompatibility complex class I. Inoculation of mice with
   recombinant YF virus elicited SIINFEKL-specific CD8(+) lymphocytes and
   induced protective immunity against challenge with lethal doses of
   malignant melanoma cells expressing ovalbumin. Furthermore, active

Abstract = {{Syntectonic fluids have been sampled through fluid inclusion
   microthermometry and crush-leach analyses (cations and halogens) from a
   50 km N-S transect through the central-southern Pyrenees. The fluid
   inclusions are contained in syntectonic quartz veins in Triassic
   redbeds, Cretaceous carbonates and Hercynian basement rocks, with some
   calcite and dolomite data from limestones and evaporites in more
   external parts of the belt. The main datasets come from (1) Alpine shear
   zones cutting the Neouvielle granodiorite in the Hercynian Axial Zone at
   the north end of the transect; (2) An imbricate zone beneath the Alpine
   Gavarnie Thrust at the Pic de Port Vieux; (3) Several localities in the
   footwall and hangingwall of the Gavarnie Thrust on the southern margin
   of the Axial Zone.
   The inclusion fluids generally decrease in salinity from 27-35\% at the
   northern end of the transect to 7-22\% on the southern margin of the
   Axial Zone. The majority of the inclusions have Cl/Br ratios lower than
   seawater and are interpreted as relict fluids after seawater evaporation
   and halite precipitation in the upper Trias. This interpretation is
   supported by Cl-Br-Na systematics, which are consistent with a change
   from halite to halite + sylvite precipitation with progressive
   evaporation. Fluids in the basement shear zones are interpreted to have
   essentially the same evaporitic origin as those still contained in
   sedimentary formations, although it is possible that final concentration
   of brines in the Neouvielle Massif involved retrograde hydration
   reactions with removal of water by precipitation of hydrous minerals.
   The fluids are also very similar in salinity and halogen chemistry to
   those found in veins associated with Mesozoic Pb-Zn-F deposits which
   predate the thrusting. The lower salinities seen at the southern margin
   of the Axial Zone are interpreted to reflect mixing of the brines with a
   higher level fluid (connate or meteoric water) circulating within the
   Mesozoic carbonates of the higher thrust sheets. At one locality where
   Triassic evaporites are still present, high Cl/Br ratios at relatively
   low salinities are present in inclusions within the underlying Triassic
   redbeds, but low Cl/Br ratios at higher salinities are seen lower in the
   sequence. This is consistent with dissolution of halite by a dilute
   fluid, but with limited penetration downwards.
   We suggest that the fluid history of the Pyrenees evolved through a
   series of stages: (1) Upper Triassic evaporite formation with sinking of
   brines into underlying redbeds and fractured basement rocks; (2)
   Circulation of brines with formation of Pb-Zn deposits along faults at
   some time between the Triassic and the Upper Cretaceous; (3) Renewed
   extension with erosion of Triassic rocks in many areas and further
   drawing down of Triassic brines into the basement; (4) Deposition of U.
   Cretaceous and Palaeocene carbonates containing connate waters of marine
   origin: (5) Formation of the Pyrenean thrust belt with overpressuring
   and expulsion of the brines along shear zones and faults; (6) Creation
   of topography with a high-level circulation system in the Mesozoic
   thrust sheets driven largely by topography. At the southern margin of
   the Axial Zone there was limited mixing of the deeper, overpressured
   brines with these more dilute, hydrostatically pressured fluids. An
   important point is that because of their density, hypersaline brines are
   difficult to expel from the upper crust, and may be involved in a
   succession of alteration and mineralisation events in the same general
   area over hundreds of millions of years. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A systematic review of the methods used to assess appropriateness of
   acute bed use and the evidence on the scale of inappropriate use in
   different patient groups is presented. Issues of generalisability of the
   findings are also addressed. Criteria based tools are the accepted way
   of measuring inappropriate days of stay and admissions, although opinion
   based classification is very common. While a number of tools exist, few
   have been adequately tested for reliability and validity. The
   Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (AEP) is the most commonly used
   tool, and has been tested more widely. It appears to be both reliable
   and valid. An estimated 29\% of admissions to acute psychiatric may be
   inappropriate. Regarding days of care after. admission, between 24 and
   58\% of stays were not judged to be appropriate for continued stay on an
   acute ward. The need for continued acute psychiatric care may become
   lower as patients experience continued stay in the acute setting. A lack
   of housing and community support was the most commonly cited reason
   preventing discharge. Rates of inappropriate use appear to be higher for
   older patients than For the general population. Wide variation in rates
   of inappropriate days of stay was found, but it may be safe to assume
   that inappropriate use is greater than 20\% across a wide variety of
   settings. Reasons for older patients to remain in an acute hospital bed
   after medically necessary are typically model ate nursing care needs
   (i.e. long-term care). The estimates of inappropriate use in other
   groups was Found to be highly variable. Before definitive conclusions on
   the inappropriate use of acute beds can be made, future research needs
   to take into account the methodological problems discussed here. (C) 253

Abstract = {{1. According to previous field studies in the biomanipulated Bautzen
   reservoir (Germany), a midsummer decline of the dominating zooplankter,
   Daphnia galeata, was suggested to be initiated by a simultaneous
   occurrence of low fecundity of the daphnids and a selective feeding of
   underyearling fish on mature daphnids. The timing of both processes was
   assumed to be triggered by spring water temperature. However, the field
   data were not appropriate for testing whether yearly differences in
   spring warming are strong enough to control the predation rate of
   underyearling fish on daphnids.
   2. By combining field data on fish growth, feeding and population
   mortality, the daily uptake of Daphnia by a virtual population of
   underyearling perch (Perca fluviatilis) was simulated, in addition, the
   daily predatory mortality of mature daphnids was calculated
   independently. Scenarios with a warm and a cold spring were compared.
   Furthermore, the delayed warming of a pelagic zone of a lake versus a
   littoral one was simulated. Sensitivity of the simulation to changes in
   five parameters was tested.
   3. In both the warm spring scenario and the littoral warming scenario,
   more daphnids in general and more mature daphnids in particular were
   eaten, compared with the cold spring and pelagic scenarios. The
   predatory mortality of mature daphnids was driven by the increasing gape
   size of growing fish such that in warmer years the fish reach earlier
   the size at which they can eat mature daphnids.
   4. The simulation was most sensitive to changes in daily mortality rate
   of the fish and to the size at maturity of the daphnids. Since at least
   the fish mortality is also temperature-dependent via the growth rates of
   fish, the predation rate of perch on D. galeata in Bautzen reservoir is
   substantially increased during a warm spring. This underlines the
   assumption that even a slight global warming may have a decisive
   influence on food web processes due to the fine-scaled patterns of
   trophic interactions in lakes.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of 10 peptides structurally related to the growth hormone
   (GH) releasing peptide hexarelin, injected into the paraventricular
   nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), on penile erection was studied in
   male rats. Six out of the 10 peptides tested induced penile erection in
   a dose-dependent manner. Among them, the most potent were EP 80661, EP
   60761 and EP 91072, which were active at doses of 20-200 ng. The potency
   of these peptides in inducing penile erection is comparable to that of
   apomorphine, oxytocin and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid similarly injected
   into the PVN. Other peptides found active were EP 50885, EP 90101 and EP
   91071, which induced penile erection at doses of zoo - 2000 ng. In
   contrast, EP 51322, EP 70555, EP 51216 and EP 91073 were inactive, as
   were hexarelin, EP 40904 and EP 40737 in a previous study. The majority
   of EP peptides found active when injected into the PVN induced penile
   erection, although to a lesser extent, also when given systemically
   (endovenously). The proerectile effect of EP peptides was prevented by
   the oxytocin receptor antagonist {[}d(CH2)(5)
   Tyr(Me)(2)-Orn(8)]-vasotocin given into the lateral ventricles but not
   into the PVN, by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor
   N-G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester given either into the lateral
   ventricles or into the PVN, by the N-type Ca2+ channel blocker omega
   -conotoxin GVIA and by morphine, but not by the dopamine receptor
   antagonist cis-flupenthixol or by the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor
   antagonist dizolcipine, given into the PVN. As the structure - activity
   relationship of EP peptides for proerectile activity is different from
   those of other biological actions of these compounds, ie for GH release
   and eating behaviour, the present results suggest that EP peptides
   induce penile erection by acting on specific hypothalamic receptor sites
   that activate paraventricular oxytocinergic neurons projecting to
   extrahypothalamic brain areas that mediate this sexual function by a
   mechanism similar to that of dopamine receptor agonists, oxytocin and
   N-methyl-D-aspartic acid.}},

   allergic rhinitis, Their effectiveness as an anti-inflammatory adjunct
   in the treatment of acute recurrent sinusitis has not been adequately
   established in a controlled clinical study.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that
   intranasal corticosteroid treatment produces additional relief in the
   treatment of acute sinusitis with oral antibiotics.
   Methods: Patients who were 12 years old and older with a history of
   recurrent sinusitis were treated while experiencing a new episode of
   acute sinusitis, which was diagnosed by symptoms and confirmed by
   computed tomography scan of the paranasal sinuses. Patients were treated
   for 21 days with amoxicillin clavulanate potassium and randomized to
   receive concurrent mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS; Nasonex {[}400
   mug, twice daily]; n = 200 patients) or placebo spray (twice daily: n =
   207 patients). Symptom scores for headache, facial pain, congestion,
   purulent rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, and cough were recorded at baseline
   and throughout treatment. Results: Baseline symptom scores showed a
   moderate level of symptom severity comparable in both groups.
   Patient-recorded twice daily symptom scores showed that adjunctive
   treatment with MFNS caused a significantly greater decrease in total
   symptom score (primary efficacy variable) and in individual scores of
   inflammatory symptoms associated with the obstruction process (headache,
   congestion, and facial pain) compared with placebo. Symptoms associated
   with the secretory processes were improved to a lesser degree.
   Therapy-related local adverse events were not significantly different
   between groups.
   Conclusion: The addition of intranasal corticosteroid, MFNS 400 mug
   twice daily, to antibiotics significantly reduces symptoms of acute
   sinusitis compared with antibiotic treatment alone.}},

Abstract = {{Lesion and brain-imaging studies have implicated the prefrontal and
   parietal cortices in arithmetic processing, but do not exclude the
   possibility that these brain areas are also involved in nonarithmetic
   operations. In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to explore which brain areas contribute uniquely to numeric
   computation. Task difficulty was manipulated in a factorial design by
   varying the number of operands and the rate of stimulus presentation.
   Both manipulations increased the number of operations to be performed in
   unit time. manipulating the number of operands allowed us to investigate
   the specific effect of calculation, while manipulating the rate of
   presentation allowed us to increase task difficulty independent of
   calculation. We found quantitative changes in activation patterns in the
   prefrontal and parietal cortices as well as the recruitment of
   additional brain regions, including the caudate and midcerebellar
   cortex, with increasing task difficulty. More importantly, the main
   effect of arithmetic complexity was observed in the left and right
   angular gyrus, while the main effect of rate of stimulus presentation
   was observed in the left insular/orbitofrontal cortex. Our findings
   indicate a dissociation in prefrontal and parietal cortex function
   during arithmetic processing and further provide the first evidence for
   a specific role for the angular gyrus in arithmetic computation
   independent of other processing demands. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the expression of the genes involved in the
   synthesis and degradation of arginine is modulated by multiple specific
   and pleiotropic factors, acting as repressors or activators as a
   function of the availability of amino acids, of nitrogen source, and the
   presence or absence of arginine. Four proteins (Arg80, Arg81, Mcm1 and
   Arg82) coordinate the expression of arginine metabolic genes, by
   repressing the biosynthetic genes and by inducing the catabolic genes,
   in response to arginine. Arg80, Arg81 and Mcm1 form a complex
   interacting with DNA sequences called >>arginine boxes<< present in the
   promoters of arginine co-regulated genes. Binding of arginine to Arg81
   allows the interaction of the complex with DNA. The role of Arg82 is to
   stabilize the Mcm1 and Arg80 proteins. The synthesis of one of the
   subunits of carbamoylphosphate synthetase encoded by CPA1 gene is also
   repressed by arginine. However, this results from a translational
   control involving a 25 amino acid peptide encoded by the messenger of
   CPA1. Expression of the catabolic genes CAR1 and CAR2 is repressed, as
   long as exogenous nitrogen is available, by the regulatory complex
   Ume6-Sin3-Rpd3 exhibiting histone deacetylase activity. Expression of
   CAR1 but not of CAR2 is activated by Gln3 and Nil1 when cells are grown
   on poor nitrogen sources.}},

Abstract = {{We present 4 cases of uterine mesenchymal tumors that were located
   mostly in the myometrium in middle-aged women. Grossly the tumors
   vaguely resembled conventional leiomyomas. All tumors were extremely
   hyalinized. The tumor cells were remarkable because of their large size
   and epithelioid shape. They occurred singly or more often in variously
   sized clusters with pericellular clear spaces looking like a halo. The
   extracellular matrix often formed lacunae around the neoplastic cells.
   The lacunar type of growth was somewhat reminiscent of immature
   cartilage. In some places the cells lined up in vague cord-like
   structures. The epithelioid cells often grew within vessel walls and
   subendothelially, simulating angioinvasion. In 2 cases there were
   periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive, needle-shaped crystalloids in the
   cytoplasm of the tumor cells. No atypias and no mitoses were found in
   any of the 4 rumors. Mucicarmine slain was negative in all casts.
   Immunohistochemically the tumor cells were negative for cytokeratins,
   synaptophysin, chromogranin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), S-100
   protein, and inhibin. They were instead strongly positive for smooth
   muscle actin, desmin and HMB-45. All patients are disease free after a
   1-4-year follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Braithwaite's (1989) theory of reintegrative shaming has been
   increasingly used to explain how social control efforts may result in
   both conformity and deviance. Using this theory as an interpretive
   framework, this study examines the relative effectiveness of a
   specialized drug court in reducing recidivism risks. Contrary to
   expectations based on its structural similarity to the principles of
   reintegrative shaming the authors find that risks of recidivism for drug
   court participants are significantly higher than comparable offenders
   processed outside drug court. Field observations and a more detailed
   examination of daily practices explain these unexpected findings by
   revealing that the drug court is actually more stigmatizing than
   conventional courts and is not reintegrative enough in its orientation
   toward punishment. The results of this study are then discussed in terms

Abstract = {{A human strain of influenza virus (A, H1N1) was shown to bind in an
   unexpected way to leukocyte and other gangliosides when compared with
   avian virus (A, H4N6) as assayed on TLC plates. The human strain bound
   only to species with about 10 or more sugars, white the avian strain
   bound to a wide range of gangliosides including the 5-sugar
   gangliosides, By use of specific tectins, antibodies, and FAB and
   MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry an attempt was done to preliminary identify
   the sequences of leukocyte gangliosides recognized by the human strain.
   The virus binding pattern did not follow binding by VIM-2 monoclonal
   antibody and was not identical with binding by anti-siaiyl Lewis x
   antibody, There was no binding by the virus of linear NeuAc alpha3- or
   NeuAc alpha6-containing gangliosides with up to seven monosaccharides
   per mol of ceramide, Active species were minor NeuAc alpha6-containing
   molecules with probably repeated HexHexNAc units and fucose branches.
   This investigation demonstrates marked distinctions in the recognition
   of gangliosides between avian and human influenza viruses. Our data
   emphasize the importance of structural factors associated with more
   distant parts of the binding epitope and the complexity of carbohydrate
   recognition by human influenza viruses.}},

Abstract = {{Surface sediments from 95 lakes provide information on the spatial
   variation of modern pollen spectra in Oregon and southern Washington.
   Percentages for 13 pollen types were compared within and between
   vegetation zones to characterize regional patterns of pollen spectra.
   The percentage data were also compared with climate variables to
   determine relationships between pollen percentages and regional climate
   gradients. The composition of modern pollen spectra corresponds well
   with the distribution of the pollen producers. Most pollen assemblages
   were generally dominated by Pinus, but those west of the Cascade Range
   were dominated by Alnus. Low percentages of Pseudotsuga/Larix, Tsuga
   mertensiana, Abies, and Picea pollen coincided with local occurrence of
   the trees. The distributions of the pollen data were arranged along
   gradients of temperature and effective moisture. West of the Cascade
   Range, Alnus, Tsuga heterophylla, Pseudotsuga/Larix, and Cupressaceae
   pollen were abundant and correlate well with moderate temperature and
   high effective moisture. In the shrub-steppe and woodlands east of the
   Cascade Range, where effective moisture is low, Artemisia, Cupressaceae,
   and Pinus pollen were dominant. At high elevations, Pinus, T.
   mertensiana, Abies, and Picea were common pollen types in areas with
   short growing seasons and high effective moisture. Pollen percentages
   collected from lake surface sediments, moss polsters, and soils were
   compared within a number of vegetation types to assess their similarity.
   The three types of sample yielded similar results for forested areas,
   but lake sediment samples from upper- and lower-treeline sites captured
   a more regional picture of the vegetation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

   deposits an close to the Pacific coast. Ag-Au and base metal ore bodies
   are generally located along the eastern border of the Guerrero Terrane.
   Copper deposits are present between these two zones. Important precious

Abstract = {{Salivary nitrite arises from nitrate and is the main source of gastric
   nitrite, a precursor of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds. We examined
   nitrate and nitrite levels in unstimulated saliva from subjects
   consuming low-nitrate low-vitamin C diets. When saliva was collected
   from six men at nine times of the day (Experiment 1), night time nitrite
   levels were significantly higher than day time values and nitrite varied
   more than nitrate, When saliva was collected from 29 subjects aged 19-37
   or 60-84 years at four times of the day during 1991-1993 (Experiment 2),
   all older subjects and older men had significantly higher nitrite levels
   than the corresponding younger subjects, night time nitrite levels in
   men were significantly raised, and nitrate and nitrite levels in the
   same samples were closely correlated. Saliva was collected at 6.00 a.m.
   on two successive days in 1997 from 16 subjects who had collected saliva
   in 1991-1993 (Experiment 3). Nitrate and nitrite levels on day 1 of
   experiment 3 were closely correlated with those on day 2. Nitrate and
   nitrite levels on days 1 and 2 of Experiment 3 were correlated with the
   corresponding parameters in Experiment 2 with P = 0.04 and 0.08 for day
   1, and 0.10 and 0.28 for day 2, respectively. Hence, saliva nitrite
   levels rose at night and were higher in older people, especially older
   men, and saliva nitrate and nitrite levels varied little from day to
   day, but varied more after 4-6 years. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams \&

Journal = {{GUT}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{481-486}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background-Leptin is an important regulator of food intake and energy
   expenditure. Initially it was thought to be expressed exclusively in and
   secreted by adipocytcs. Recently, leptin expression was also noted in
   other tissues, including rat gastric mucosa. Information on leptin and
   leptin receptor expression in the human stomach is lacking.
   Aim-To investigate expression of leptin and its corresponding receptors
   in human gastric epithelial cells.
   Methods- Fundic and antral gastric mucosal biopsies, primary cultures of
   human gastric epithelial cells, and the human gastric cancer cell line
   AGS were screened for expression of leptin and different leptin receptor
   isoform mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
   Immunohistochemistry was performed for localisation of leptin and leptin
   receptor proteins in gastric mucosa.
   Results-mRNA of leptin and its four receptor isoforms (huOB-R, long
   receptor isoform; huB219.1-3, short receptor isoforms) was detected in
   gastric mucosal biopsies, cultured human gastric epithelial cells, and
   gastric cancer cells. Immune-histochemistry demonstrated that chief as
   well as parietal cells were reactive to leptin and leptin receptors.
   Conclusions-Leptin and leptin receptors are expressed in human gastric
   mucosa. These findings suggest a paracrine and/or autocrine effect of
   leptin on gastric epithelial cell function.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an optimal design scheme for photonic transport
   networks that interconnect multiple wavelength division multiplexing
   (WDM) self-healing ring systems by using optical cross connects (OXCs).
   To calculate the number of OXCs required in each hub to interconnect
   these ring systems, a virtual mesh network is generated, on which the
   route of each optical path (OP) going through multiple adjacent rings
   ({''}ring{''} is defined as circle in network topology) is determined
   based on a list of hubs. An integer-programming-based design problem is
   then formulated that minimizes the overall cost of facilities including
   OXCs as well as ring systems to accommodate a given demand. By solving
   this problem, we can simultaneously optimize required number of ring
   systems in each ring, wavelength assignment within each individual
   bidirectional ring system, required number of OXCs in each hub, and
   capacity to be allocated to each OF. Numerical examples show that the
   ring-based network is more cost-effective than the mesh restorable
   network when the cost of an OADM is lower than that of an OXC, and the
   OXC-to-fiber cost-coefficient ratio is sufficiently large.}},

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{333-338}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Short-bowel syndrome is a state of severe malabsorption
   resulting from absence or removal of the small bowel for several causes.
   A number of short-bower patients develop hyperphagia. Leptin, a protein
   secreted from adipose tissue, signals the amount of energy stores to the
   brain. Objective: To study body composition and leptin regulation in
   short-bowel patients and to determine whether or not leptin
   concentrations are linked with hyperphagia. Design: We studied 25
   short-bower patients (remnant bowel less than 150 cm) and 31 controls
   and 10 oral nutrition. Fifteen patients received total parenteral
   nutrition and 10 oral nutrition. Anthropometric measurements, body
   composition (by bioelectrical impedance), and cholesterol,
   triacylglycerol and leptin concentrations were studied in all subjects.
   Results: There were no differences between short-bowel patients and
   controls in anthropometric variables, body composition, or leptin
   concentrations. Leptin concentrations were higher in short-bovvel women
   than men (9.21 +/-8.54 vs. 3.22+/-1.86 ng/ml, P=0.01). Leptin
   concentrations correlated positively with age (r=0.4, P=0.045), body
   mass index (r=0.52, P=0.007), fat mass (r=0.67, P=0.001) and body fat
   (r=0.68, P=0.0001); there were no correlations with other body
   composition parameters. We found no correlations between parenteral or
   oral nutrition and body composition parameters, or between leptin
   concentrations and the presence of hyperphagia. Logistic regression
   analysis showed that body fat correctly identified leptin concentrations
   in 60\% of patients. Conclusions: Body composition, leptin
   concentrations and leptin regulation in patients with short-bowel
   syndrome are similar to those of controls. Leptin concentrations do not
   correlate with hyperphagia in short bowel-patients. (C) 2000 Harcourt

   measurements and the individual classification of a patient is based on
   a normal reference range. Unfortunately, not all the manufacturers

   densitometer, we measured BMD of the lumbar spine and the femur of 4400
   healthy women aged (25-80) years and we calculated the corresponding T-
   and Z-scores. Multiple regression analysis was applied to examine the
   dependence of BMD on age and weight. Greek data was compared with
   American and Italian. Results: There was a statistically significant
   difference between Greek and American mean values of all age groups. The
   Italian normal range is closer to our data and can be reliably used at
   least as T-scores are concerned. Still, there is a small discrepancy in
   Z-scores, which might influence patient management. Conclusion: We

Abstract = {{In order to determine the environmental occurrence of both varieties of
   Cryptococcus neoformans in the city of Sao Paulo, pigeon droppings and
   vegetable material from trees of the genus Eucalyptus were collected at
   typically crowded places. A total of 38 sites downtown where large heaps
   of pigeon droppings could be found were selected for sampling. Pigeon
   droppings from 10 (26.3\%) of these sites were positive for C.
   neoformans var. neoformans in at least one sample. Twelve eucalyptus
   woods located within four municipal parks were also surveyed; vegetable
   material from Eucalyptus spp. trees were collected monthly over a 2-year
   period. C. neoformans var. gattii was recovered from a wood in
   Ibirapuera Park during the same season on two different occasions
   (November 1996 and November 1997); this park contained specimens of
   Eucalyptus camaldulensis, a natural habitat of C. n. var. gattii. C. n.
   var. neoformans was detected in a wood in Ibirapuera Park and Aclimacao
   Park. The results show that both C. n. var, neoformans and C. n, var.
   gattii are present in the urban environment of Sao Paulo city at sites

Abstract = {{Histone N-terminal tails are central to the processes that modulate
   nucleosome structure and function. We have studied the contribution of
   core histone tails to the structure of a single nucleosome and to a
   histone (H3-H4)(2) tetrameric particle assembled on a topologically
   constrained DNA minicircle. The effect of histone tail cleavage and
   histone tail acetylation on the structure of the nucleoprotein particle
   was investigated by analyzing the DNA topoisomer equilibrium after
   relaxation of DNA torsional stress by topoisomerase I. Removal of the H3
   and H4 N-terminal tails, as well as their acetylation, provoked a
   dramatic change in the linking-number difference of the (H3-H4)(2)
   tetrameric particle, with a release of up to 70\% of the negative
   supercoiling previously constrained by this structure. The (H3-H4),
   tetramers containing tailless or hyperacetylated histones showed a
   striking preference for relaxed DNA over negatively supercoiled DNA.
   This argues in favor of a change in tetramer structure that constrains
   less DNA and adopts a relaxed flat conformation instead of its
   left-handed conformation within the nucleosome. In contrast neither
   removal or hyperacetylation of H3 and H4 tails nor removal or
   hyperacetylation of H2A and H2B N-terminal tails affected the nucleosome
   structure. This indicates that the globular domain of H2A and H2B is
   sufficient to stabilize the tailless or the hyperacetylated (H3-H4)(2)
   tetramer in a left-handed superhelix conformation. These results suggest
   that the effect of histone tail acetylation that facilitates
   transcription may be mediated via transient formation of an (H3-H4)(2)
   tetrameric particle that could adopt an open structure only when H3
   and/or H4 tails are hyperacetylated.}},

Abstract = {{Exercise training produces a vast array of physiological adaptations,
   ranging from changes in metabolism to muscle mitochondrial biogenesis.
   Researchers studying the physiological effects of exercise often use
   animal models that employ forced exercise regimens that include aversive
   motivation, which could activate the stress response. This study
   examined the effect of forced treadmill running (8 wk) on several
   physiological systems that are sensitive to training and stress. Forced
   treadmill running produced both positive and negative physiological
   adaptations. Indicative of positive training adaptations, exercised male
   Sprague-Dawley rats had a decrease in body weight gain and an increase
   in muscle citrate synthase activity compared with sedentary controls. In
   contrast, treadmill running also resulted in the potentially negative
   adaptations of adrenal hypertrophy, thymic involution, decreased serum
   corticosteroid binding globulin, elevated lymphocyte nitrite
   concentrations, suppressed lymphocyte proliferation, and suppressed
   antigen-specific IgM. Such alterations in neuroendocrine tissues and
   immune responses are commonly associated with chronic stress. Thus
   treadmill running produces both positive training adaptations and
   potentially negative adaptations that are indicative of chronic stress.
   Researchers employing forced activity need to be aware that this type of
   exercise procedure also produces physiological adaptations indicative of
   chronic stress and that these changes could potentially impact other
   measures of interest.}},

Abstract = {{We have performed EPR and DC magnetization measurements on single
   crystals of La1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7. Similar to previous authors, we found an
   increase in the magnetization, M, near 300 K, a temperature well above
   T-C similar to 125 K. Previously, this high temperature( similar to 300
   K) feature has been suggested to be intrinsic to the system. We have
   observed at these high temperatures the appearance of new ferromagnetic
   resonances, FMR. Within the experimental error the volume of sample
   required to explain the extra M and the intensity of the FMR is the
   same. We conclude that the increase in M and the FMR are due to the
   presence of extrinsic Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phases and not to intrinsic
   effects as has been claimed. Furthermore, the resonance field of the EPR
   line due to the La1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7 phase presents a measurable
   temperature-dependent anisotropy up to similar to 450 K. The anisotropy
   is proportional to M, independent of the extrinsic RP phase content, and
   intrinsic to the system. We show that demagnetization effects can
   explain only part of the anisotropy. The role of short-range magnetic
   ordering in the observed intrinsic features cannot be disregarded,
   however. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The de electrical conductivity of glasses in the system V2O5-Sb-TeO2

   indicated n-type semiconductors from the measurement of thermoelectric
   power. The de conductivities at 473 K for the present glasses were
   determined to be 6.38 x 10(-6)-7.13 x 10(-3) S cm (-1), indicating that
   the conductivity increased with increasing V2O5 concentration. Sb

   vanadium-tellurite glasses. From the conductivity-temperature relation,
   it was found that small polaron hopping model was applicable at the
   temperature above 1/2 Theta(D) (Theta(D) : the Debye temperature); the
   electrical conduction at T > 1/2 Theta(D) was due to adiabatic small
   polaron hopping of electrons between vanadium ions for V2O5 greater than
   or equal to 50 mol\%, and non-adiabatic for 30 less than or equal to
   V2O5 < 50 mol\%. The polaron bandwidth ranged from 0.052 to 0.148 eV in
   the adiabatic region, and the value was < 0.030 eV in the non-adiabatic
   region. The hopping carrier mobility varied from 2.65 x 10(-6) to 2.90 x
   10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 473 K. The carrier density was obtained to be
   of the order of 10(20-)10(21) cm(-3), and temperature dependence of the
   carrier density was barely present between 423 and 473 K. The
   conductivity of the present glasses was primarily determined by hopping
   carrier mobility. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The goals of the present study were to develop a predictive
   coronary risk scoring system after intravenous gamma -globulin (IVGG)
   therapy of any dose for the different preparations currently used in the
   treatment of children with Kawasaki disease and to determine the
   predictive value of the system. The previously reported scoring systems
   were based on treatment with high-dose IVGG therapy at limited doses and
   were determined using investigative methods.
   Methods: Four hundred and fifty-one patients were randomized into one of
   three groups and received either i.v. polyethylene glycol-treated human
   immunoglobulin at a dose of either 200 (n=147) or 400 mg/kg per day
   (n=152) or freeze-dried sulfonated human immunoglobulin at 200 mg/kg per
   day (n=152) for 5 consecutive days. We documented 31 cases of coronary
   abnormalities (CA). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was
   performed using 49 clinical variables and the resulting predictive model
   was validated.
   Results: The duration of fever (odds (1 day)/odds (greater than or equal
   to 5 days)=0.158; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.0385-0.648),
   hemoglobin (odds (Q1=10.3)/odds (Q3=11.6) = 3.97; 95\% CI 1.92-8.20),
   IgG (odds (Q1=1900)/odds (Q3=2658)=2.72, 95\% CI 1.18-6.25) and IgA
   (odds (Q1=72)/odds (Q3=160) =0.415; 95\% CI 0.253-0.680) levels after
   completion of gamma -globulin infusion were independent predictors. The
   model is quasi-cross validated and has acceptable sensitivity and
   selectivity. The estimated risk and observed occurence of CA coincide.
   Conclusions: Determinants of the risk of CA after IVGG therapy are a
   longer duration of fever, a lower IgG level, a higher IgA level and a
   lower hemoglobin level after IVGG infusion. This model is applicable for
   IVGG doses from 1 to 2 g/kg and for at least two different gamma
   -globulin preparations.}},

Abstract = {{Substitution by cysteine of one of the heme iron axial ligands (His66)
   of flavocytochrome b(2) (L-lactate:cytochrome c oxidoreductase from
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has resulted in an enzyme (H66C-b(2)) which
   remains a competent L-lactate dehydrogenase (k(cat) 272+/-6 s(-1),
   L-lactate KM 0.60+/-0.06 mM, 25 degreesC, I 0.10, Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) but
   which has no cytochrome c reductase activity. As a result of the
   mutation, the reduction potential of the heme was found to be -265+/-5
   mV, over 240 mV more negative than that of the wild-type enzyme, and
   therefore unable to be reduced by L-lactate, Surface-enhanced resonance
   Raman spectroscopy indicates similarities between the heme of H66C-b2
   and those of cytochromes P450, with a v(4) band at 1345 cm(-1) which is
   indicative of cysteine heme-iron ligation. In addition, EPR spectroscopy
   yields g-values at 2.33, 2.22 and 1.94, typical of low-spin ferric
   cytochromes P450, optical spectra show features between 600 and 900 nm
   which are characteristic of sulfur coordination of the heme iron, and
   MCD spectroscopy shows a blue-shifted NIR CT band relative to the
   wild-type, implying that the H66C-b(2) heme is P450-like, Interestingly,
   EPR evidence also suggests that the second histidine heme-iron ligand
   (His43) is displaced in the mutant enzyme.}},

   first inoculated with Aa in the log phase of its growth cycle, After 48
   h, we counted the adhered cells. We measured the dissolution of HA
   coating due to bacterial exposure alone by determining the calcium and
   phosphate concentrations in the bacterial growth media. Once the
   adherent bacteria were removed from these rods, we subjected them to 5
   million cycles of fatigue testing after immersion in Lactated Ringer's
   solution. We then determined the calcium and phosphate concentrations in
   the fatigue media. We found additional coating loss after fatiguing of
   the samples. This coating loss was a cumulative effect of bacterial
   exposure and fatigue loading of the hydroxyapatite-coated dental implant
   alloy, The lower crystallinity sample showed a higher loss of coating
   within the range of crystallinity studied here, The HA coating in
   implants during clinical use may undergo such changes, because they are

Abstract = {{The structural transformation of dioctahedral 2:1 layer silicates
   (illite, montmorillonite, glauconite, and celadonite) during a
   dehydoxylation-rehydroxylation process has been studied by X-ray
   diffraction, thermal analysis. and infrared spectroscopy. The layers of
   the samples differ in the distribution of the octahedral cations over
   the cis- and trans-sites as determined by the analysis of the positions
   and intensities of the 11l, 02l reflections, and that of the relative
   displacements of adjacent layers along the a axis (c cos beta /a), as
   well as by dehydroxylation-temperature values. One illite, glauconite,
   and celadonite consist of trans-vacant (tv) layers; Wyoming
   montmorillonite is composed of cis-vacant (cv) layers, whereas in the
   other illite sample tv and cv layers are interstratified. The results
   obtained show that the rehydroxylated Al-rich minerals (montmorillonite,
   illites) consist of tv layers whatever the distribution of octahedral
   cations over cis- and trans-sites in the original structure. The reason
   for this is that in the dehydroxylated state, both tv and cv layers are
   transformed into the same layer structure where the former trans-sites
   are vacant.
   The dehydroxylation of glauconite and celadonite is accompanied by a
   migration of the octahedral cations from former cis-octahedra to empty
   trans-sites. The structural transformation of these minerals during
   rehydroxylation depends probably on their cation composition. The
   rehydroxylation of celadonite preserves the octahedral-cation
   distribution formed after dehydroxylation. Therefore, most 2:1 layers of
   celadonite that rehydroxylate (similar to 75\%) have cis-vacant
   octahedra and, only in a minor part of the layers, a reverse cation
   migration from former trans-sites to empty octahedra occurred. In
   contrast, for a glauconite sample with a high content in Al-IV and Al-VI
   the rehydroxylation is accompanied by the reverse cation migration and

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. TO determine the efficacy of photochemical keratodesmos (PKD)
   for closing surgical incisions in the cornea of enucleated rabbit eyes
   compared with that achieved using sutures and self-sealing incisions.
   METHODS. A 3.5-mm incision, at an angle parallel to the iris, was made
   in the cornea of enucleated New Zealand White rabbit eyes. The
   intraocular pressure required to cause leakage (IOPL) from the untreated
   incision was then recorded. Photochemical keratodesmos treatment was
   then performed by application of a dye, Rose Bengal (RB), in saline
   solution to the surfaces of the incision wound, followed by laser
   irradiation at 514 nm from an argon ion laser. Immediately after
   treatment, the IOPL was measured. Both dose and laser irradiance
   dependencies were studied in five or more eyes for each condition and
   appropriate control eyes. The IOP(L)s were compared with those obtained
   using conventional interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures. Other dyes were
   tested in a similar fashion.
   RESULTS. The IOPL of 300 mm Hg was obtained using a fluence of 1270
   J/cm(2) with an irradiance of 1.27 W/cm(2) (laser exposure time, 16
   minutes 40 seconds). No sealing was observed using dye or light alone
   where control pressures of approximately 30 mm Hg were found. At higher
   dose (1524 J/cm(2)) and irradiance (3.82 W/cm(2); 6 minutes 35 seconds),
   PKD was less effective, which may be attributable to thermal effects.
   PKD produced IOP(L)s similar to those in closure by sutures. Other dyes
   such as riboflavin-5-phosphate and N-hydroxy-pyridine thione also
   produced efficient bonding after PKD. Nonphotochemically active dyes did
   not produce significant increases in the IOPL at which leakage occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS. The increase in IOPL after PKD treatment, comparable with
   that with sutures, in enucleated rabbit eyes demonstrates the
   feasibility of this technique ex vivo.}},

Abstract = {{We compared general, epidural, and spinal anesthesia for outpatient knee
   arthroscopy (excluding anterior cruciate ligament repairs). Forty-eight
   patients (PISA physical status I-III) were randomized to receive either
   propofol-nitrous oxide general anesthesia with a laryngeal mask airway
   with anesthetic depth titrated to a bispectral index level of 40-60,
   15-20 mL of 3\% 2-chloroprocaine epidural, or 75 mg of subarachnoid
   procaine with 20 mu g fentanyl. All patients were premedicated with
   <0.035 mg/kg midazolam and <1 mu g/kg fentanyl and received
   intraarticular bupivacaine and 15-30 mg of IV ketorolac during the
   procedure. Recovery times, operating room turnover times, and patient
   satisfaction were recorded by an observer using an objective scale for
   recovery assessment and a verbal rating scale for satisfaction.
   Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance and chi(2).
   Postanesthesia care unit discharge times for the general and epidural
   groups were similar (general = 104 +/- 31 min, epidural = 92 +/- 18
   min), whereas the spinal group had a longer recovery time (146 +/- 52
   min) (P = 0.0003). Patient satisfaction was equally good in all three
   groups (P = 0.34). Room turnover times did not differ among groups (P =
   0.16). There were no anesthetic failures or serious adverse events in
   any group. Pruritus was more frequent in the spinal group (7 of 16
   required treatment) than in the general or epidural groups (no pruritus)
   (P < 0.001). We conclude that epidural anesthesia with 2-chloroprocaine
   provides comparable recovery and discharge times to general anesthesia
   provided with propofol and nitrous oxide. Spinal anesthesia with
   procaine and fentanyl is an effective alternative and is associated with
   a longer discharge time and increased side effects.}},

   show that for both atomic components Manning's theory (where both types
   of correlation factors are automatically equal) gives reasonable
   agreement with Monte Carlo data only when the tracer diffusion
   coefficients are within a factor of two. On the other hand, the theory
   of Moleko ct nl. gives excellent agreement for both correlation factors
   over a very wide range of diffusion coefficient ratios. To demonstrate
   some of these differences the formalisms of Manning and Moleko ct al.

Abstract = {{1 The quantitative importance of prostaglandin H synthase
   (PGHS)-mediated cooxidation of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) was
   evaluated in human liver microsomes (n=17) in relation to CYP-dependent
   ATRA 4-hydroxylation.
   2 Observed rates of ATRA cooxidation (4.6-20 pmol mg protein(-1)
   min(-1)) and 4-hydroxylation (8.7-45 pmol mg protein(-1) min(-1)) were
   quantitatively similar and exhibited similar individual variation (4 and
   5 fold, respectively).
   3 From kinetic studies cooxidation was an efficient process in human
   hepatic microsomes (V-max K-m(-1)=0.25) compared with NADPH- and
   NADH-mediated 4-hydroxylation by CYP (V-max K-m(-1)=0.14 and 0.02,
   respectively).
   4 The capacity of lipid hydroperoxide metabolites of arachidonic acid to
   mediate ATRA oxidation was established directly, but downstream products
   (D, E, F and I-series prostaglandins) were inactive.
   5 cDNA-expressed CYPs supported ATRA oxidation by lipid hydroperoxides.
   Whereas CYPs 2C8, 2C9 and 3A4, but not CYPs 1A2 or 2E1, were effective
   catalysts of the NADPH-mediated reaction, cooxidation supported by
   15(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid was mediated by all five CYPs.
   The cooxidation reaction in human hepatic microsomes was inhibited by
   the CYP inhibitor miconazole.
   6 These findings indicate that ATRA oxidation is quantitatively
   significant in human liver. Lipid hydroperoxides generated by
   intracellular enzymes such as prostaglandin synthase and lipoxygenases
   are sources of activated oxygen for CYP-mediated deactivation of ATRA to
   polar products.}},

Abstract = {{California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) and northern fur seals
   (Callorhinus ursinus) are each believed to host distinct hookworm
   species (Uncinaria spp.). However, a recent morphometric analysis
   suggested that a single species parasitizes multiple pinniped hosts, and
   that the observed differences are host-induced. To explore the
   systematics of these hookworms and test these competing hypotheses, we
   obtained nucleotide sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA (D2/D3 28S,
   D18/D19 28S, and internal transcribed spacer {[}ITS] regions) from 20
   individual hookworms parasitizing California sea lion and northern fur
   seal pups where their breeding grounds are sympatric. Five individuals
   from an allopatric population of California sea lions were also sampled
   for ITS-1 and D18/D19 28S sequences. The 288 D2/D3 sequences showed no
   diagnostic differences among hookworms sampled from individual sea lions
   and fur seals, whereas the 28S D18/D19 sequences had one derived
   (apomorphic) character demarcating hookworms from northern fur seals.
   ITS sequences were variable for 7 characters, with 4 derived
   (apomorphic) stares in ITS-1 demarcating hookworms from California sea
   lions. Multivariate analysis of morphometric data also revealed
   significant differences between nematodes representing these 2
   host-associated lineages. These results indicate that these hookworms
   represent 2 species that are not distributed indiscriminately between
   these host species, but instead exhibit host fidelity, evolving
   independently with each respective host species. This evolutionary
   approach to analyzing sequence data for species delimitation is
   contrasted with similarity-based methods that have been applied to
   numerous diagnostic studies of nematode parasites.}},

Abstract = {{The regulatory mechanism of the recognition and cytotoxicity by natural

   reports indicated that monoclonal antibody Cho-1-defined molecule (Cho-1
   molecule) may act as the negative regulator in the cytotoxicity by human
   NK cells. The Cho-1 molecule is composed of non-covalently asssociated
   cell surface molecules of approximately 200 kDa and 40 kDa. In the
   present study we analyzed the expression of this novel molecule in
   extravillous cytotrophoblast cells, which are presumed to be exposed to
   the cytotoxic action by maternal NK cells, from clinical cases of
   successful pregnancy and spontaneous abortion. By using monoclonal
   antibody Cho-1, our immunohistochemical data indicated that the Cho-1
   molecule is clearly expressed in the cytotrophoblast cells of the early
   phase of successful pregnancy, but only weakly expressed in those from
   spontaneous abortion. The cytotrophoblast cells in the late phase (9-10
   months) of pregnancy also expressed this molecule.
   Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis also showed that it is
   expressed on the cytotrophoblast cell surface of successful pregnancy
   but not on that of spontaneous abortion, suggesting that Cho-1 antigen
   may act as a negative regulator of the cytotoxicity by NK cells in

Title = {{Association of diabetic ketoacidosis and acute pancreatitis:
   Observations in 100 consecutive episodes of DKA}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence,
   pathogenesis, and prognosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) in diabetic
   ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is associated with nonspecific increase in serum
   amylase levels. Autopsy studies, on the other hand, had previously
   raised the issue of pancreatic necrosis in patients with DKA. However,
   the incidence, pathogenesis and prognosis of AP in the setting of DKA
   has not been prospectively evaluated.
   METHODS: This is a prospective evaluation of 100 consecutive episodes of
   DKA during a period of 13 months starting in January 1998, in a
   university hospital in New York City. In addition to careful history,
   complete blood count, arterial blood gas estimation, and a comprehensive
   metabolic assay, serum amylase, lipase, and triglyceride levels were
   estimated on admission and 48 h later. All patients with abdominal pain
   or elevated serum levels of amylase or lipase (more than three times
   normal) or triglyceride levels >5.65 mmol/L (500 mg/dl) had a CT scan of
   the abdomen. The diagnosis of AP was confirmed when pancreatic
   enlargement or necrosis on contrast enhanced CT scan was seen.
   RESULTS: Eleven patients (11\%) had AP. History of abdominal pain, not a
   feature on admission to include AP in the differential diagnosis, was
   elicited subsequently in eight patients. Abdominal pain was absent in
   two and one was comatose on admission. The etiology of AP was
   hypertriglyceridemia in four, alcohol in two, drug induced in one, and
   idiopathic in four patients. The hypertriglyceridemia was transient in
   four patients and resolved once the episode of DKA was corrected. Lipase
   elevation was noted in 29\% and amylase elevation in 21\% of all
   patients with DKA. Similar to increased amylase levels, serum lipase
   levels were also noted to be high in the absence of CT evidence of AP.
   CONCLUSIONS: DKA may mask coexisting AP, which occurs in at least
   10-15\% of cases. The pathogenesis of AP in DKA varies, but at least in
   some transient and profound hyperlipidemia is an identifiable factor. AP
   is more likely to be associated with a severe episode of DKA with marked
   acidosis and hyperglycemia. Ranson's prognostic criteria are not
   applicable to assess the severity of AP in DKA because they overestimate
   the severity. Severity index based on CT findings appears to better
   correlate with outcome. Elevation of serum lipase and amylase occur in
   DKA, and elevation of lipase levels appears to be less specific than
   amylase levels for the diagnosis of AP in the diagnosis of DKA. Although
   in this study AP in DKA. appeared to be mild, a definite conclusion with
   regard to the severity should be based only on a much larger number of
   patients, as only 20\% of patients with AP in general have serious
   disease. (Am J Gastroenterol 2000;95:2795-2800. (C) 2000 by Am. Coll. of

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report results of our study with respect to the number
   of wavelength division multiplexer/demultiplexers that should be
   provided in optical cross-connect switches (optical XCs) installed in
   the nodes of optical wavelength multiplexed transmission networks.
   Optical XCs perform the switching and add/drop operations of optical
   signal routes in the nodes, as well as establish lightwave paths between
   two arbitrary nodes. In many cases, the optical XCs proposed in the past
   had wavelength division multiplexer/demultiplexers connected to all
   input/output optical fibers that, after separating all lightwave paths
   transmitting wavelength multiplexed signals, performed switch and
   add/drop operations. However, when all lightwave paths input in an
   optical XC from an optical fiber are relayed to only one different
   output optical fiber, there is no need to perform wavelength
   demultiplexing between the input and output optical fibers. If a light
   wave path passes through a node without separation of optical signals as
   they were multiplexed in the optical fiber (cut-through), the number of
   wavelength division multiplexer/demultiplexers can be reduced. The
   authors considered two algorithms for lightwave path allocations whose
   purpose is to minimize the number of wavelength division
   multiplexer/demultiplexers and evaluated them on an example of an m x n
   mesh network. The results of evaluation suggest that it is possible to
   reduce the number of wavelength division, multiplexer/demultiplexers
   that must be installed by 10\% to several dozen percent compared to the
   case when the dividers are installed on all input fibers. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study attempts to elucidate the relative contributions
   of exogenous and endogenous components to the N140 and P300 potentials
   elicited by somatosensory stimulation.
   Methods: Somatosensory event-related potentials (ERPs) were evoked using
   an odd-ball paradigm with the frequent (80\%) stimuli delivered to the
   left index finger and the infrequent (20\%) stimuli delivered to the
   right index finger. Both types of stimuli had the same intensity within
   each experiment. The experiment was repeated using 6 different stimulus
   intensities ranging from the sensory threshold to 3 times the threshold.
   Each experiment was done under two conditions. In one, the subjects were
   asked to count and respond to the infrequent stimuli. In the other, the
   subjects were instructed to ignore the stimuli whether frequent or
   infrequent. In addition, the compound sensory potential of the right
   median nerve was separately recorded from electrodes at the wrist using
   the same range of stimulus intensities applied to the right index
   finger.
   Results: Amplitudes of the N140 and P300 elicited by both attended and
   unattended infrequent stimuli increased in a parallel fashion as a
   function of stimulus intensity, so that the amplitude difference between
   attended and unattended responses was independent of the stimulus
   intensity. The amplitude of the compound sensory nerve potential at the
   wrist exhibited a similar slope to those of the N140 and P300.
   Conclusions: Thus, it is concluded that the scalp N140 and P300 consist
   of two components: an endogenous component, which is independent of the
   stimulus intensity, and an exogenous component, which increases as a
   function of stimulus intensity. The relative contribution of these
   components to the N140 and P300 amplitudes is also discussed. (C) 2000

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background-Delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to tuberculin is
   an important marker of T helper 1 (Th1) mediated acquired immunity
   against tuberculosis. Depressed DTH responses to tuberculin are observed
   in immobile elderly individuals with reduced activities of daily living
   (ADL) scores. Immobility in older people increases the risk of pneumonia
   related mortality. The decline in the competence of the immune system
   might be a reason for the increased susceptibility to infection in the
   elderly and the depressed DTH response to tuberculin might be a
   predictor for increased risk of pneumonia.
   Method-The DTH responses to tuberculin were examined in 49 older
   patients with limited ADL of similar severity, all of whom had a past
   history of positive DTH responses to tuberculin. Responses with an
   induration diameter of greater than or equal to 10 mm were considered
   positive. Reactivities of Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes taken from the
   peripheral blood of each subject were also examined and compared between
   the positive tuberculin responders and the negative tuberculin
   responders. The rates of pneumonia in these groups were then compared
   prospectively for two years.
   Results-The number of CD4 lymphocytes differed significantly between
   patients with a positive tuberculin response (n=22, mean (SE) 1018 (118)
   x 10(6)/1) and those with a negative response (n=27, 666 (80) x 10(6)/1,
   p=0.02). Likewise, the number of Th1 cells was significantly higher in
   positive tuberculin responders than in negative responders (276 (5.8) x
   10(6)/1 versus 149 (14) x 10(6)/1, p=0.01). However, the numbers of Th2
   cells were similar between patients with positive and negative responses
   (22 (3) x 10(6)/1 versus 19 (3) x 10(6)/1, p=0.41). During the follow up
   period new pneumonia was diagnosed in 18 (67\%) of the 27 negative
   tuberculin responders and in seven (31\%) of the 22 positive tuberculin
   responders. According to the Cox regression model, a hazard ratio of
   developing pneumonia in patients with a negative tuberculin response
   compared with those with a positive tuberculin response was 2.57 (95\%
   CI 1.12 to 6.17, p=0.03).
   Conclusion-The diminished DTH response to tuberculin may be a predictor
   for increased risk of pneumonia in elderly disabled patients.}},

Abstract = {{The 26S proteasome is a non-lysosomal multicatalytic protease complex
   for degrading intracellular proteins by ATP/ubiquitin-dependent
   proteolysis. Tightly ordered proteasomal degradation of proteins
   critical for cell cycle control implies a role of the proteasome in
   maintaining cell proliferation and cell survival. In this study, we
   demonstrate that cell-permeable proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin,
   benzyloxycarbonyl(Z)-leucyl-leucyl-leucinal (ZLLLal; MG-132) and
   4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenylacetyl-leucyl-leucine vinyl sulfone
   (NLVS), induce apoptosis abundantly in p53-defective leukemic cell lines
   CCRF-CEM, U937 and K562 as well as in myelogenic and lymphatic leukemic
   cells obtained from adult individuals with relapsed acute leukemias.
   Leukemic cell apoptosis induced by the proteasome inhibitors was
   dependent on activation of caspase-3 and related caspase family pro
   teases, because caspase-3 inhibitor
   N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamyl-L-valyl-L-aspartal (Ac-DEVD-cho) and,
   more effectively, the general casp ase-inhibitor
   N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-valyl-L-alanyl- L-aspartate fluoromethylketone
   (Z-VAD-fmk) were capable of blocking apoptosis induced by lactacystin,
   ZLLLal or NLVS. Induction of apoptosis by lactacystin or ZLLLal was
   accompanied by cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and by accumulation and
   stabilization of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/Cip) and
   tumor suppressor protein p53. A role of p53 in mediating apoptosis or
   induction of p21(WAF/Cip1) was ruled out since CCRF-CEM and U937 cells
   express non-functional mutant p53, and K562 cells lack expression of
   p53. Viability and hematopoietic outgrowth of human CD34 + progenitor
   cells treated with lactacystin were slightly reduced, whereas treatment
   of CD34 + cells with ZLLLal or the cytostatic drugs doxorubicin and
   gemcitabine resulted in markedly reduced viability and hematopoietic
   outgrowth. These results demonstrate a basic role of the proteasome in
   maintaining survival of human leukemic cells, and may define
   cell-permeable proteasome inhibitors as potently anti-leukemic agents
   which exhibit a moderate hematopoietic toxicity in vitro.}},

Abstract = {{The distributional performance of the cost of a partial match query is
   investigated in some sorts of K-d trees. The trees under consideration
   are Bentley's K-d tree, the locally balanced K-d-t tree, and the random
   relaxed K-d tree. For each of these trees it is proved that in the
   uniform probabilistic model the normalized cost of a partial match query
   converges in distribution. The limiting distributions occur as fixed
   points of random affine operators. Also explicit first-order asymptotic
   expansions for the variances of the costs and results on exponential
   moments are derived. The analysis is based on the contraction method.

Abstract = {{The Huntington disease gene encodes the protein huntingtin, which is
   widely expressed during embryonic development and in mature tissues. In
   order to elucidate the physiological function of huntingtin, which so
   far is unknown, we intend to study the effect of antisense downregulated
   huntingtin expression. We have found an inhibiting effect of a
   phosphorothioated oligodeoxynucleotide (PS-ODN) added to the culture
   medium of embryonic teratocarcinoma cells (NT2) and postmitotic neurons
   (NT2N neurons) differentiated from the NT2 cells. Specific inhibition of
   expression of endogenous huntingtin was achieved in NT2N neurons in the
   concentration range of 1-5 muM PS-ODN, whereas no inhibition was
   obtained in NT2 cells. We describe in detail the selection of the target
   sequence for the antisense oligo and the uptake, intracellular
   distribution, and stability of the antisense PS-ODN in the two cell
   types. Antisense down-regulation of huntingtin in this model of human
   neurons represents a suitable approach to study its normal function.}},

Abstract = {{Rhodobacter sphaeroides grew in the presence of up to 43 muM chromate
   and reduced hexavalent chromium to the trivalent form under both aerobic
   and anaerobic conditions. Reduced chromium remained in the external
   medium. Reductase activity was present in cells of Rb. sphaeroides
   independent of whether chromate was present or not in the growth medium.
   The reducing activity was found in the cytoplasmic cell fraction and was
   dependent on NADH. The chromate-reducing enzyme was purified by anion
   exchange, hydroxyapatite and hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and
   gel filtration. The molecular weight of the enzyme was 42 kDa as
   determined by gel filtration. The optimum of the reaction is at pH 7.0
   and 30 degreesC. The enzyme activity showed a hyperbolic dependence on
   the concentrations of both substrates, NADH and chromate, with a maximum
   velocity at 0.15 mM NADH. A K-m of 15+/-1.3 muM CrO42- and a V-max of
   420+/-50 mu mol min(-1) mg protein(-1) was determined for the enzyme
   isolated from anaerobically grown cells and 29+/-6.4 muM CrO42- and

Abstract = {{The electrostatic interaction of charged particles through or at a
   low-dielectric slab, such as a lipid bilayer immersed in water or a
   self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on a metal substrate, is considered
   theoretically in the presence of salt within the Gaussian approximation
   using a generalized Green's formalism. A number of separate situations
   are discussed: i) The presence of a low-dielectric slab leads to
   pronounced interactions of a single charge with the slab via the
   formation of polarization surface charges. For SAMs on metal substrates,
   there is an intricate crossover from image-charge attraction to the
   metal substrate (for large distances) to image-charge repulsion from the
   SAM (for small distances) with a stable minimum at a distance of roughly
   20 times the thickness of the hydrophobic film. For bilayers in mater,
   the interaction of a single charge is always repulsive. ii) The surface
   potential of a SAM is calculated for the case when the hydrophobic layer
   contains dipole moments, which might explain the recently observed
   long-ranged repulsion of hydrophobic scanning tips from PEG-terminated
   SAMs on gold. iii) The interaction between charged particles through the
   bilayer is weakened. Oppositely charged particles still attract each
   other through the membrane. The free-energy minimum occurs as a result
   of the competition between self-repulsion from the slab and
   interparticle attraction and is located at a separation from the
   membrane surface which equals 15 times the membrane thickness, iv)
   Surface charges on the two surfaces of a bilayer attract each other
   through the bilayer unless the surface charge densities are the same,
   even if the signs are the same. v) All these effects are strongly
   influenced by the presence of salt.}},

Abstract = {{Background This study is a development of the work done in `Preliminary
   criteria for the definition of allergic rhinitis: a systematic
   evaluation of clinical parameters in a disease cohort (I)'.
   Objective We sought to develop criteria which could be routinely used to
   define allergic rhinitis.
   Methods A total of 47 allergic rhinitis and 23 normal subjects were
   evaluated with a detailed questionnaire and history, physical
   examination, serum total immunoglobulin (Ig) E, skin prick tests and
   serum EAST's.
   Results Based on this data, we developed a preliminary scoring system by
   which a reliable diagnosis of allergic rhinitis can be made, which is
   based on the prevalence adjusted strength of association delta (partial
   derivative) rank values described in this report. Cumulative frequency
   histograms were constructed for allergic rhinitis and normal subjects in
   a variety of configurations.
   Conclusion A simple scoring system which can be used to diagnose
   allergic rhinitis on a routine basis was developed in this study.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate theoretically how the stress propagation characteristics
   of granular materials evolve as they are subjected to increasing
   pressures, comparing the results of a two-dimensional scalar lattice
   model to those of a molecular dynamics simulation of slightly
   polydisperse disks. We characterize the statistical properties of the
   forces using the force histogram and a two-point spatial correlation
   function of the forces. For the lattice model, in the granular limit the
   force histogram has an exponential tail at large forces, while in the
   elastic regime the force histogram is much narrower, and has a form that
   depends on the realization of disorder in the model. The behavior of the
   force histogram in the molecular dynamics simulations as the pressure is
   increased is very similar to that displayed by the lattice model. In
   contrast, the spatial correlations evolve qualitatively differently in
   the lattice model and in the molecular dynamics simulations. For the
   lattice model, in the granular limit there are no in-plane stress-stress
   correlations, whereas in the molecular dynamics simulation significant
   in-plane correlations persist to the lowest pressures studied.}},

   surgery in a single institution was reviewed. Toxicity, local control
   and survival were evaluated and compared to previous studies with
   similarly staged patients. Long-term follow-up was available on 35
   patients. The actuarial local failure was 5.7\% while the actuarial
   5-year survival was 87\%. The mortality rate was low (2.5\%) and the
   rate of long-term serious complications acceptable (11.4\%). Combined
   preoperative chemotherapy and radiation provided excellent local
   regional control despite the poor prognostic factors associated with
   size, fixation, and the initial advanced tumor stage with acceptable
   morbidity. In addition, patients with tumors located in the lower third
   of the rectum may be able to undergo sphincter-sparing surgery. Although
   the median follow-up is relatively short (32.4 months), the results are
   in accordance with previous studies of neoadjuvant combined chemotherapy
   and radiation for locally advanced rectal carcinoma in terms of local

Abstract = {{It has frequently been observed that certain roof tiles and bricks,
   especially from relatively modern European buildings, do not contain
   enough quartz grains in a suitable grain size range to permit dose
   reconstruction using thermoluminescence (TL) or optically stimulated
   luminescence (OSL) methods. In this paper the feasibility of using
   infrared-stimulated luminescence (IRSL) on the feldspar fraction of such
   bricks and tiles has been investigated. Appropriate preheating
   treatments were employed in order to select the most stable signals, and
   procedures were developed to enhance the signal to noise ratio. The
   possible effect of anomalous fading under application of these
   procedures was tested. In the dose range above 100 mGy, it has been
   demonstrated that using IRSL on the feldspar fraction of such material
   provides a feasible alternative to the use of green-light-stimulated
   luminescence (GLSL) on the quartz fraction, for the purposes of
   retrospective dosimetry, Furthermore, since the use of IRSL as described
   in this paper involves the measurement of polymineral fine grain
   fractions of bricks, a technique for the calibration of the built-in
   beta source against the gamma source in Secondary Standard Dosimetry
   facilities for routine use of the technique is described. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Inversion zones are elongate structures, some tens of kilometers wide
   and up to hundreds of kilometers long, that have deformed in response to

   although very important in the geologic picture, the conditions of their
   formation and evolution and their regional geologic significance are not
   entirely understood. The internal structure of inversion zones is
   variable and depends on details in the pre-inversion setting, the
   inversion-inducing stress held, and the sedimentary fill. However, on a
   larger scale, most inversion zones share certain principal observational
   features, which sample the physical structure and the theologic
   properties of the lithosphere and thereby provide an opportunity to test
   hypotheses of lithospheric rheology and dynamics. The quantitative model
   presented in this paper explains how inversion zones and the associated
   marginal troughs are related to Lithospheric zones of differential
   shortening and regional isostatic compensation of the induced

Abstract = {{Curved guide tubes to transport high-speed pellets are used for pellet
   injection into plasma devices. This article describes the transport
   process of the high-speed pellets through curved guide tubes. The
   pellets pass through the curved tubes with repeating reflections. Using
   the equation of friction at each reflection point, the velocity and the
   direction of the output pellet are calculated by following the pellet
   trajectory. The analytic expressions, with respect to the velocity and
   the direction of the output pellet, are also derived. It has been
   confirmed that there is good correspondence between the results obtained
   by following the pellet trajectories, those by the analytic expressions
   and those by the experiments. The analytic expressions are particularly
   useful for the design and making of the curved guide tubes used in the
   pellet injection. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is becoming increasingly
   recognized as an important regulator of immune and inflammatory
   responses. It is released by activated T lymphocytes and macrophages and
   up-regulates the proinflammatory activity of these cells. MIF is
   required for antigen- and mitogen-driven T cell activation, and
   stimulates macrophages to release cytokines and nitric oxide. On the
   basis of the recent suggestion that pharmacological modulation of MIF
   production and neutralization of its activity may have important
   implications for treatment of a variety of autoimmune or inflammatory
   conditions, we determined the level of MIF in the cerebrospinal fluid
   (CSF) of patients with conventional-form multiple sclerosis (C-MS) and
   optic-spinal form multiple sclerosis (OpS-MS), and neuro-Behcet's
   disease (NBD). As control, the CSF of patients with non-inflammatory
   neurological diseases (NIND) was used. The concentration of MIF in CSF
   samples was significantly elevated in relapsed cases of C-MS
   (4.13+/-1.07 ng/ml) (mean+/-S.D.) compared with control samples
   (2.38+/-0.60 ng/ml) (P < 0.0001), whereas MIF in the CSF of C-MS
   patients in remission was not elevated (2.65+/-0.67 ng/ml). The
   concentration of MIF in the CSF of OpS-MS patients in relapse
   (5.53+/-1.74 ng/ml) was higher than that of patients with C-MS in
   relapse (P < 0.05). In NBD patients, the concentration of MIF in CSF was
   significantly elevated (7.47+/-5.61 ng/ml) compared with control samples
   (P < 0.01) and correlated well with cell count in these samples (r =
   0.910, P < 0.005). These results suggest that MIF may play a pivotal
   role in immune-mediated diseases of the central nervous system, and that
   MIF may be useful in the study of differences between C-MS and OpS-MS.

Abstract = {{We have demonstrated saturated output on several nickel-like ion X-ray
   lasers ranging from niobium to silver by using a psec, high-power,
   chirped-pulse-amplification, tabletop laser. These results have been
   achieved at wavelengths from 20.3 to 13.9 nm on the Ni-like
   3d(9)4d(1)S(o) --> 3d(9)4p(1)P(1) laser line using a total of 5 to 7 J
   of energy in a traveling wave excitation scheme. Strong amplification is
   also observed for Ni-like Sn at 11.9 nm. Gain of 41 cm(-1), gain-length
   product of 18, and output energy of 12 muJ are measured for the Ni-like
   Pd line at 14.7 nm. For Ni-Iike Mo, experiments are done using
   multilayer mirrors to obtain two-dimensional images of the output
   aperture of the laser and to measure the total laser energy as a
   function of various parameters such as the delay between the short and
   long pulses and the energy of the two pulses. For Mo we measure an
   output energy of 2 muJ and a gain-length product of 16.6. To model the
   Mo experiments, the LASNEX code is used to calculate the hydrodynamic
   evolution of the plasma and provide the temperatures and densities to
   the XRASER code, which then does the kinetics calculations to determine
   the gain. The temporal and spatial evolution of the plasma is studied
   both with and without radiation transport included for the 4f and 4p -->
   3d Ni-like Mo resonance lines. High gains are predicted and observed for
   both the 3d(9)4d(1)S(o) --> 3d(9)4p(1)P(1) laser line at 18.9 nm and the
   3d(9)4f(1)P(1) --> 3d(9)4d(1)P(1) photopumped line at 22.6 nm. (C) 2000

   structures induced by the bond impurities are investigated both in the
   ground state and at very low temperatures. The local magnetic structure
   can be looked on as an effective S = 1/2 spin and the weakness of the
   interaction between the local structures causes the quasidegenerate
   states in the low energy. We also investigate the force acting between
   bond impurities and find that the force is generally attractive. We also
   study the dynamical property of the local magnetic structure. While the
   local magnetic structure behaves as an isolated S = 1/2 spin in the
   response to a time-dependent uniform field, it is found to be robust

Abstract = {{Cartilage function after resurfacing with cell-based transplantation
   procedures or during the early stages of arthritic disease may be
   bolstered by the addition of growth factor genes to the transplanted
   tissue. Insulinlike growth factor-I maintains chondrocyte metabolism in
   normal cartilage homeostasis and has been shown to improve cartilage
   healing in vivo. Given the relatively short half-life of insulinlike
   growth factor-I in biologic systems, however, maintenance of effective
   concentrations of this peptide has necessitated either very high initial
   doses or repeated treatment. Delivery of the insulinlike growth factor-I
   gene, using a deleted adenovirus vector, specifically targeting
   graftable articular chondrocytes, bone marrow-derived chondroprogenitor
   cells, or synovial lining cells, may provide more durable insulinlike
   growth factor-I fluxes to articular tissues. Cultured equine articular
   chondrocytes, mesenchymal stem cells, synovial explants, and synovial
   intimal cells were readily transfected with an E1-deleted adenoviral
   vector containing equine insulinlike growth factor-I coding sequence.
   Optimal viral concentrations for effective transduction were 100
   multiplicities of infection in synoviocytes, 500 multiplicities of
   infection in chondrocytes, and 1000 multiplicities of infection in
   mesenchymal stem cells. Production of insulinlike growth factor-I ligand
   varied from 65 ng/mL to 246 ng/mL in medium from chondrocytes and
   synovial explants, respectively. For chondrocytes, these concentrations
   were sufficient to produce significant stimulation of cartilage matrix
   gene expression and subsequent proteoglycan production. Moreover, cells
   in infected cultures maintained a chondrocytic phenotype and continued
   to express elevated insulinlike growth factor-I levels during 28 days of
   monolayer culture. Minimal synthetic activity, other than insulinlike
   growth factor-I ligand synthesis, was evident in synovial cultures.
   These experiments suggest several avenues for insulinlike growth
   factor-I supplementation of articular cartilage, including
   preimplantation adenoviral-insulinlike growth factor gene transfer to
   chondrocytes or chondroprogenitor cells, and direct injection of
   adenoviral-insulinlike growth factor to transfect the synovial
   structures in situ.}},

Abstract = {{PCR techniques have significantly improved the detection and
   identification of bacterial pathogens. Countless adaptations and
   applications have been described, including quantitative PCR and the
   latest innovation, real-time PCR, In real-time PCR, e.g., the
   5'-nuclease chemistry renders the automated and direct detection and
   quantification of PCR products possible (P. M. Holland et al,, Proc.
   Natl. Acad. Sci, USA 88:7276-7280, 1991), We present an assay for the
   quantitative detection of Listeria monocytogenes based on the
   5'-nuclease PCR using a 113-bp amplicon from the listeriolysin O gene
   (hlyA) as the target. The assay was positive for all isolates of L.
   monocytogenes tested (65 isolates including the type strain) and
   negative for ail other Listeria strains (16 isolates from five species
   tested) and several other bacteria (18 species tested). The application
   of 5'-nuclease PCR in diagnostics requires a quantitative sample
   preparation step. Several magnetic bead-based strategies were evaluated,
   since these systems are simple and relatively easy to automate. The
   combination of nonspecific binding of bacteria to paramagnetic beads,
   with subsequent DNA purification by use of the same beads, gave the most
   satisfactory result. The detection limit was approximately 6 to 60 CFU,
   quantification was linear over at least 7 log units, and the method
   could be completed within 3 h, In conclusion, a complete quantitative
   method for L. monocytogenes in water and in skimmed and raw milk was
   developed.}},

Abstract = {{Cytochrome c (cyt. c) is a proapoptotic factor that binds preferentially
   to cardiolipin (CL), a mitochondrial lipid, but not to cardiolipin
   hydroperoxide (CL-OOH). Cyt. c that had bound to CL liposomes was
   liberated on peroxidation of the liposomes by a radical. The generation
   of CL-OOH in mitochondria occurred before the release of cyt. c in rat
   basophile leukaemia (RBL)2H3 cells that had been induced to undergo
   apoptosis by exposure to hypoglycaemia with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). The
   amount of cyt. c bound to CL prepared from the mitochondria of
   2DG-treated cells was lower than that of untreated cells. The release of
   cyt. c was completely suppressed when the production of CL-OOH in
   mitochondria was inhibited by the overexpression of mitochondrial
   phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx). The
   fluorescence from CL-labelling dye (10-N-nonyl Acridine Orange)
   decreased on the induction of apoptosis by 2DG. However, no decrease in
   fluorescence was observed in PHGPx-overexpressing cells. Cyt. c was
   released from mitochondria that had been isolated from control cells on
   peroxidation by t-butylhydroperoxide, but no similar liberation of cyt.
   c from mitochondria isolated from mitochondrial PHGPx-overexpressing
   cells was observed. These findings suggest that the generation of CL-OOH
   in mitochondria might be a primary event that triggers the release of
   cyt. c from mitochondria in the apoptotic process in which mitochondrial
   PHGPx participates as an anti-apoptotic factor by preventing the
   formation of CL-OOH.}},

Abstract = {{Even though most fungal hydrolytic enzymes have been successfully

   overexpression of A. oryzae RNase T1 causes severe growth inhibition in

   control of the GAL1 promoter with a single-copy vector were able to grow
   on galactose medium while those with a multi-copy vector were not. It
   was found that overexpression of three mutated versions of RNase T1 with
   low enzymatic activity did not affect the growth. We also observed that
   expression of RNase T1 without a signal sequence severely inhibited
   growth of the transformant even on the single-copy plasmid. Subcellular
   fractionation showed that overexpressed myc-tagged RNase T1 was
   localized in the membrane fraction. In the yeast secretory pathway,
   while the mutants defective in translocation into the ER, ER-Golgi
   trafficking and vacuole formation had severe growth inhibition during
   expression of RNase T1 from the single-copy plasmid. These results
   suggest that a mislocalization of active RNase T1 in cytosol by overflow

Abstract = {{The knowledge of self-diffusion of various elements is important for
   understanding and elucidating the long-term dissolution of the nuclear
   waste glass.
   The self-diffusion coefficients of Na and Cs in P0798 simulated nuclear
   waste glass have been measured by an ion beam sputter-sectioning
   technique using the radioactive isotopes Na-22 and Cs-137. The
   temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficients in each temperature
   range in P0798 glass below the glass transition temperature T-g can be
   expressed by the following equations:
   (428 similar to 574 K): DNa-below Tg=2.7 x 10(-6) exp (-113+/-4
   kJ.mol(-1)/RT)m(2).s(-1)
   (713 similar to 758 K): DCs-below Tg=7.1 x 10(-5) exp (-241+/-10
   kJ.mol(-1)/RT)m(2).s(-1)
   The Na-22 diffusivity was about ten orders of magnitude larger than
   Cs-137 diffusivity at 573 K. The large difference in the diffusion
   coefficients is explained in terms of the ion size effect, the
   mixed-alkali effect and lower Cs concentration compared with Na in P0798
   glass.}},

   disjoint paths between every pair of nodes u, v. For k = max k(u)

   algorithm for it has an approximation ratio of 2(k - 1). For a general
   instance of the problem, for no value of k greater than or equal to 2, a
   better approximation algorithm was known. We consider the case of small
   requirements k(u) epsilon \{1, 2, 3\}; these may arise in applications,
   as, in practical networks, the connectivity requirements are usually
   rather small. For this case, we give an algorithm with an approximation
   ratio of 10/3. This improves the best previously known approximation
   ratio of 4. Our algorithm also implies an improvement for arbitrary k.
   In the case in which we have an initial graph which is 2-connected, our

Abstract = {{Taxol-induced peripheral neuropathy is a commonly-occurring side-effect
   in the treatment of cancer patients with taxoteres or taxanes. Taxol is
   known to induce apoptosis in a number of tumor cells. This report
   documents that, similar to proliferating cells, taxol induces apoptosis
   in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells, as assessed by exogenous
   FITC-annexin-V binding and nuclear fragmentation. It is shown that PC12
   cells that stably overexpress Bcl-2 are protected against the toxic
   effect of taxol, as evidenced by the XTT assay and by a decreased
   fraction of propididum iodide positive cells in a dye exclusion test.
   Also the number of annexin-V-positive cells and the number of fragmented
   nuclei are lower in the Bcl-2 transfected cells. The effect is similar
   to the protective effect of Bcl-2 against NGF deprivation in
   differentiated PC12 cells. Although taxol forced both wild-type and
   Bcl-2-overexpressing cells into a mitotic state, only in
   Bcl-2-overexpressing cells did this lead to the appearance of
   metabolically active, multi-nucleated cells. This suggests that Bcl-2 is
   able to induce an alternative escape pathway, downstream of the G2/M
   block, in taxol-treated differentiated PC12 cells.}},

   basal lamina indicated that this substrate contains both an
   elastase-sensitive proximal directing cue and a collagenase-sensitive
   distal directing cue. The latter is shown to be a repellent of axon
   growth and is identical to the PROD-2 antigen that is distributed in a
   gradient along the proximal-distal axis of the leg with high levels in
   proximal regions. This means that throughout the course of their growth
   the axons extend in the direction of increasing levels of repellent. At
   a critical decision point in the trajectory the axons change both the
   direction of growth and the substrate to which their growth cones
   adhere. PROD-2 plays an essential role in both of these processes.}},

Abstract = {{Consumption of excess fat increases risk for many health problems and
   diseases. In the present study, 188 undergraduate students were studied
   to understand self-perceptions of dietary-fat intake and the impact of
   those perceptions. Findings indica ted th at the majority of
   participants had inaccurate perceptions about the amount of fat in their
   diets. Further, compared to people who overestimated dietary-fat intake,
   people who underestimated fat intake had lower perceived risk of cancer,
   had lower intentions to change, and demonstrated less knowledge about
   the dietary-fat content of many foods. Findings suggest that this
   unrealistic underestimation of fat intake is a cognitive barrier to
   dietary change and people who underestimate dietary fat intake may
   require more intensive intervention to change their diets.}},

Abstract = {{Mycobacterial preparations have been used with limited success against
   cancer apart from superficial bladder cancer. Recently, a therapeutic
   vaccine derived from Mycobacterium vaccae has been given to patients
   with prostate cancer and melanoma indicating a possible beneficial
   effect on disease activity in such patients. We have recently initiated
   a series of randomized studies to test the feasibility and toxicity of
   combining a preparation of heat-killed Mycobacterium vaccae (designated
   SRL172) with a multidrug chemotherapy regimen to treat patients with
   inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mesothelioma. 28
   evaluable patients with previously untreated symptomatic NSCLC and
   mesothelioma were randomized to receive either 3 weekly intravenous
   combination chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy given with monthly
   intra-dermal injections of SRL172. Safety and tolerability were scored
   by common toxicity criteria and efficacy was evaluated by survival of
   patients and by tumour response assessed by CT scanning. The toxicity of
   chemotherapy was similar in the two groups. SRL172 caused mild
   inflammation at the injection site. In the group of patients randomized
   to receive chemotherapy combined with SRL172, there was a trend towards
   improved response rate (54\% vs, 33\%) with more patients in the
   combined arm receiving radical surgery and radiotherapy, improved median
   survival (9.7 months vs. 7.5 months) and improved 1 year survival (42\%
   vs. 18\%), SRL172 appeared to improve sleep (P = 0.08) and improved
   appetite (P = 0.01). There was no detectable change in serum cytokine
   levels for gamma-interferon and TNF-alpha before and after treatment. in
   patients with NSCLC and mesothelioma, there may be a beneficial
   interaction when chemotherapy is administered in combination with
   SRL172. Confirmation of this effect and further investigation is
   underway in a randomized phase III trial and in laboratory models. (C)

Abstract = {{Some strains of Vibrio harveyi are known to be pathogenic for fish and

   their modes of virulence have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we
   present a previously unreported bacteriophage extracted from a

   in tropical Australia. Classification into the family Myoviridae was
   based upon morphological characteristics (an icosahedral head, a
   neck/collar region and a sheathed rigid tail) and nucleic acid
   characteristics (double-stranded linear DNA). We have termed the
   bacteriophage VHML (Vibrio Harveyi Myovirus Like). VHML is a temperate
   bacteriophage that has a narrow host range and shows an apparent
   preference for V. harveyi above other vibrios (63 Vibrio isolates
   tested) and other genera (10 other genera were tested). The conventional
   methods for phage concentration and extraction of nucleic acids from
   phage particles were not efficient and the alternative methods that were

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Cost-effective strategies for identifying patients with
   Barrett's esophagus who are most likely to develop cancer have not been
   developed. Surveillance endoscopy is currently used, and we hypothesized
   that more frequent surveillance intervals would identify patients with
   ``transient positive{''} diagnoses of dysplasia-dysplasia found on one
   examination but not on subsequent ones. Our aim was to explore the
   potential economic impact of transient positive diagnoses of dysplasia
   on alternative surveillance strategies over a IO-yr period.
   METHODS: Data were derived from a 2-yr randomized, prospective study
   comparing omeprazole to ranitidine in 95 patients with Barrett's
   esophagus. A transient positive diagnosis of dysplasia was defined as a
   patient who was diagnosed with dysplasia during the study period but
   whose 24-month biopsies revealed no dysplasia. We calculated the number
   of transient positive diagnoses of dysplasia and modeled the potential
   economic impact of a diagnosis of dysplasia over a 10-yr period.
   RESULTS: Thirty patients (31\%) had at least one reading of dysplasia
   during the study period. Nineteen patients (20\%) had a transient
   positive diagnosis of dysplasia. During the study period, no cancers
   were found. A surveillance strategy of every other year and every 6
   months for dysplasia would result in 1072 endoscopies over a 10-yr
   period at a discounted cost of \$1,587,184. A total of 61\% of
   endoscopies would be because of transient positive diagnoses of
   dysplasia. A strategy of yearly surveillance and every 6 months for
   dysplasia would result in 1404 endoscopies at a discounted cost of
   \$2,096,733, of which 28\% would result from transient positive
   diagnoses of dysplasia. The discounted incremental costs of more
   frequent surveillance in this cohort of patients over 10 yr is
   \$509,549.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on current practice strategies, transient positive
   diagnoses of dysplasia account for 28-61\% of endoscopies in Barrett's
   surveillance programs. This analysis suggests that the endoscopy
   workload and costs associated with surveillance could be substantially
   reduced if patients with transient positive diagnoses of dysplasia
   reverted to usual surveillance after two negative examinations. (Am J

Abstract = {{This paper describes the inadequacies of public provision for solid
   waste collection and disposal in Benin City (and also in other Nigerian
   cities) and the limitations of the privatized schemes that have sought
   to address these inadequacies. Its description of solid waste management
   in Benin City draws on the author's interviews with 591 households which
   revealed that three-fifths had no solid waste collection service and
   which highlighted the inadequacies in the services for much of the rest.
   The paper also describes the lack of resources available to the public
   agency responsible for service provision and the inadequacies in the
   privatization scheme set trp in 1995 to address this issue. It ends by
   stressing the need for private provision arrangements that are tailored
   to the characteristics of different parts of the city and by suggesting
   the kinds of arrangements that should work better in the low-income
   areas which are generally the ones least served by conventional public
   sector or privatized arrangements.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the role of Phe101, a component of a base recognition
   site (B2 site) of a base-nonspecific RNase Rh from Rhizopus niveus, we
   prepared several enzymes mutated at this position, F101W, F101L, F101I,
   F101A, F101Q, F101R, and F101K, and their enzymatic activities towards
   RNA, 16 dinucleoside phosphates, and 2', 3'-cyclic pyrimidine
   nucleotides were measured. Enzymatic activity toward RNA of F101W,
   F101L, and F101I were about 7, 20, and 3.8\% of the native enzyme,
   respectively, and those of the other mutants were Less than 1\% of the
   RNase Rh. Similar results were also obtained with GpG as substrate.
   Thus, it was concluded that Phe101 is a very important residue as a
   component of the B2 site of RNase Rh, and its role could be replaced by
   Leu, then Trp and Ile, though in less effectively. The results suggested
   that some kind of interaction between B2 base and the side chain of
   amino acid residue at the 101th position, such as pi/pi or CH/pi
   interaction is very important for the enzymatic activity of RNase Rh.
   The mutation of Phe101 markedly affected the enzymatic activity toward
   dinucleoside phosphates and polymer substrates, but only moderately the
   rate of hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotides, indicating the presence of
   secondary effect of the mutation on B1 site.}},

   minor property values as inconsistent with widgets that have major ones,
   as human evaluators do. We also propose a method for recording widget
   property values. This method records the data by using GUI application
   executables, not GUI resource files. We have developed a computer tool,
   GUITESTER2, which can implement the proposed methods. The tool could
   detect inconsistencies in labeling terminology, button locations, etc.,
   for existing GUI applications, which confirmed the effectiveness of the
   tool.}},

Abstract = {{Highly water soluble {[}60]fullerene (C-60) end-capped vinyl ether (VE)
   oligomers with well-defined structure were synthesized by living
   cationic polymerization technique. The addition reaction between
   1-octynylfulleride anion and oligomeric cationic species of VEs with
   pendant acetoxyl or malonic ester functions afforded the precursor C-60
   end-capped oligomers. The living VE oligomers were prepared by living
   cationic polymerization of diethyl 2-(vinyloxy)ethylmalonate (VOEM) and
   2-acetoxy-ethyl vinyl ether (AcOVE) by the CH3CH(OR)Cl/ZnI2 {[}R =
   CH2CH2OCOCH3 and CH2CH2CH(COOEt)(2), respectively] initiating system.
   The precursors were obtained as dark brown gummy solid in 33 and 72\%
   yield for AcOVE and VOEM, respectively. UV-vis and C-13 NMR spectroscopy
   indicated the formation of 1,2-disubstituted dihydrofullerene

   the water-soluble C-60 end-capped oligomer with oligo(VOEMNa) chain to
   have the excellent aqueous solubility compared to that of the
   water-soluble C-60 derivatives thus far known; the maximum solubility in
   water is 96.6 mg/mL, which corresponds to 25.9 mg/mL of the C-60 moiety.

Abstract = {{Residue analyses and ecotoxicity assessment were conducted on the new
   antifouling compound Irgarol 1051
   (2-methylthio-4-tert-butylamino-6-cyclopropylamino-s-triazine) and its
   degradation product M1
   (2-methylthio-4-tert-butylamino-6-amino-s-triazine) in order to
   delineate the environmental fate and impact of Irgarol 1051 on the
   aquatic ecosystem. For the first time, the Irgarol degradation product
   (M1) was positively identified in environmental samples. During the 1998
   Irgarol survey, concentrations of M1 (up to 1870 ng/l) were generally
   higher than those of Irgarol in the coastal waters of the Seto Inland
   Sea in Japan, suggesting a greater environmental persistence for M1 than
   for the parent compound Irgarol 1051 in the aquatic ecosystem.
   Ecotoxicity testing revealed that Irgarol 1051 and M1 were moderately
   toxic to a marine bacterium and the four crustaceans tested, but were
   highly toxic to some algae and higher plants. In the root elongation
   inhibition bioassay, M1 showed a phytotoxicity at least 10 times greater
   than that of Irgarol and six other triazine herbicides (terbutryn,
   terbutylazine, terbumeton, simetryn, atrazine and simazine). These
   results strongly suggest that both Irgarol 1051 and its persistent
   degradation product M1 may potentially affect and/or damage the primary
   producer community in aquatic ecosystems. To safeguard the aquatic
   ecosystem from the damaging impact of micro contaminants, it is
   recommended that, besides monitoring for the target parent compound,
   major degradation products should also be included in environmental
   surveys. Otherwise, then is a risk of underestimating the ultimate
   impact of a particular toxicant on the environment. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{As part of a program to select ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex
   Laws.) genotypes for improved drought tolerance, we examined
   physiological and morphological characteristics of 12 half-sib families
   of ponderosa pine from four seed sources; New Mexico, South Dakota,
   Nebraska, and Wyoming. We analyzed genetic variation in carbon isotope
   discrimination (Delta), photosynthetic gas exchange, needle morphology,
   and growth of 2-year-old seedlings from the four seed sources grown
   under two levels of moisture availability. To gain a better
   understanding of within-provenance variation and identify opportunities
   to refine selection strategies, we also examined family within seed
   source variation in the traits. Water stress significantly (P < 0.05)
   reduced net photosynthesis (A), needle conductance to water vapor (gwv),
   carbon isotope discrimination (Delta), and growth of the seedlings as
   compared to well-watered seedlings. However, instantaneous water use
   efficiency (A/gwv) did not differ between water treatments. Seedlings
   from New Mexico had significantly lower gwv and higher A/gwv than
   seedlings from the other sources. Carbon isotope discrimination was
   lowest for seedlings from New Mexico and Nebraska. Families within seed
   sources varied significantly in A, gwv, stomatal density, needle length,
   height increment, and Delta. Carbon isotope discrimination was
   significantly correlated with gwv but not with A, supporting results
   from mature trees suggesting that variation in Delta in ponderosa pine
   is more related to gwv than to A. Seed source + water treatment
   interactions were not observed for any of the traits analyzed. These
   results support our previous assertion that genotype + environment
   interaction in Delta of mature ponderosa pine trees from these sources
   grown in Nebraska and Oklahoma was related to factors other than
   moisture availability.}},

Abstract = {{A study comparing bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and cyclin A as markers of
   cells in the S-phase in oral precancerous lesions was performed. These
   were also compared with the growth fraction (GF) as assessed by Ki-67.
   Biopsies of 15 lesions were obtained, presenting clinically as
   leuhoplakia or erythroplakia of the lateral tongue or floor of mouth.
   Half of each biopsy was incubated in BrdU and routinely fixed and
   processed. Sequential sections from each block were cut and stained
   immunohistochemically with antibodies against the following proteins:
   BrdU, Ki-67 and cyclin A. Stained sections were quantified and the
   labelling indices (LI) expressed per 100 of the total nucleated cell
   population (\%) and per millimetre basement length (/mm). The mean LI\%
   for BrdU was 11.24\% (SD 2.83), for cyclin A it was 12.76\% (SD 3.88)
   and the GF\% was 29.25\% (SD 11.88). The mean Ll/mm for BrdU was
   40.93/mm (SD 11.88), for cyclin A it was 47.59/mm (SD 18.28) and the
   GF/mm was 110.72/mm (SD 49.30). The BrdU and cyclin A indices were
   significantly correlated with each other. In the more dysplastic cases,
   the cyclin A LI was quantitatively much larger than that for BrdU,
   suggesting that the protein was being overexpressed. It was concluded
   that as a tool to study the kinetic aspects of the cell cycle in
   dysplastic lesions cyclin A was limited by the fact that it is
   overexpressed. In minimally dysplastic lesions and normal epithelia,
   however, cyclin A may be a viable alternative to BrdU for the study of
   the S-phase.}},

Title = {{Effect of curcumin on the production of nitric oxide by cultured rat
   mammary gland}},
Journal = {{NITRIC OXIDE-BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{505-515}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We have hypothesized that one aspect of the antitumor activity of
   curcumin (diferuloylmethane) during the promotion stage of mammary gland
   tumorigenesis may be linked to reduction of free radicals (Inano et al.,
   Carcinogenesis, 20: 1011-1018, 1999). Nitric oxide (NO) has been found
   to inflict damage on important biomolecules, and the overproduction of
   NO in diseases may be implicated in carcinogenesis and tumor
   progression. We have reported that the presence of three isoforms of
   nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and NO generation in the mammary gland
   correlate with the mammary gland development and mammary carcinogenesis.
   We, therefore, investigated the inhibitory activity of curcumin for the
   production of NO in rat mammary glands by using an organ culture system
   to validate the effectiveness and usefulness of curcumin in the
   pathophysiology of the mammary gland. A diced mammary gland
   (approximately 3 mm cubes) from the inguinal part of a female Wistar-MS
   rat treated with estradiol and progesterone was cultured with 2 mi of
   5\% FCS/DMEM in the presence or absence of LPS (0.5 mug/ml) for 2-3
   days. Curcumin (similar to 100 muM) was added at the same time to the
   LPS-treated cultures. In some experiments, curcumin was added to the
   culture after the LPS had been washed out. The NO production was
   significantly increased (by almost 20-fold compared to the control) by
   the addition of LPS to the culture system. This enhancement of NO
   production by LPS was reduced to 76 and to 56\% by addition of 30 and
   100 muM curcumin, respectively, to the culture. When LPS was eliminated
   from the culture after prestimulation for 1 day, the production of NO by
   the mammary gland dropped off, although some NO was still detectable.
   Curcumin did not further inhibit the production of NO by the
   prestimulated mammary gland after the elimination of LPS from the
   culture. The inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, 122 kDa) and
   endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS, 152 kDa) isoforms were detected
   in the mammary gland extracts at the end of the organ culture. The
   quantity of iNOS was apparently increased in the gland treated with LPS,
   while the eNOS expression was clearly diminished. Curcumin (100 muM)
   obviously suppressed the iNOS expression in the mammary glands cultured
   with LPS, and a recovery in the eNOS expression was observed. On the
   other hand, curcumin exhibited scavenging activity for the NO released
   from N-ethyl-2-(1-ethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazino)-ethanamine (NOC
   12), a NO donor compound, in the coincubation mixture. These results
   indicate that curcumin has the ability to inhibit iNOS induction by LPS
   in the mammary gland and to scavenge NO radicals, which might explain,
   at least partly, its therapeutic properties in inflammation of the
   mammary gland. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the expression of OX40, an activated memory T-cell marker,
   and its ligand (OX40L), a set of molecules for T-cell-B-cell
   interaction, and other lymphocyte activation markers in the thymuses of
   myasthenia gravis (MG) and controls. Material and methods - We studied
   the expression of OX40, OX40L, IL-2R alpha and HLA-DR in the thymic
   tissues of MG and controls using immunocytochemistry and flowcytometry.
   Results - In both hyperplastic thymus of MG and control thymus, OX40(+)
   cells were scattered mainly in the medulla with much fewer OX40L(+)
   cells being distributed in the corticomedullary junctions. IL-2R alpha
   and HLA-DR were expressed in the medulla at higher frequencies as
   compared with OX40 in controls as well as MG. In contrast, the numbers
   of OX40(+) cells around the germinal centers (GC) were significantly
   greater than those of control thymuses, and some mononuclear cells in CC
   were OX40L(+). A considerable number of OX40(+) cells were seen in the
   thymic tissues adjacent to thymomas. OX40 (+) cells were CD4(+) CD8(-)
   or CD4(+)CD8(+) and were mostly HLA-DR-. (The coexpression of OX40 and
   IL-2R alpha on activated CD4(+) T cells was previously reported.)
   Conclusion - OX40, expressed in a fraction of activated CD4(+) T cells,
   may be upregulated in thymic tissues adjacent to GC and thymoma in MG,
   and OX40 may interact with OX40L in GC to enhance anti-acetylcholine
   receptor antibody production in MG.}},

Abstract = {{The main thrust of research will be the prevention of renal disease and
   its progression to the end-stage state (ESRD); such efforts will reduce
   or even reverse the present epidemic of ESRD by the middle of the 21(st)
   Century. In the meantime, the number of ESRD patients will continue to
   increase and, unless xenotransplantation and cloning of one's own
   kidneys using stem cells will provide an alternative, the various modes
   of dialysis will continue to be the principle treatment for an
   increasing numbers of ESRD patients. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has
   achieved success at certain salient points and, to advance further, the
   next generation of nephrologists will have to build on these. They
   include the following: PD is the treatment of choice for children; it
   has low rates of peritonitis; it has similar (or in some countries,
   better) survival rates than hemodialysis; it has lower costs; it has
   adequate clearances through the introduction of automated PD; and it is
   an effective treatment for those awaiting a kidney transplant. This
   report presents the authors' views concerning the areas in which PD will
   improve in the future. These include (1) a reduction in technique
   failure rates that will allow us to maintain a larger number of patients
   on PD for 10 years or more; (2) prevention of long-term changes of the
   peritoneal membrane through the use of more ``friendly{''} solutions;
   (3) prevention of malnutrition; (4) the development of better peritoneal
   access devices; and (5) the increased use of PD as the treatment of
   first choice for most ESRD patients. (C) 2000 by the National Kidney

Abstract = {{The effect of additive bile salts on Peking ducks, fed barley-based
   diet, were studied. During the growing period (48 days) control and 45\%
   barley-based diets were isonitrogenous and isoenergetic. Additional bile
   salts content was 0.3\% in the 45\% barley-based diet. Performance
   traits, 3 alpha -hydroxy bile acid, VLDL, triglyceride and cholesterol
   concentration of the blood plasma were determined.
   The 3 alpha -hydroxy bile acid content in the plasma increased with age
   in table ducks. The highest activity of synthesis and reabsorption of
   bile acids was detected within the last two weeks in the case of female
   ducks. The 45\% bailey-based diet decreased the plasma 3 alpha -hydroxy
   bile acid concentration on the 21(st), 35(th) and 48(th) day of age in
   both sexes compared to control. It suggests that the soluble NSPs
   enriched barley reduces the reabsorption of bile acids, exerting an
   indirect negative effect on the entrrohepatic cycle in table duck. The
   additional 0.3\% bile salts increased the 3 alpha -hydroxy bile acid
   concentration of the blood plasma on the 21(st), 35(th) and 48(th) day
   of age in both sexes acid compensated the bile acid lowering effect of
   45\% barley in the diet.}},

Abstract = {{A dissociation between plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone
   (T) appears to exist during exposure to altered gravity. The pulsatile
   nature of LH release and the diurnal variability of T secretion may mask
   or bias the effects of altered gravity on the pituitary-gonadal axis
   when analyzing plasma concentrations. Therefore, we examined the
   relationship between the excretion of urinary LH and T in male
   Sprague-Dawley rats during exposure to increased gravity upon return to
   Earth following a 14-day spaceflight (n = 6) and by 12 days of
   centrifugation at 2g (n = 8), Excreted LH and T were elevated on the
   first 3 days postflight, Excreted T was elevated between Days 1 and 8 of
   centrifugation; however, excreted LH was reduced on Days 2 and 3
   compared with control animals. Excreted LH and T were significantly
   correlated (R = 0.731 and 0.706, respectively) in postspaceflight and
   centrifuged animals. Correlation curves had similar slopes (0.0213 and
   0.023, respectively), but different y-intercepts (-1.43 and 3.32,
   respectively), The sustained increase in excreted T during
   centrifugation suggests that the pituitary-gonadal axis in
   postspaceflight animals may adapt quicker to increased gravity, The
   upward shift in the correlation curve exhibited by the centrifuged
   animals suggests that the sensitivity of LH-induced T release is
   increased in these animals. The previous dissociation between plasma LH
   and T during altered gravity was not observed in the present study in
   which excreted LH and T were measured.}},

Abstract = {{We report a small, well-demarcated stromal tumor of the gallbladder in a
   69-year-old woman. The tumor and associated cholelithiasis led to
   chronic cholecystitis symptoms. The wall of the gallbladder contained a
   2.4-cm hypocellular nodule composed of bland spindle-shaped cells that
   were immunoreactive for vimentin. CD34, and CD117. With the latter
   antibody, which stains interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), the neoplastic
   cells appear fusiform with elongated bipolar projections or
   dendritic-like cytoplasmic projections. The gallbladder wall adjacent to
   the tumor contained numerous CD117-positive cells in close contact with
   the normal smooth muscle cells, whereas two of 10 gallbladders with
   minimal chronic cholecystitis showed only a few CD117-positive cells.
   These findings provide evidence that this stromal tumor of the
   gallbladder shows ICC differentiation similar to some stromal tumors of
   the gut. The presence of numerous ICC in the uninvolved gallbladder wall
   suggests that this tumor might have evolved through hyperplasia of ICC.}},

Abstract = {{To establish the diagnostic significance of canine C-reactive protein
   (CRP) in gastrointestinal disorders, the serum canine CRP concentration
   was measured in dogs with experimentally-induced acute gastric mucosal
   injury.
   Gastric injury was induced in one male and one female beagle by a single
   dose oral administration of acetylsalicylic acid (200 mg/kg body weight)
   or indomethacin (60 mg/kg body weight), or sodium chloride (1000 mg/kg
   body weight). CRP was measured prior to dose, and 1, 3, 7, and 14 days
   after the administration of the drugs, together with the total leucocyte
   counts and serum iron.
   Changes in the serum CRP in dogs with gastric injury were similar for
   the three test compounds, and reflected by the endoscopic findings. CRP
   values increased from 87 to 390 mg/l within 1 to 3 days after the
   compound administration but returned nearly to the predose levels within
   14 days. Endoscopy revealed haemorrhagic erosion of the gastric mucosa
   in all dogs one day after dosing, with no evidence of the erosions
   observed after 7 days in many of the dogs. Changes of the total
   leucocyte and serum iron also occurred following gastric injury, but
   these changes were not as marked as those observed for CRP.
   The results of this study suggest that serum CRP level may be a useful
   indicator of a gastrointestinal mucosal injury in dogs.}},

Abstract = {{Peripheral T cell lymphocytosis is a rare finding in association with
   malignant thymomas. In the majority of previous cases, the tumours have
   behaved aggressively with symptoms arising from local invasion. We
   describe a patient with ocular myasthenia gravis who presented with a
   rapidly progressive polymyositis and neuropathy and who was subsequently
   found to have a thymic mass and a mild T cell lymphocytosis. The thymoma
   did not give rise to local symptoms and showed no evidence of
   progression over a 14-month period of follow-up. The possibility of an
   underlying thymic tumour should be considered in any patient with
   chronic T cell lymphocytosis if the circulating cells show mature
   morphology and there is no molecular evidence of monoclonality.}},

Title = {{The role of adrenomedullin in varicocele and impotence}},
Journal = {{BJU INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{86}},

Pages = {{694-698}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective To assess the levels of adrenomedullin (a vasodilatory
   peptide) in penile blood before and after injection with papaverine in
   impotent men, and in the internal spermatic vein in infertile patients
   with varicocele, comparing the results with levels in the brachial vein
   in the same patients.
   Patients and methods Intracavernosal levels of adrenomedullin were
   determined in 14 impotent men (with no vascular pathology, as assessed
   by colour Doppler ultrasonography) before and after papaverine-induced
   penile erection. The effect of needle puncture alone was assessed in
   eight control patients. The level of adrenomedullin was also measured in
   the internal spermatic vein and brachial vein in 14 infertile men with
   varicocele.
   Results The mean (SD) intracavernosal adrenomedullin levels in the 14
   impotent men were significantly different between the flaccid and
   papaverine-induced erectile state, at 93.5 (33.0) and 135.8 (34.9)
   pmol/mL, respectively, (P < 0.05). Needle puncture alone had no effect
   on adrenomedullin levels. In men with varicocele, the adrenomedullin
   level of 139.0 (34.3) pmol/mL within the internal spermatic vein was
   significantly higher than that in the brachial vein, at 103.9 (37.6)
   pmol/mL (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion Injection with papaverine increases adrenomedullin release
   into penile blood; this release may be responsible for the increase in
   penile blood flow and penile erection. Higher levels of adrenomedullin
   within the internal spermatic vein of patients with varicocele may
   result from the retrograde flow of venous blood from the left adrenal
   gland and kidney. Further studies are needed to determine the role of
   adrenomedullin in male infertility and impotence.}},

Abstract = {{Objective, To characterize the association between the TNF alpha-308A
   allele and 1) duration of active disease, 2) peripheral blood
   mononuclear cell (PBMC) synthesis of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF
   alpha) in vitro, and 3) pathologic calcifications in patients with
   juvenile dermatomyositis (DM),
   Methods. The TNF alpha-308 alleles were determined by polymerase chain
   reaction in 37 white patients with juvenile DM and in 29 control
   subjects. Patients were grouped according to duration of
   immunosuppressive therapy: long (greater than or equal to 36 months) or
   short (<36 months). Unstimulated PBMC were examined by enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay for TNF alpha production in vitro. Sixty-five white
   patients with juvenile DM were examined for pathologic calcifications.
   Results. TNF alpha-308A was identified in 18 of 37 patients with
   juvenile DM, in contrast with 5 of 29 controls (P = 0.009). Sixteen of
   the 18 patients with juvenile DM who had the TNF alpha-308A allele had a
   disease course greater than or equal to 36 months, compared with 6 of 19
   patients with TNF alpha-308G (P = 0.001). PBMC from 16 of the 18
   juvenile DM patients with TNF alpha-308A synthesized more TNF alpha
   (median 53 pg/ml) compared with PBMC from 9 of 19 patients with TNF
   alpha-308G (median 19 pg/ml) (P = 0.007). Nineteen of 22 juvenile DM
   patients requiring therapy for greater than or equal to 36 months
   produced more TNF alpha (median 20.5 pg/ml) in comparison with 6 of 15
   juvenile DM patients with a <36-month treatment course (median TNF alpha
   0.0 pg/ml) (P = 0.005). Detectable calcifications were present in 3 of 8
   children with juvenile DM who had TNF alpha-308AA, compared with 2 of 21
   children with TNF alpha-308AG and 1 of 36 children who had TNF
   alpha-308GG (P = 0.017).
   Conclusion. A long course of juvenile DM and the presence of pathologic
   calcifications were associated with the TNF alpha-308A allele and with
   the increased production of TNF alpha, which may perpetuate the
   inflammatory response.}},

Abstract = {{Computer simulations using a geographical information system were
   developed to investigate the relationships between the habitat
   composition of red grouse territories and the alignment of territory
   boundaries in relation to vegetation patterns. Field data were from a
   fifteen year study on Kerloch Moor, north-east Scotland, between 1963
   and 1977.
   In order to determine whether observed territories were arranged
   randomly with respect to a number of habitat characteristics, they were
   compared with many simulated sets of possible territory arrangements by
   translation of the territory boundaries to a number of different
   positions relative to the vegetation mosaic. A suite of summary
   statistics was calculated for the simulated configurations, against
   which the observed configurations were rested.
   There was little evidence for territorial resource competition by red
   grouse. The positions of territories were not strongly influenced by
   their composition in terms of vegetation types or heather edge. Neither
   was there any obvious preference for territory boundaries to lie within
   particular vegetation types. However, there was clear evidence that
   physical features of the habitat (fences, wails, tracks, etc.) had a
   strong influence on the position of territory boundaries.
   Temporal and spatial habitat heterogeneity led to a number of technical
   and analytical problems, and the implications of these are discussed.}},

   Reliability was determined using a one-way repeated measures analysis of
   variance and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2,1).
   Results. Reliability of the 6-minute walk test was excellent both at
   program intake (ICC2,1 = 0.92) and program completion (ICC2,1 = 0.98).
   On program intake, significant differences (P < 0.01) were found between

Abstract = {{Increased nitrogen supply stimulates plant growth and photosynthesis.
   Since it was shown that heavy metals may cause deficiencies of essential
   nutrients in plants the potential reversal of cadmium toxicity by
   increased N nutrition was investigated. The effects on photosynthesis of
   low Cd (0, 0.5, 2 or 5 mmol m(-3)) combined with three N treatments (2,
   7.5 or 10 mol m(-3)) were examined in young sunflower plants.
   Chlorophyll fluorescence quenching parameters were determined at ambient
   CO2 and at 100 or 800 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1). The vitality index
   (R-fd) decreased approx. three-times in response to 5 mmol m(-3) Cd, at
   2 and 10 mol m(-3) N. The maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII
   reaction centres (F-v/F-m) was not influenced by Cd or N treatment. The
   highest Cd concentration decreased quantum efficiency of PSII electron
   transport (Phi(II)) by 30 \%, at 2 and 10 mol m(-3) N, mostly due to
   increased closure of PSII reaction centres (q(p)). Photosynthetic oxygen
   evolution rates at saturating CO2 were decreased in plants treated with
   5 mmol m(-3) Cd, at all N concentrations. The results indicate that Cd
   treatment affected the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration
   capacity of the Calvin cycle more than other processes. At the same
   time, the amounts of soluble and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
   carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) protein increased with Cd treatment.
   Decreased photosynthesis, but substantially increased Rubisco content,
   in sunflower leaves under Cd stress indicate that a significant amount
   of Rubisco protein is not active in photosynthesis and could have
   another function. It is shown that optimal nitrogen nutrition decreases
   the inhibitory effects of Cd in young sunflower plants. (C) 2000 Annals

Abstract = {{A high-calcium flyash (FH, 23\% total CaO-5\% free CaO), with high SO3
   content (4.3\%), was studied as additive in mortar, replacing part of
   the volume either of Portland cement or aggregate. The development of
   the strength, porosity, bound water, and calcium hydroxide content was
   measured. When this fly ash replaces aggregate, significantly higher
   strengths were observed from the beginning of the hydration, as well as
   higher water binding and significantly lower porosity. In the case of
   cement replacement, the strength remained constant. A simplified scheme
   describing the chemical reactions of the FH in hydrating Portland cement
   is proposed and applied to develop mathematical expressions for reaction
   products and porosity estimation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The accuracy of the moment method of log-normal size distribution for
   aerosol coagulation problem was investigated. The constant collision
   kernel coagulation problem was solved by the moment method as well as a
   very accurate numerical method (Landgrebe and Pratsinis, 1990) for the
   purpose. Approximate analytical solutions to the problem by different
   choices of moments were obtained and compared with the result of the
   accurate numerical model. During the analysis, solutions to the moments
   of the size distribution were obtained in exact form and it was
   discussed that the solutions can be used as a standard reference for
   ensuring the accuracy of any new numerical schemes for solving the
   coagulation equation. The time evolution of the particle size
   distribution was obtained by representing the size distribution with a
   log-normal size distribution function. Depending on the choice for three
   moments during the analysis, different solutions to the size
   distribution parameters were obtained. Three choices for moments were
   compared as an example. The use of the 0(th), 1(st) and 2(nd) moments
   which has been conventionally used was proven to be most accurate for
   various polydispersity cases by comparing with a numerical result and is
   recommended to be used for future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Starting from (+)- and (-)-perillyl alcohols, via Claisen rearrangement

   beetle (Sitophilus granarius L.), the khapra beetle (Trogoderma
   granarium Ev.), and the confused flour beetle (Tribolium confusum Duv.).
   The results of the tests proved that two compounds, (1R,4R,6R)-(-)-4-(
   1-methylethenyl)-9-oxabicyclo{[}4.3.0]nonan-8-one (8a) and its
   enantiomer (8b), are very active antifeedants against all of the above
   tested species. The lactone 8b is also active against the peach-potato
   aphid (Myzus persicae Suit.). The activity depends on the absolute
   configurations of compound chiral centers. Additionally, the lactones 8a
   and 8b are characterized by interesting fragrances.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cereals are the most important nutritional component in the
   human diet. Food-induced allergic reactions to these substances
   therefore have serious implications, and exhaustive diagnosis Is
   required. Such diagnosis is still difficult because of the incomplete
   knowledge about major cereal allergens. In particular, few food-induced
   allergic reactions to maize have been reported, and no information on
   the allergenic proteins is available.
   Objective: Having observed several anaphylactic reactions to maize, we
   planned a study to identify maize major allergens and cross-reactivity
   with other cereals, as well as to peach because the majority of patients
   also reacted to Prunoideae fruits.
   Methods: Twenty-two patients with systemic symptoms after maize
   ingestion and positive skin prick test responses and serum-specific IgE
   antibodies to maize were selected. The IgE-reactivity pattern was
   identified by SDS-PACE and immunoblotting. The major allergen identified
   was then purified by HPLC and characterized by mass spectrometry,
   determination of the isoelectric point value, and N-terminal amino acid
   sequencing.
   Results: Sera from 19 (86\%) of the 22 patients recognized a 9-kd
   protein, thus confirming this as the maize major allergen. This protein
   had an isoelectric point of greater than 9, a molecular mass of 9047.0
   d, and no glycosylation. Determination of its N-terminal sequence showed
   that it was a lipid transfer protein (LTP). By using
   immunoblotting-inhibition experiments, we demonstrated that the LTP
   cross-reacts completely with rice and peach LTPs but not with wheat or
   barley LTPs. N-terminal sequence of the 16-kd allergen (recognized by
   36\% of patients) showed it to be the maize inhibitor of trypsin, This
   protein cross-reacts completely with grass, wheat, barley, and rice
   trypsin inhibitors.
   Conclusion: The major allergen of maize is an LTP with a molecular
   weight of 9 kd that is highly homologous with the peach LTP, the major
   allergen of the Prunoideae subfamily.}},

Abstract = {{The iceA locus of Helicobacter pylori includes one of two mutually
   exclusive gene families, ice,ll and iceA2. Colonization with iceA1
   strains is associated with enhanced acute mucosal inflammation, and
   adherence to gastric epithelial cells in vitro induces expression of
   iceA1 but not iceA2 mRNA; however, both transcripts can be detected in
   vivo. The aim of this study was to determine whether differing levels of
   iceA transcription in vivo may contribute to disease pathogenesis. RNA
   from II H. pylori-positive gastric biopsy specimens was reverse
   transcribed to cDNA. Quantitative PCR was performed using biotinylated
   iceA1, iceA2, and 16S rRNA primers, and binding of biotinylated products
   to streptavidin-coated plates was detected by hybridization with a
   fluorescein-labeled probe, iceA genotypes were determined by PCR and
   sequence analysis. All 41 samples contained detectable H. pylori 16S
   rRNA, with similar levels in iceA1- (n = 10) and iceA2 (n =
   31)-colonized patients (P = 0.34). Biopsy specimens from four (40\%) and
   19 (61\%) persons colonized with iceA1 or iceA2 strains, respectively,
   had detectable iceA RNA. Acute inflammatory scores were significantly
   higher in iceA1 RNA-positive patients than in iceA1 RNA-negative, iceA2
   RNA-positive, or iceA2 RNA-negative subjects (P less than or equal to
   0.05 for each). Within the iceA2 RNA-positive group, H. pylori strains
   with a single 35-amino-acid cassette were associated with significantly
   higher mucosal iceA2 transcript levels (P = 0.014 versus strains with
   two cassettes). These results indicate that the levels of transcription
   of H. pylori iceA1 and iceA2 and of 16S rRNA are independent and that
   particular iceA2 gene structures are associated with enhanced
   transcription. The finding that iceA1 transcription levels are
   significantly associated with the intensity of neutrophilic infiltration
   suggests that heterogeneity in inflammatory scores among persons
   colonized with H. pylori iceA1 strains reflects levels of iceA1
   transcription in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Trace fossils represent both sedimentological and paleontological
   entities, representing a unique blending of potential environmental
   indicators in the rock record. Trace fossils and trace fossil suites can
   be employed effectively to aid in the recognition of various
   discontinuity types and to assist in their genetic interpretation.
   Ichnology may be employed to resolve surfaces of stratigraphic
   significance in two main ways: 1) through the identification of
   discontinuities using substrate-controlled ichnofacies, and 2) through
   careful analysis of vertical softground (penecontemporaneous) ichnologic
   successions (analogous to facies successions). Ichnological analysis is
   a valuable tool in genetic stratigraphic studies. Integrating the data
   derived from substrate-controlled ichnofacies with paleoecological data
   from vertical ichnologic successions greatly enhances the recognition
   and interpretation of a wide variety of stratigraphic surfaces. When
   this is coupled with conventional facies analysis and sequence
   stratigraphy, a powerful approach to the interpretation of the rock
   record is generated.}},

Abstract = {{Spherical hydrogels were prepared by precipitation copolymerization of
   N-vinylcaprolactam and sodium acrylate {[}P(VCL-co-NaA)] at 60 degreesC.
   As a thermally sensitive polymer, the increase of temperature in the
   range 25-40 degreesC can lead to a continuous shrinking of PVCL
   homopolymer chains. The copolymerization of a few molar percent of NaA.
   into a PVCL chain increases its swelling extent and shifts its shrinking
   temperature slightly higher. Our results revealed that in the shrinking
   process, calcium ions (Ca2+) induced a profound complexation of the
   P(VCL-co-NaA) microgels at a critical temperature (T-c) which was nearly
   independent of the NaA content. However, both the rate and degree of the
   complexation increase as the NaA content increases at T-c. One the basis
   of this study, we further studied the complexation of P(VCL-co-NaA)
   microgels with gelatin in the presence of calcium ions and prepared
   chemically crosslinked of the gelatin gels with embedded P(VCL-co-NaA)
   microgels. Our results showed that the shrinking of the embedded

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To review trends and current practices in delivery of medical
   care at home.
   Quality OF EVIDENCE A MEDLINE search from January 1989 to March 2000
   yielded 65 articles. Most articles are descriptive; analytical studies
   are rare.
   MAIN MESSAGE The number of home visits made by physicians has
   consistently declined in the last 30 years. The most common reasons
   cited are lack of efficiency, the time required, and poor reimbursement.
   Home visits, reserved mainly for frail elderly people and palliative
   patients, are seen as valuable for preventing unnecessary visits to
   emergency rooms and hospitalizations. Home visits are also useful for
   reducing caregivers' stress, monitoring chronic illnesses, and assessing
   need for institutionalization. Home visiting requires special skills;
   these must be taught to current trainees.
   CONCLUSION With die shift to more community-based care, the demand for
   physicians to make home visits will increase. Physicians must be
   adequately prepared to deliver home care and be reimbursed
   appropriately.}},

Abstract = {{To analyze the contribution of MHC class II genes in type 2 diabetes
   mellitus (DM) with end stage renal disease (ESRD), we examined the
   distribution of HLA-DRB1, DQA1, DQB1 loci in Mexican Mestizos of General
   Mexico, using PCR-SSOP and PCR-SSP. Three groups were included: 47 type
   2 diabetic ESRD patients; 42 patients with ESRD and 50 type 2 DM
   patients with no kidney complication. The results were compared with
   those of 101 controls of the same area. The median since DM was first
   diagnosed, was 18 years prior to the onset of ESRD, The frequencies of
   DRB1{*}1502 and DQB1{*}0501 were increased in DM patients with ESRD (p =
   0.004; RR = 7.4, CI = 1.5-37; EF = 0.13; P = 0.007; RR = 2.9, CI =
   2.3-3.5, EF = 0.21, respectively). In contrast, DRB1{*}0407 was
   decreased in the same group VI = 0.0008 RR = 0.2; CI = 0.035-0.70 PF =
   0.19). Diabetic patients with DRB1{*}1502 are 8.8 times more likely to
   develop ESRD, independently of the duration time of DM. DRB1{*}1502
   contributes to the susceptibility to ESRD while DRB1{*}0407 is involved
   in protect ion. The residue at DRB1-74 differs in these alleles:
   DRB1{*}0407 has glutamic acid and DRB1{*}1502 has an alanine, suggesting

Abstract = {{The effect of contest and scramble competition on the growth performance
   of wild and sea-ranched juvenile (0+) brown trout, Salmo trutta,
   originating from the River Dalalven, Sweden was scrutinised. In a mirror
   image stimulation (MIS) experiment, and in a 35 000 1 stream-water
   aquarium the trout was studied for three weeks (20 individuals in each
   of four replicates). Activity in MIS was correlated with swimming
   activity in the stream-water aquarium. The MIS results could not be used
   for predicting any social behaviour patterns or the growth performance
   of a fish. No behavioural differences between the two strains were
   noted. However, the sea-ranched strain grew faster than the wild one,
   both in regard to the RNA/DNA ratio and the weight-specific growth rate.
   Because the strains had the same genetic background and prior to the
   experiments were raised under similar hatchery condition, the results of
   this study suggest that the sea-ranching process selects for faster
   juvenile growth in brown trout. The ultimate mechanisms underlying the
   faster growth by the domesticated strain probably involves both contest
   and scramble competition.}},

Abstract = {{Functional neuroimaging in human subjects and studies of monkeys with
   lesions limited to the mid-dorsolateral (MDL) prefrontal cortex have
   shown that this specific region of the prefrontal cortex is involved in
   visual working memory, although its precise role remains a matter of
   debate. The present study compared the effect on visual working memory
   of lesions restricted to the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the
   monkey with that of lesions to the anterior inferotemporal cortex, a
   region of the temporal cortex specialized for visual memory. Increasing
   the delay during which information had to be maintained in visual
   working memory impaired performance after lesions of the anterior
   inferotemporal cortex, but not after mid-dorsolateral prefrontal
   lesions. By contrast, increasing the number of stimuli that had to be
   monitored impaired the performance of animals with mid-dorsolateral
   prefrontal lesions, but not that of animals with anterior inferotemporal
   lesions. This demonstration of a double dissociation between the effects
   of these two lesions provides strong evidence that the role of the
   mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in visual working memory does not lie
   in the maintenance of information per se, but rather in the executive
   process of monitoring this information. In addition, the present study
   demonstrated that lesions limited to area 9, which constitutes the
   superior part of the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal region, give rise to a
   mild impairment in the monitoring of information, whereas lesions of the
   complete mid-dorsolateral prefrontal region yield a very severe
   impairment.}},

Abstract = {{New data on the structural setting of the Torino Hill and Western
   Monferrato domains provide a clearer picture of the kinematic evolution
   of the Alps-Apennines junction zone. In the Alps-Apennines junction,
   left-lateral underthrusting of Ligurian units below Alpine crust has
   often been invoked to explain the underthrusting of the Insubric domain
   and the NW-ward movement of the Adriatic indenter. A transpressive fault
   system (Rio Freddo Fault Zone) developed in the Monferrato epi-ligurian
   succession is here understood as the surficial expression of a
   deep-seated thrust along which the Alpine metamorphic basement of the
   Torino Hill has overridden the Apenninic Ligurian nappes since the
   Paleogene up to Burdigalian. In the Western Monferrato the regional
   sinistral transpression differentiated separated crustal blocks during
   the Oligocene-early Miocene, and kilometer-thick successions were
   steepened by NNW-SSE faults that acted as reverse and/or left-lateral
   faults. Double-vergent (SE-NW) law-angle sheer zones then cut the Rio
   Freddo Fault Zone in post-Langhian times. They have been here related
   with the eastward tectonic transport of the Torino Hill and relative
   Alpine crust toward the Monferrato domain, which occurred before the
   seismic line scale middle Miocene unconformity was established. This po
   ses the problem of the exact age of this regional unconformity, which in
   our case should be at least Serravallian. Finally, the Monferrato and
   Torino Hill domains were coupled, and both were NW-ward translated by
   the Padan Thrust Front in the Pliocene. The youngest strike-slip and
   reverse faults of the Western Monferrato may be tear or compartmental
   faults that partitioned the Padan Thrust motion, whose propagation could
   be controlled by pre-middle-Miocene tectonic structures. The structural
   complexity of the study area is here understood as the inheritance of
   deep crosscutting regional structures that forced the convergent
   structural units of the Alpine and Insubric domains to follow different
   tectonic transport directions since the Oligocene.}},

Abstract = {{We present CCD BVI observations obtained for stars in the fields of the
   unstudied or poorly studied open clusters Ruprecht 119, NGC 6318, and BH
   245 projected close to the direction towards the Galactic centre. We
   measured V magnitude and B - V and V - I colours for about 600 stars
   reaching down to V similar to 19 mag. From the analysis of the colour
   magnitude diagrams, we confirmed the physical reality of the clusters
   and derived their reddening, distance and age for the first time. In
   addition, we obtained flux-calibrated integrated spectra in the range
   3500-9200 Angstrom for the cluster sample. Using the equivalent widths
   of the Balmer lines and comparing the cluster spectra with template
   spectra we derive both foreground reddening and age. The photometric and
   spectroscopic results reveal that the three studied objects are very
   young open clusters with ages ranging between 10 and 15 Myr, which have
   already undergone the HII region evolutionary phase and are dominated by
   the upper MS stars. The clusters, located between 1.1 kpc and 3.3 kpc
   from the Sun, are affected by different amounts of interstellar visual
   absorption (2.4 less than or equal to A(v) less than or equal to 7.0).
   In particular, BH 245 turned out to be a highly reddened open cluster
   located at a distance of scarcely 1.1 kpc.}},

Abstract = {{It is possible that preterm delivery is not a single entity but a
   cluster of conditions with different aetiologies that ultimately result
   in the delivery of an infant before 37 completed weeks of gestation.
   Whereas some researchers have reported aetiological heterogeneity,
   others have found no differences between subtypes or have disputed the
   desirability and utility of classifying preterm birth into subtypes.
   This study explores the relationship of maternal risk factors to type of
   preterm delivery in a cohort of over 7000 black and white women
   delivering singleton infants at the University of California, San
   Francisco's Moffitt Hospital between 1980 and 1990. Although the
   magnitude of the effect of individual risk factors differed between
   preterm delivery subtypes, the set of risk factors significantly
   associated with both categories of spontaneous preterm delivery was
   identical, while that associated with medically indicated preterm births
   was different. This study indicates that whereas the distinction between
   spontaneous preterm deliveries and those that are medically indicated
   seems valid, distinguishing between types of spontaneous preterm births
   may not lead to useful aetiological inferences.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine whether exposure of the
   isolated, perfused human placental cotyledon to different fetal circuit
   perfusion rates, and to concomitant pressure differences, alters
   placental production of interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha.
   STUDY DESIGN: The maternal and fetal circulations of 2 cotyledons from 5
   placentas were perfused for 4 hours. The fetal circulation of 1
   cotyledon was perfused at a low rate of 1 mL/min, and the other at a
   high rate of 10 mL/min. The maternal circulation of each cotyledon was
   perfused at 10 mL/min. Effluents from the fetal circulation were
   collected at hourly intervals, and concentrations of interleukin 6 and
   tumor necrosis factor alpha were determined by enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay. Concentrations of interleukin 6, obtained from a
   prior study with an estimated physiologic fetal circulation rate of 4
   mL/min, were compared with the low and high perfusion rate results.
   RESULTS: Concentrations of interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha
   were greater at the perfusion rate of 1 mL/min, in comparison with the
   perfusion rate of 10 mL/min, with statistically significant differences
   achieved at 2 and 4 hours for interleukin 6 and at 4 hours for tumor
   necrosis factor alpha. Concentrations of both cytokines increased
   exponentially with time. Placental perfusion pressures were
   significantly greater at the perfusion rate of 10 mL/min.
   CONCLUSION: Placental hypoperfusion results in an increased production
   of both interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. This finding
   links placental perfusion abnormalities to the myriad of disorders
   associated with elevated concentrations of inflammatory cytokines,
   including cerebral palsy.}},

Abstract = {{The specific heat of polycrystalline CePb3 was measured in magnetic
   fields to 14 T and temperatures down to 0.4 K. An anomaly related to an
   aniferromagnetic phase transition is effectively attenuated by magnetic
   fields and disappears for fields larger than 6 T. The electronic
   specific heat coefficient gamma increases for small fields, has a
   maximum value at 6 T, and decreases for larger fields. This field
   dependence of y correlates with previously studied quadratic temperature
   coefficient of the resistivity as a function of a magnetic field.
   A/gamma(2) is field dependent below 6 T, but constant (similar to 10(-5)
   Ohm cm K-2 mol(2) J(-2)) for fields larger than 6 T within the
   experimental uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Due to inter-operator variability, two operators were used to assess the
   consistency of motor unit (MU) identification during ramp contractions,
   by the comparison of semi-automatic decompositions of the same
   recordings. Static shoulder abduction was performed against a force
   transducer in a position with the upper arms vertical and elbows flexed
   to 90 degrees. The subjects followed an 8-s force trajectory: 30\%
   maximum voluntary contraction (MVC, 2 s), a reduction in force from 30\%
   to 0\% MVC (2 s), 0\% MVC(1 s), an increase in force from 0 to 30\% MVC
   (2 s), and 30\% MVC(I s). Muscle activity was recorded from the
   supraspinatus muscle with a quadripolar needle. From six recordings of 8
   s duration, a total of 2527 MU firings were identified by both
   operators, and 93\% of these were identified identically into 31 MUs.
   Both operators identified 8 of these MUs as continuously firing, 5 as
   only bring active either before or after the 1 s at 0\% MVC, and 18 as
   being de-recruited during force decreases and recruited during force
   increases. Both operators agreed that 16 of these 18 MUs were
   de-recruited at a higher force level than that at which they were
   recruited, which may be due to the electromechanical delay. The
   coefficient of variation for double determination of the results
   obtained by operators A and B was 8.5\% for the number of MU firings,
   4.5\% for the MU mean firing rate, and 8.4\% for the MU action potential
   (MUAP) amplitude. Therefore, the operator interactive decomposition
   method was considered to be valid for studying recruitment and
   de-recruitment as well as firing rate and MUAP amplitude during static,
   force-varying ramp contractions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: To examine the relationship between respiratory regulation
   and childhood anxiety disorders, this study considered the relationship
   between anxiety disorders and symptoms during carbon dioxide (CO2)
   exposure, CO2 sensitivity in specific childhood anxiety disorders, and
   the relationship between symptomatic and physiological. responses to
   CO2.
   Methods: Following procedures established in adults, 104 children (aged
   9-17 years), including 25 from a previous study, underwent 5\% CO2
   inhalation. The sample included 57 probands with an anxiety disorder
   (social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety
   disorder, and panic disorder) and 47 nonill comparison subjects.
   Symptoms of anxiety were assessed before, during, and after CO2
   inhalation.
   Results: All children tolerated the procedure well, experiencing
   transient or no increases in anxiety symptoms. Children with an anxiety
   disorder, particularly separation anxiety disorder, exhibited greater
   changes in somatic symptoms during inhalation of CO2-enriched air,
   relative to the comparison group. During CO2 inhalation, symptom ratings
   were positively correlated with respiratory rate increases, as well as
   with levels of tidal volume, minute ventilation, end-tidal CO2, and
   irregularity in respiratory rate during room-air breathing.
   Conclusions: Childhood anxiety disorders, particularly separation
   anxiety disorder, are associated with CO2 hypersensitivity, as defined
   by symptom reports. Carbon dioxide hypersensitivity is associated with
   physiological changes similar to those found in panic disorder. These
   and other data suggest that certain childhood anxiety disorders may
   share pathophysiological features with adult panic disorder.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is concerned both with forests plantation for the production
   of industrial round wood and fiscal and other government incentives
   supporting forest plantation establishment. It also discusses some key
   characteristics of a forest plantation investment as opposed to other
   forms of investments. It begins by tracing the development of the forest
   resources in Sabah and the forest depletion that has taken place
   necessitating the establishment of forest plantations. Even though
   forest plantations can never supply the range of goods and environmental
   services that the natural forests can provide, the creation of such
   plantations can contribute towards the wise management of the remaining
   natural forests by supplementing and complementing round wood supplies.
   The Sabah State Government has promoted forest plantation since the
   early 70s by making available land with a sufficient lease period.
   However, it is noted that the current investment incentives provided for
   are not attractive enough for big investors to participate. Unless a
   definite tax incentive is provided for, like a group relief tax
   allowance, Malaysia might in future have to import timber from other
   countries.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of asthma remains difficult to determine with precision
   with no absolute or ``gold{''} standard for diagnosis. A recently
   developed video questionnaire for epidemiological studies with less
   reliance on understanding written questions provides another tool for
   determining prevalence and severity of asthma. This report from the
   International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC)
   examines the agreement between the ISAAC video questionnaires on
   respiratory symptoms and reported asthma. Between December 1993 and
   April 1995, 4952 children aged 13-14 years in two Canadian communities
   completed sequentially the ISAAC written and video questionnaires at
   school. The agreement between responses to the two questionnaires for
   reported wheeze ever, current wheeze, wheeze on exercise, and nocturnal
   wheeze (the latter three questions relating to symptoms in the last 12
   months), and to any combination of the latter three questions was
   examined in the full sample and in those reporting diagnosed asthma,
   using concordance and kappa coefficients as measures of agreement.
   The prevalences of wheeze ever, current wheeze, wheeze on exercise, and
   nocturnal wheeze were significantly lower based on responses to the
   video questionnaire compared with the written questionnaire in both
   regions in the full sample and in those labeled as having asthma.
   Although concordance between video and written questionnaires always
   exceeded 60\% and often exceeded 70\% for related questions, agreement
   measured by the kappa statistic for each question was only fair to
   moderate (kappa = 0.22-0.51).
   We conclude that the video questionnaire yields lower reported
   prevalence rates for asthma symptoms, and that there is limited
   agreement between responses to the two questionnaires that is not
   explained by issues of language, culture, or literacy. Pediatr Pulmonol,

Abstract = {{Maternal low protein malnutrition during gestation and lactation (LP) is
   an animal model frequently used for the investigation of long-term
   deleterious consequences of perinatal growth retardation. Both perinatal
   malnutrition and growth retardation at birth are risk factors for
   diabetic and cardiovascular disturbances in later life. The
   pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible are unknown. Hypothalamic nuclei
   are decisively involved in the central nervous regulation of food
   intake, body weight and metabolism, We investigated effects of a low
   protein diet (8\% protein; control diet, 17\% protein) during gestation
   and lactation in rat dams on the organization of hypothalamic regulators
   of body weight and metabolism in the offspring at weaning (d 20 of
   life), LP offspring had significantly lower body weight than control
   offspring (CO; P < 0.001), associated with hypoglycemia and
   hypoinsulinemia (P < 0.005) on d 20 of life. This was accompanied by a
   greater relative volume of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (P <
   0.01) and a greater numerical density of Nissl-stained neurons in this
   nucleus (P < 0.01) as well as in the paraventricular hypothalamic
   nucleus (PVN; P < 0.001). In contrast, no significant differences in
   neuronal densities were observed generally in the lateral hypothalamic
   area, arcuate hypothalamic nucleus (ARC), and dorsomedial hypothalamic
   nucleus between LP offspring and CO offspring. On the other hand, LP
   offspring displayed fewer neurons immunopositive for neuropeptide Y in
   the ARC (P < 0.05), whereas in the PVN, lower neuronal densities of
   neurons immunopositive for galanin were found in LP offspring compared
   with CO offspring (P < 0.001). On the contrary, in the PVN, no
   significant group difference in the numerical density of
   cholecystokinin-8S-positive neurons was present. A long-term effect of
   these specific hypothalamic alterations on body weight and metabolism in
   LP offspring during later life is suggested.}},

   (c) What are the results of meta-analysis? Twenty-one relevant studies

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional structure of duodenase, a serine protease from
   bovine duodenum mucosa, has been determined at 2.4 Angstrom resolution.
   The enzyme, which has both trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like
   activities, most closely resembles human cathepsin G with which it
   shares 57\% sequence identity and similar specificity. The catalytic
   Ser195 in duodenase adopts the energetically favored conformation
   typical of serine proteinases and unlike the strained state typical of
   lipase/ esterases. Of several meters in the active site of duodenase,
   the one associated with Ser214 is found in all serine proteinases and
   most lipase/esterases. The conservation of the Ser214 residue in serine
   proteinase, its presence in the active site, and participation in a
   hydrogen wafer network involving the catalytic triad (His57, Asp107, and
   Ser195) argues for its having an important role in the mechanism of
   action. It may be referred to as a fourth member of the catalJrtic
   triad. Duodenase is one of a growing family of enzymes that possesses
   trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like activity. Not long ago, these
   activities were considered to be mutually exclusive. Computer modeling
   reveals that the S1 subsite of duodenase has structural features
   compatible with effective accommodation of P1 residues typical of
   trypsin (Arg/Lys) and chymotrypsin (Tyr/Phe) substrates. The
   determination of structural features associated with functional
   variation in the enzyme family may permit design of enzymes with a
   specific ratio of trypsin and chymotrypsin activities. Proteins

Volume = {{42}},

Pages = {{167-174}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A quantitative method for the study of iron sulfides precipitated in
   liquid cultures of bacteria is described. This method can be used to
   quantify and discriminate among amorphous iron sulfide (FeSamorph), iron
   monosulfide minerals such as mackinawite or greigite (FeSmin), and iron
   disulfide minerals such as pyrite or marcasite (FeS2min) formed in
   liquid cultures. Degradation of iron sulfides is performed using a
   modified Cr2+ reduction method with reflux distillation. The basic steps
   of the method are: first, separation of FeSamorph; second, elimination
   of interfering species of S such as colloidal sulfur (S-c(o)),
   thiosulphate (S2O32-) and polysulfides (S-x(2-)); third, separation of
   FeSmin; and fourth, separation of FeS2min. The final product is H2S
   which is determined after trapping. The efficiency of recovery is
   96-99\% for FeSamorph, 76-88\% for FeSmin, and > 97\% for FeS2min. This
   method has a high reproducibility if the experimental conditions are
   rigorously applied and only glass conduits are used. A well ventilated
   fume hood must be used because of the toxicity and volatility of several
   reagents and products. The advantage relative to previously described
   methods are better resolution for iron sulfide species and use of the
   same bottles for both incubation of cultures and acid degradation. The
   method can also be used for Fe/S stoichiometry with sub-sampling and Fe
   analysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To evaluate the effectiveness of medical therapy during
   watchful waiting in patients with distal ureter stones.
   Methods. Ninety-six patients with radiopaque stones located in the
   distal tract of the ureter and with stone sizes of 1 cm or smaller were
   involved in the study. The patients were randomly divided into two
   groups. Group A (n = 48) received oral treatment with 30 mg of
   deflazacort daily (maximum 10 days) plus 30 mg of slow-release
   nifedipine daily (maximum 4 weeks). Group B (n = 48) underwent a
   wait-and-watch approach. Both groups of patients were allowed to use
   diclofenac on demand. Statistical analyses were carried out using
   Student's t test, the chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test.
   Results. The average stone size was 5.8 +/- 1.8 mm for group A and 5.5
   +/- 1.4 mm for group B. No statistically significant difference was
   found in stone size. Stone expulsion was observed in 38 (79\%) of 48
   patients in group A and in 17 (35\%) of 48 patients in group B. The
   average expulsion time was 7 days (range 2 to 10) for group A and 20
   days (range 10 to 28) for group B. A statistically significant
   difference was observed in both the expulsion rate and the expulsion
   time (P <0.05). The mean amount of sodium diclofenac used was 15 mg per
   patient for group A and 105 mg per patient for group B (P <0.05).
   Conclusions. The medical treatment proved to be effective and safe, as
   demonstrated by the increased stone expulsion rate, decreased expulsion
   time, and reduced need for analgesic therapy. UROLOGY 56: 579-583, 2000.

Abstract = {{Synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2) is a glycoprotein identified in the
   nervous system of several species, including man, but its occurrence in
   the human neuroendocrine (NE) cell system has not been investigated, By
   using a monoclonal antibody to SV2, immunoreactivities were demonstrated
   in NE cell types in human gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, anterior
   pituitary gland, thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal medulla, and also in
   chief cells of gastric oxyntic mucosa Immunoelectron microscopy of
   pancreatic islets revealed SV2 Immunoreactivity in secretory granules.
   Comparison of SV2, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A immunoreactivity
   showed more SV2- and synaptophysin- than chromogranin A-immunoreactive
   cells in the antrum and pancreas. In the other gastrointestinal regions
   and in the other endocrine organs more SV2- than
   synaptophysin-immunoreactive cells were seen. More chromogranin A- than
   SV2-immunoreactive cells were observed in duodenum, colon, and
   parathyroid, Various NE tumors were examined and all contained
   SV2-immunoreactive cells. The staining patterns with the three markers
   agreed well, except in hindgut carcinoids, which showed strong SV2
   Immunoreactivity, weak synaptophysin but no chromogranin A
   immunostaining. In pituitary adenomas more cells mere immunoreactive to
   SV2 than to the other two antibodies. In conclusion, SV2 is recognized
   as a further broad marker for NE cells and widens the arsenal of
   diagnostic tools for NE tumors. It is of special importance for
   identifying hindgut carcinoids.}},

Abstract = {{Historians' perceptions of the significance of the South African War
   (1899-1902) have changed considerably over a century. For a long time,
   its military magnitude, its importance in shaping a global capitalist
   system, and the stimulus it provided to theoretical understanding of
   imperialism, were felt to give the war an important role in the making
   of the modem world. Recent perspectives, both fed by and represented in
   the centenary commemorations, have replaced these grand sweeps with
   attention to the many and detailed South African wars experienced at
   first hand by different individuals and segments of Britain's and South
   Africa's populations. There is a case for suggesting that the place of
   the war in Britain's broader domestic and imperial history is now-and
   perhaps rightly-neglected, in part as a consequence of the fragmentation
   encouraged by historiographical specialization and also because an
   exaggerated importance was attributed to it for so long.}},

Abstract = {{Study objectives: To compare sublingual tissue PCO2, a disarmingly
   simple and noninvasive measurement of the severity of perfusion failure,
   with gastric tonometric PCO2 during hemorrhagic shock in five male
   domestic pigs weighing between 35 and 40 kg.
   Design: Prospective animal study.
   Setting: Animal laboratory in a research institution.
   Participants: Domestic pigs.
   Interventions: Hemorrhagic shock was induced by a modification of the
   Wigger's method, BP was maintained at 50 mm Hg for 120 min followed by
   reinfusion of shed blood at a rate of 100 mL/min with the aid of an
   infusion pump.
   Measurements and results: During bleeding, the mean arterial pressure
   decreased from an average of 127 to 42 mm Hg, and cardiac output
   decreased from 7.7 to 2.4 L/min. Arterial blood lactate concentration
   concurrently increased from 1.2 to 13.9 mmol/L, Sublingual PCO2
   (PslCO(2)) increased from 59 to 105 nun Hg, and gastric PCO2 increased
   from 61 to 111 mm Hg. The correlation between time-coincident sublingual
   and gastric measurements of PCO2 was r = 0.91 (p < 0.0001), Bland-Altman
   analyses demonstrated a close correspondence between the two
   measurements. The reinfusion of shed blood promptly reversed the
   hemodynamic abnormalities and reestablished gastric and PslCO(2) to near
   baseline values. This contrasted with a delayed reversal of lactic
   acidosis.
   Conclusions: Under experimental conditions of hemorrhagic shock,
   sublingual capnometry yielded measurements that were interchangeable
   with those of gastric tonometry.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the experimental demonstration of a novel wakefield
   acceleration technique where a short electron bunch excites a broadband
   harmonic frequency spectrum, in a cylindrical dielectric structure, to
   synthesize an accelerating waveform. The structure is designed to have
   its TM0n modes nearly equally spaced so that the modes generated by a
   single short electron bunch constructively interfere in the neighborhood
   of integral multiples of the fundamental wavelength producing large
   acceleration gradients. Realization of a harmonic multimode structure
   requires more stringent design considerations than a single-mode
   structure, since the permittivity and loss tangent of the material
   should not change substantially over the bandwidth of the structure. In
   this experiment, a bunch train of four 5 nC electron bunches, separated
   by 760 ps (one net wavelength), were passed through a 60 cm long
   dielectric-lined cylindrical harmonic structure. Use of a train of drive
   bunches spaced by one wavelength reinforced the accelerating wakefield;
   observation of the energy loss of each bunch via a magnetic spectrometer
   served as a diagnostic of the wakefield. The measured energy spectrum of
   the four beams after passing through the waveguide was found to be in
   excellent agreement with the predictions of the analytic model. This
   result demonstrates that a dielectric can be fabricated which can
   synthesize the required wakefield. We also discuss potential advantages
   of this harmonic approach over conventional single-mode wakefield
   accelerators.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{150}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{65-75}},

Abstract = {{Microbiotic crusts are a common and widespread feature of arid and
   semi-arid landscapes. Their effect on vascular plant success has been
   discussed controversially. However, only very few field studies have yet
   tried to experimentally investigate the effect of microbiotic crusts on
   vascular plant establishment.
   In this study we investigate the influence of cyanobacteria dominated
   microbiotic soil surface crust on vascular plants in a desert sand dune
   area by using a series of manipulative experiments. Crusts were
   disturbed and removed and density response to these treatments was
   monitored during the two following years.
   Emergence densities of vascular plants were considerably higher when
   crusts were removed and destroyed. This effect was particularly
   pronounced when the disturbances were applied before the main seed
   dispersal period. By experimentally preventing seed dispersal into
   disturbed areas we could show that undisturbed crusts reduce the
   probability for seeds to come to rest. This indicates that soil surface
   roughness is a major determinant for the establishment of vascular
   plants in the study area. We conclude that small-scale and well-timed
   disturbances of microbiotic crusts in arid lands may increase vascular
   plant establishment probabilities. A potential feedback process of
   long-term vegetation dynamics is suggested: disturbance of microbiotic
   crusts results in higher numbers of emerging plants, which in turn
   represent a rough seed-trapping element leading to a further increase in
   densities in consecutive years.}},

Abstract = {{Bilateral olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) in rats produces a
   well-characterized syndrome of behavioral, physiological, and

   experiments using in situ hybridization histochemistry have demonstrated
   that OBX increases prepro-neuropeptide-Y (NPY) and prepro-enkephalin
   (Eh'K) mRNA levels in limbic structures. The present experiments
   determined whether increases in peptide immunoreactivity occur in
   conjunction with increases in mRNA levels following OBX. In situ
   hybridization analyses in olfactory bulbectomized and sham-operated rats
   revealed increased prepro-ENK mRNA in the piriform cortex (PIR) and
   olfactory tubercles (OTs) of bulbectomized rats. Prepro-NPY mRNA levels
   were significantly increased in the PIR of bulbectomized rats as
   comapred to controls. Radioimmunoassays (RIAs) revealed significant
   elevations in ENK-like immunoreactivity in the OTs following OBX.
   NPY-like immunoreactivity was significantly elevated in the PIR
   following OBX. These data reveal that OBX-induced increases in ENK-like
   immunoreactivity occur concomitantly with increases in prepro-ENK mRNA,
   and NPY-like immunoreactivity occur concomitantly with increases in
   prepro-NPY mRNA. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The activation of kinases of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
   superfamily initiated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plays an important
   role in transducing inflammatory signals. The pathway leading to the
   induction of stress-activated protein kinases in macrophages stimulated
   with LPS was investigated. The activation of Jun N-terminal kinases
   (JNK) by LPS is herbimycin sensitive. Using specific inhibitors, it was
   shown that the pathway involves the activation of phosphoinositide
   3-kinase (PI 3-K), However, in contrast to previous reports, the small
   GTPases Cdc42 and Pac are not required downstream of PI 3-K for JNK
   activation. Instead, the phosphoinositides produced by PI 3-K stimulate
   protein kinase c (PKC) zeta activation through PDK1, In turn, activation
   of this atypical PKC leads to the stimulation of phosphatidylcholine
   phospholipase C (PC-PLC) and acidic sphingomyelinase (ASMase), It is
   therefore proposed that PKC zeta; regulates the PC-PLC/ASMase pathway,
   and It Is hypothesized that the resultant ceramide accumulation mediates
   the activation of the SEK/JNK module by LPS. (Blood. 2000;96:2592-2598)

Abstract = {{Background. Solar urticaria is a rare photodermatosis which often begins
   from the third to the fifth decade. Usual treatment consists of
   photoprotection measures and antihistamines although disease control is
   sometimes unsatisfactory with both. We report herein a very severe case
   of solar urticaria we treated with intravenous immunoglobulins.
   Case-report. A 55-year-old woman suffered for 3 years from very severe
   solar urticaria which resisted treatment. Phototests revealed two action
   spectra: the first in UVA near 380 nm with a minimal urticarian dose of
   0.025 J/cm(2), the second near 500 nm in visible light.
   Results. As last resort treatment, we gave our patient intravenous
   immunoglobulins. After the third course of treatment, the improvement
   was impressive as the patient could tolerate visible light and 15
   minutes of intense solar exposure. The minimal urticarian dose was
   raised from 0.025 J/cm(2) to 27 J/cm(2) in UVA. One year after
   treatment, the solar urticaria has disappeared.
   Conclusions. We report herein the first case of solar urticaria treated
   with success with immunoglobulin. Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment
   is well for its effectiveness in many autoimmune diseases such as
   autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, and also, as recently proven, in
   some cases of severe idiopathic chronic urticaria.}},

Abstract = {{A new structural waveguide, which is referred to as a channel-planar
   composite optical waveguide (COWG), has been fabricated by sputtering of
   a titanium dioxide (TiO2) film onto a glass substrate with potassium
   ion-exchanged channel waveguides. By use of a mask during deposition,
   the TiO2 film was formed into a 27-nm-thick, 5-mm-wide strip with two
   1-mm-long tapered ends perpendicular to the channel waveguides.
   Adiabatic transition of the TE00 mode and the TE00-TM00 mode separation
   inside such a channel-planar COWG were demonstrated by combination of
   theoretical analysis and measurement of the experimental attenuation
   that arises from scattering loss and evanescent-field dye absorption.
   Changing the superstrate index in the region of the TiO2 film in the
   channel-planar COWG yielded polarimetric interference patterns. This new
   technique can be applied to integrated optical chemical and biological
   sensors to produce enhanced sensitivity. (C) 2000 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{This research discusses polypropylene fibres and three sizes of steel
   fibres reinforced concrete. The total fibre content ranges from 0\% to
   0.95\% by volume of concrete. A four-point bending test is adopted on
   the notched prisms with the size of 100 x 100 x 500 mm(3) to investigate
   the effect of hybrid fibres on crack arresting. The research results
   show that there is a positive synergy effect between large steel fibres
   and polypropylene fibres on the load-bearing capacity and fracture
   toughness in the small displacement range. But this synergy effect
   disappears in the large displacement range. The large and strong steel
   fibre is better than soft polypropylene fibre and small steel fibre in
   the aspect of energy absorption capacity in the large displacement
   range. The static service limitation for the hybrid fibres concrete,
   with ``a wide peak{''} or ``multi-peaks{''} load-CMOD patterns, should
   be carefully selected. The ultimate load bearing capacity and the crack
   width or CMOD at this load level should be jointly considered in this
   case. The K-IC and fracture toughness of proper hybrid fibre system can
   be higher than that of mono-fibre system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{After the earthquakes of September 26, 1997, that hit the Umbria-Marche
   boundary (Apennine, Central Italy), with a maximum 6.0 M(w), a program
   of geochemical surveying together with a collection of hydrogeological
   changes episodes was extended throughout the epicentre-area, taking the
   yearly period of the seismic sequence as a whole. After a first areal
   screening, the Bagni di Triponzo thermal spring was selected for a
   discrete temporal monitoring (weekly and monthly basis), being the
   unique thermal spring throughout the epicentre area. This site deserves
   peculiar interest in deepening the knowledge about deep fluids
   circulation changing during seismicity. Laboratory and on-field analyses
   included major, minor and trace elements as well as dissolved gases (He,
   Ar, CH(4), CO(2), H(2)S, (222)Rn, NH(4), As, Li, Fe, B, etc..) and
   selected isotopic ratios (C, H, O, He, Sr, Cl), meaningful from tectonic
   point of view. The chemistry and isotopic chemistry of the spring were
   fully outlined and discussed, pointing out the main process involving
   the thermal aquifer: the water-rock interaction inside the Evaporite
   Triassic Basement (ETB), possibly involving also the Paleozoic
   Crystalline Basement. On the other hand, sudden and apparent geochemical
   and hydrogeological variations during the seismic sequence ruled out an
   evolution in the water-rock interaction processes. They occurred both at
   depth, i.e., induced by fluid remobilization within the crust explained
   by the Coseismic Strain Model and by the Fault Valve Activity Model, and
   in the shallow part of the reservoir (i.e., meteoric water
   contamination). A statistical multivariable analysis (Factor Analysis)
   was accomplished to better constrain the correlation between the
   paroxysmal phases of the seismic sequence and the observed trends and
   spike-like anomalies. The groundwater variations was inferred to occur
   mainly inside the ETB, from depth (1-2 km) up to surface, particularly
   in association of the Sellano earthquake (14/10/1997) and of the seismic
   re-activation of the sequence at the end of March 1998 (Gualdo
   Tadino-Rigali and Verchiano areas). The lack of deeper input from below
   the ETB (slight signature of PCB), as the lack of He mantle signature,
   during the seismic period as a whole, accounted for seismogenic fault
   segments rooted only in the crust. The results also provide useful
   information about the earthquake-related response mechanisms occurring
   at this site, that represent the basic task for planning and managing
   the impending hydro-geochemical network aimed at defining the
   relationships between seismic cycle, fluids and reliable earthquake
   forerunners.}},

Abstract = {{This study was carried out to assess the feasibility of late cord
   clamping of 45 s in preterm infants delivered mainly by caesarean
   section and the effects on postpartal adaptation and anaemia of
   prematurity. Prior to delivery, 40 infants of <33 gestational weeks were
   randomised to either 20 s or 45 s of late cord clamping. After the first
   shoulder was delivered, oxytocin was given intravenously to the mother
   in order to enhance placento-fetal transfusion while the infant was held
   below the level of the placenta. The 20 infants in group 1 (20 s) had a
   mean birth weight of 1070 g and a mean gestational age of 29 +/- 4/7
   weeks versus 1190 g and 30 weeks in group 2 (45 s). On day 42 of life
   there were ten infants without transfusions in group 2 versus three in
   group 1 (P < 0.05). Out of the 20 infants in group 1, 19 and 15/19 in
   group 2 were delivered by caesarean section. There were no significant
   differences in Apgar scores, temperature on admission, heart rate, blood
   pressure and requirements for artificial ventilation.
   Conclusion Delayed cord clamping of 45 s is feasible and safe in preterm
   infants below 33 weeks of gestation. It is possible to perform the
   procedure at caesarean section deliveries and it should be performed
   whenever possible. It reduces the need for packed red cell transfusions

   BLG and greater than that of T or P25. All hydrolysates except BNPS were
   less stable than BLG at all concentrations tested. This result was
   insured by texture analysis. Principal component analysis confirmed the
   distribution of the samples into three groups based on their increasing
   stability: (i): P25, (ii): P30 and P40, and (iii): BLG and BNPS. Tryptic
   hydrolysate had the poorest foaming properties. The results are
   considered in relation to the molecular characteristics of the peptides,
   particularly their size and hydrophobicity.}},

   Val-tRNA(Val) or Saccharomyces cerevisiae Phe-tRNA(Phe) as demonstrated
   by gel-shift and gel-filtration experiments. Evidence of such an
   interaction also came from the observation that SsEF-1 alpha . Gpp(NH)p
   was able to display a protective effect against either the spontaneous
   deacylation or the digestion of aminoacyl-tRNA by RNase A. Protection
   against the deacylation of aminoacyl-tRNA allowed evaluation of the
   affinity of SsEF-1 alpha . Gpp(NH)p for both aminoacyl-tRNAs used. The
   K-d' values of the ternary complex containing S. cerevisiae
   Phe-tRNA(Phe) or E. coli VaL-tRNA(Val) were 0.3 mu M and 4.4 mu M,
   respectively. In both cases, the affinity of SsEF-1 alpha . Gpp(NH)p for
   aminoacyl-tRNA was three orders of magnitude lower than that of the
   homologous eubacterial ternary complexes, but comparable with the
   affinity shown by the ternary complex involving eukaryal EF-1 alpha
   {[}Negrutskii, B.S. \& El'skaya, A.V. (1998) Frog. Nucleic Acids Res.

   in its GDP-bound form was also able to protect the ester bond of
   aminoacyl-tRNA, even though with a 10-fold lower efficiency compared
   with SsEF-1 alpha . Gpp(H)p. The overall results indicated that the
   archaeal elongation factor 1 alpha shares several properties with
   eukaryal EF-1 alpha but not with eubacterial EF-Tu.}},

Abstract = {{Surface EMG signals detected in dynamic conditions are affected by a
   number of artefacts. Among them geometrical factors play an important
   role. During movement the muscle slides with respect to the skin because
   of the variation of its length. Such a shift can considerably modify
   sEMG amplitude. The purpose of this work is to assess geometrical
   artefacts on sEMG during isometric contractions at different muscle
   lengths.
   The average rectified value (ARV) of 15 single differential signals was
   obtained by means of a linear array of 16 bar electrodes from the vastus
   medialis and lateralis muscles. The knee angle was changed from 75
   degrees to 165 degrees in steps of 30 degrees and voluntary isometric
   contractions at a low, medium and high force level were performed for
   each angle. The ARV pattern was normalized with respect to the mean
   activity to compare signals from different joint angles. From the data
   collected it was possible to separate the geometrical changes from the
   changes due to different intensities of activation.
   In three out of five subjects, we found (within the resolution of our
   measures) a 1 cm shift for the vastus medialis muscle while no shift was
   observed for the other two subjects. For the vastus lateralis muscle a 1
   cm shift was found in two out of four subjects. Such a shift produces
   the main contribution to geometrical artefacts. To avoid such artefacts
   the innervation zones should be located and the EMG electrodes should
   not be placed near them. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Chromosomal localization of 18S rDNA and telomere sequence was attempted
   on the chromosomes of the aye-aye (2n = 30) using fluorescence in situ
   hybridization (FISH) and primed in situ labeling (PRINS), respectively.
   The rDNA was localized at the tip or whole of the short arm of
   acrocentric chromosomes 13 and 14 in all spreads observed. However,
   post-FISH silver-nitrate (Ag) staining showed that transcriptional
   activity of the rRNA genes was variable, particularly in chromosome 14,
   which was most frequently negative in one homologue carrying the smaller
   copy number of rDNA. This observation supports, at the molecular
   cytogenetic level, previous data concerning the relationship between the
   copy number of rDNA and its trancriptional activity. On the other hand,
   telomere sequence was localized only at the telomeric region of all
   chromosomes, the so-called telomere-only pattern, a characteristic
   similar to that of the greater bushbaby. These data may provide
   information on the chromosomal evolution of the lemur, because locations
   of rDNA and telomere sequences frequently offer important clues in

Abstract = {{Open reading frame (ORF) O and ORF P partially overlap and are located
   antisense to the gamma(1)34.5 gene within the domain transcribed during
   latency. In wild-type virus-infected cells, ORF O and ORF P are
   completely repressed during productive infection by ICP4, the major
   viral transcriptional activator/repressor. In cells infected with a
   mutant in which ORF P was derepressed there was a significant delay in
   the appearance of the viral cu-regulatory proteins ICP0 and ICP22. The
   ORF O protein binds to and inhibits ICP4 binding to its cognate DNA site
   in vitro. These characteristics suggested a role for ORF O and ORF P in
   the establishment of latency. To test this hypothesis, two recombinant
   viruses were constructed. In the first, R7538(P-/O-), the ORF P
   initiator methionine codon, which also serves as the initiator
   methionine codon for ORF O, was replaced and a diagnostic restriction
   endonuclease was introduced upstream. In the second, R7543(P-/O-)R, the
   mutations were repaired to restore the wild-type virus sequences. We
   report the following. (i) The R7538(P-/O-) mutant failed to express ORF
   O and ORF P proteins but expressed a wild-type gamma(1)34.5 protein.
   (ii) R7538(P-/O-) yields were similar to that of the wild type following
   infection of cell culture or following infection of mice by
   intracerebral or ocular routes. (iii) R7538(P-/O-) virus reactivated
   from latency following explanation and cocultivation of murine
   trigeminal ganglia with Vero cells at a frequency similar to that of the
   wild type, herpes simplex virus 1(F). (iv) The amount of latent
   R7538(P-/O-) virus as assayed by quantitative PCR is eightfold less than
   that of the repair virus. The repaired virus could not be differentiated
   from the nild-type parent in any of the assays done in this study. We
   conclude that ORF O and ORF P are not essential for the establishment of
   latency in mice but may play a role in determining the quantity of
   latent virus maintained in sensory neurons.}},

Abstract = {{The venom of South American rattlesnake Crotalus durissus terrificus is
   very toxic but poorly immunogenic and it has an immunosuppressive
   ability. The heating of venom at 56, 70 or 100 degrees C for 30 min
   caused a diminution in the lethal, phospholipase A(2) and myotoxic
   activities. SDS-PAGE analysis of the heated venom showed that the
   proteins of higher molecular weights were the most affected by heating
   whereas proteins with lower molecular weights (20,000-14,000) were the
   most resistant to heating. The immunosuppressive effect was studied in
   mice immunized with human serum albumin (HSA) 1 h after receiving either
   heated Venom or heated crotoxin. The heating of venom at 70 or 100
   degrees C reduced its immunosuppressive effect whereas crotoxin had its
   suppressive effect reduced only when heated at 100 degrees C. The
   heating of venom at 56, 70 or 100 degrees C did not change its
   immunogenicity.
   These results suggest that heat treatment may be a useful technique to
   help in the production of antiserum to crotalid venom. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The S protein-S peptide interaction is a model system to study binding
   thermodynamics in proteins. We substituted alanine at position 4 in S
   peptide by a-aminoisobutyric acid (iiib) to investigate the effect of
   this substitution on the conformation of free S peptide and on its
   binding to S protein. The thermodynamic consequences of this replacement
   were studied using isothermal titration calorimetry, The structures of
   the free and complexed peptides were studied using circular dichroic
   spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, respectively. The alanine4Aib
   replacement stabilizes the free S peptide helix and does not perturb the
   tertiary structure of RNase S, Surprisingly, and in contrast to the
   wild-type S peptide, the DeltaG degrees of binding of peptide to S pro,
   over the temperature range 5-30 degreesC, is virtually independent of
   temperature, At 25 degreesC, the Delta DeltaG degrees, Delta DeltaH
   degrees, Delta DeltaS and Delta DeltaC(p) of binding are 0.7 kcal/mol,
   2.8 kcal/mol, 6 kcal/mol.K and -60 kcal/mol.K, respectively. The
   positive value of MS is probably due to a decrease in the entropy of
   uncomplexed alanine4Aib relative to the wild-type peptide. The positive
   value of Delta DeltaH degrees is unexpected and is probably due to
   favorable interactions formed in uncomplexed alanine4Aib, This study
   addresses the thermodynamic and structural consequences of a replacement
   of alanine by Aib both in the unfolded and complexed states in proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Research has already examine the relationship between planning and
   success of small firms, but the conclusions drawn are inconsistent. In
   this study, we argue that the relationship between planning and success
   is dependent on the cultural context. Planning strategies and their
   relationship to success were compared In 7 Irish, 102 East German, and
   98 West German small-scale enterprises. In Germany, planning had a
   positive influence on success, while this relationship teas negative in
   Ireland Moreover planning strategies were found to mediate the
   relationship between busk ness owners' achievement orientations and
   success. This mediating influence was positive in Germany and negative
   in ireland These differences are interpreted to be due to a higher level
   of uncertainty avoidance in Germany, (Hofstede 1991) which makes
   planning culturally, appropriate and successful.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), the uncoupler of
   mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, on the Ca2+-sensitive Cl-
   current component of the transient outward current (I-TO2). Amphotericin
   B perforated-patch, whole-cell patch-clamp technique was employed (35
   degrees C) using enzymatically isolated single rabbit atrial myocytes.
   We defined I-TO2 as the amplitude of the 2 mM 4-aminopyridine resistant
   transient outward current sensitive to anthracene-9-carboxylic acid
   (A9C). Between +5 and +45 mV, 0.2 mM A9C inhibited I-TO2 by similar to
   70\% (n = 13). Within 30 s after application of 0.2 mM DNP, both normal
   I-TO2 transients (n = 8) and the I-TO2 transients that remained after
   A9C treatment (n = 8) were inhibited completely. In cells expressing
   I-TO2 (70\% of total), DNP also suppressed an A9C-insensitive slow
   outward current by similar to 40\%, but the holding current at -80 mV
   was unaffected. There was a similar to 2 min latency between inhibitory
   effects of DNP and subsequent membrane current increase, presumably
   caused by activation of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels (n = 16). We
   conclude that DNP acutely inhibits I-TO2 via a mechanism presumably
   separate from metabolic inhibition.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aim-An oral glutamine load in cirrhotic patients awaiting
   liver transplantation was shown to cause a rise in blood ammonia and
   psychometric abnormalities which were reversed by hepatic
   transplantation. L-Omithine-L-aspartate (LOLA) has been shown to reduce
   ammonia and improve psychometric function in patients with hepatic
   encephalopathy. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of
   LOLA in healthy patients with cirrhosis and no evidence of clinical
   encephalopathy after challenging the central nervous system by
   administration of oral glutamine.
   Patients and methods-Eight cirrhotics (Child's B or C) without
   transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) and seven with
   TIPS underwent two oral glutamine (20 g) challenges, receiving LOLA (5 g
   intravenously) on one occasion and placebo on the other in random order.
   Psychometric tests, including choice reaction time (CRT) and number
   connection test, were performed before and after glutamine, together
   with electroencephalography and blood ammonia.
   Results-Mean basal ammonia was 27 (SEM. 5) mu mol/l in non-TIPS and 76
   (10) mu mol/l in TIPS patients (p<0.05). Basal CRT 2 was 0.643 (0.033) s
   in non-TIPS and 0.825 (0.076) s in TIPS patients (p<0.02). In non-TIPS
   patients, ammonia increased to 36 (10) mu mol/l when LOLA was
   administered and to 62 (13) mu mol/l with placebo (p<0.02). There was no
   alteration in psychometric function in non-TIPS patients after glutamine
   when LOLA was given but when placebo was given, glutamine caused
   prolongation of CRT (p=0.02). Glutamine did not affect psychometric
   function in TIPS patients with or without LOLA. LOLA ameliorated
   Conclusion-This LOLA ameliorated the deleterious psychometric effects of
   glutamine in Child's grade a and C patients with cirrhosis without TIPS
   and supports its use in clinical practice in hepatic encephalopathy.}},

Abstract = {{Avalanche photodiodes (APD) are solid state quantum detectors suitable
   for low level light detection in the visible and near infrared regions.
   These devices are commercially available from many manufacturers and are
   fabricated using several different solid state structures. In this paper
   a comparison between the well developed reach through structure (RTS)
   APD and the relatively newer super low ionization ratio, kappa, (SLIK)
   APD structure will be discussed. The comparison is based on the
   experimental characterization of two APDs with these structures. The
   characterization setup and experiments will be described which include
   the calibration of the APDs, temperature response, bias voltage
   response, and noise measurements including noise-equivalent-power and
   detectivity D{*}. For this comparison the selected RTS APD is the EG\&G
   C30955E, currently used by the lidar atmospheric sensing experiment
   (LASE) instrument. The selected SLIK APD is the EG\&G C30649E, which is
   proposed for LASE development. The characterization experiments where

   Numerical simulation on parallel computers, and the distribution of
   problems over several computers in a computer complex with the resultant
   high computer capacity, allow multidimensional, transient, compressible,
   turbulent, and chemically reactive flows to be computed.
   With this type of computer system it is possible, for instance, to
   handle the hydrogen problem in reactor containments in the course of
   accidents exceeding the design basis and, in this way, develop

Abstract = {{A closed-form analytical solution for the Stokes flow generated by a
   corotating two-roll mill is used to generate two-dimensional
   elongational flows with well-defined amounts of vorticity. These flow
   devices can generate conditions found between simple shear and purely
   elongational flows, and are among the few systems that can take into
   account the presence of nearby boundaries. In the laboratory, these
   devices have been used for studies of the microstructural dynamics of
   complex fluids such as polymeric solutions, colloids, bubbles and drops,
   etc., and allow pointwise optical studies of the flow parameters. Hence,
   a comparison is presented of available experimental and numerical
   results for the stagnation point versus the analytical solution
   presented here. Based upon this solution, a new design for the two-roll
   mill is presented for the purpose of minimizing the disadvantages of

Abstract = {{An evolutionary algorithm for optimizing local control of chaos is
   presented. Based on a Lyapunov approach, a linear control law and the
   state-space region in which this control law is activated are
   determined, In addition, we study a relation between certain adjustable
   design parameters and a particular measure of the uncontrolled chaotic
   attractor in the state-space region of control (SSRC). From this
   relation the objective function to be optimized is derived. In that
   context, we assume a linear control law to be given and optimize size
   and shape of the SSRC using an evolutionary algorithm. It is shown by
   examples how the algorithm can also be applied to higher-dimensional
   systems with possibly more than one positive Lyapunov exponent. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{We studied composition, structure, and growth parameters of amorphous

   pulsed laser deposition in vacuum and in nitrogen atmosphere. The
   composition (0 less than or equal to N/C less than or equal to 0.4), the
   structural and the electronic properties of the deposited carbon and
   carbon nitride films were investigated for different laser fluences
   (1-12 J/cm(2)). Electron energy loss spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, and micro-Raman spectroscopy indicated an increase in
   sp(3)-bonded carbon sites in the DLC films and an increase in N-sp(3) C
   bonded sites in the CNx films with increasing deposition laser fluence.
   Raman spectroscopy also showed the presence of a small amount of C=N
   bonds in the CNx films. Furthermore, we observed that keeping the
   nitrogen pressure constant (P=100 mTorr) the increase in the deposition
   laser fluence is reflected by an increase in the nitrogen content in the
   films. All the results have been discussed in the framework of different
   theoretical models. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{We have genotyped over 550 cases of acute leukaemia and 950 matched
   controls from a population-based case-control study, to investigate the
   impact cytochrome P450s 2D6, 2C19 and 1A1 have on susceptibility to
   adult acute leukaemia. Analysis included potential associations between
   polymorphic status and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute
   lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), plus the FAB and cytogenetic subtypes
   therein, A significant increased risk was found for CYP2D6 poor
   metabolizer phenotype and acute leukaemia {[}odds ratio (OR)= 1.69, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 1.17-2.43], a risk also found in AML and ALL.
   No interaction was found with smoking, However, a significant
   age-related association between CYP2D6 polymorphism and acute myeloid
   leukaemia implied that the excess risk was confined to persons aged 40
   years and over (OR 2.38, 95\% CI 1.53-3.71). Amongst AML cases,
   increased odds ratios were observed in both ne-novo (OR 1.54, 95\% CI

   1.11-3.61), An increased risk was found for the CYP2C19 poor metabolizer
   phenotype (OR 1.68, 95\% CI 0.97-2.92) which was also present in AML and
   ALL. For this CYP450 locus, an increased risk was suggested in secondary

   chromosomal abnormality (OR 6.72, 95\% CI 2.22-20.4). No difference in

Abstract = {{Background: Inner-surface-reconstruction calculated from helical-CT data
   sets offers a new diagnostic option for upper airway assessment. Using a
   special software, it is possible to create a continuous overview on the
   inner surface of hollow viscera on a monitor, similar to an endoscopic
   view. However, reports on the clinical value of this examination
   procedure with regard to laryngeal or tracheal stenosis are rare.
   Method: We compared the results of this ``virtual endoscopy{''} with
   real endoscopic or intraoperative findings in 11 patients suffering from
   laryngeal or tracheal stenosis of various etiologies. Results: Data on
   extension and localization of airway stenosis obtained by virtual
   endoscopy corresponded well with our endoscopic or intraoperative
   findings in all patients. The grade of airway stenosis as assessed by
   inner-surface-reconstruction could be confirmed by endoscopy in 8 of 11
   cases investigated. Detection of 2 additional airway stenoses distal to
   an endoscopically non-passable tracheal stenosis was possible by virtual
   endoscopy in one case. Conclusion: As a supportive diagnostic procedure,
   virtual endoscopy offers a valuable overview on extension and
   localization of laryngeal or tracheal stenoses with regard to a possible
   therapeutic management.}},

Abstract = {{Over a period of 3 years, five agronomically distinct crops of winter
   wheat were grown in plots in which straw (1 kg m(-2)), manure (4 kg
   m(-2)) or nothing were incorporated into the soil. Plant establishment
   and height, but not leaf area per tiller, were lower in straw-treated
   plots. Fertilizer regimes differed between years. Soil and leaf nitrogen
   were recorded; there was no obvious link between N and any disease or
   soil amendment. The numbers of leaf layers scorable for disease were
   similar in all treatments. At the end of the season, plants from
   straw-treated plots had consistently reduced septoria tritici blotch
   (caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola), powdery mildew {[}caused by
   Erysiphe (Blumeria) graminis], brown rust (caused by Puccinia recondita)
   and foot rot (caused by Fusarium spp.). Early on, M. graminicola was
   worse in straw-treated plots. In manure-treated plots, P. recondita was
   reduced but effects on other diseases were inconsistent and slight. A
   fungicide, chlorothalonil, was applied in one crop; its effects did not
   interact with those of other treatments. Mycosphaerella graminicola was
   not suppressed by straw in outdoor pot experiments. Late in the season,
   straw-treated plants had significantly higher leaf silica (P < 0.01). In
   a glasshouse experiment, plants supplied with silicon had less E.
   graminis infection (P < 0.001) and higher leaf silica, but effects on M.
   graminicola were inconsistent. A prior inoculation of M. graminicola
   primed plant defences against a subsequent attack of E. graminis, but
   only in the presence of adequate Si. It is postulated that straw acts in
   the field by increasing Si availability.}},

   (MCP)-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 beta, as well as
   the cell adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and
   CD44 in the human monocytic cell line THP-1, Amphotericin B increased
   the concentrations of IL-8, MCP-1, and MIP-1 beta in a dose-dependent
   fashion. Amphotericin B also induced expression of ICAM-1 but not CD44
   in these cells. Production of these proteins in response to amphotericin
   B may play a role in the immunomodulatory activity and toxicity of this
   antifungal agent.}},

Abstract = {{Fyn protein tyrosine kinase is present in the unfertilized and
   fertilized egg, becomes activated within minutes following
   fertilization, and has been localized to the cortical cytoplasm and
   spindle apparatus of the zygote. In order to establish the expression
   pattern of Fyn in the early embryo, we examined the distribution pattern
   of Fyn by immunofluorescence microscopy. Fyn protein is distributed
   evenly among cells of the cleavage stage zebrafish embryo and is
   concentrated in the cortical region of each cell. During blastula and
   gastrula stages, Fyn was expressed in all cells, however a subpopulation
   of cells exhibited strong nuclear staining for Fyn. Nuclear Fyn staining
   was not observed after the gastrula period of development, nor in the
   adult zebrafish. Immunoprecipitation of Fyn from isolated mid-blastula
   nuclei confirmed Fyn was present in the nucleus. This is, to our
   knowledge, the first demonstration of Fyn kinase, which lacks a nuclear
   localization signal, present in the nucleus. The transient
   compartmentalization of Fyn in the nucleus could be important in nuclear
   signaling. Anat Rec 260:115-123, 2000. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Scholars have advanced various theories to explain the common failure of
   market leaders in the face of revolutionary technological change. The
   history of NCR Corporation provides an instructive exception to that
   general pattern. This paper examines how NCR addressed the introduction
   of electronics to the field of business equipment and the advent of
   digital computers to widespread use. It describes NCR's entry into the
   computer industry in the 1950s and its commitment to evolutionary
   adaptation of its core products. It shows how persistence in old modes
   of practice led eventually to a crisis, which was resolved favorably
   when new management and fundamental organizational transformations
   reversed adverse trends and restored robust profitability.
   While established academic theories can help to explain aspects of the
   story, no single theoretical perspective is sufficient to explain the
   path of NCR's behavior. NCR survived, we conclude, because new
   leadership provided the impetus to actualize latent dynamic
   capabilities. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Dendritic cells are key players of the immune system as they efficiently
   induce primary immune responses by activating naive T cells. We
   generated human dendritic cells from CD14(+) blood precursors and
   investigated expression of the actin-bundling protein fascin during
   maturation by western blotting, immunofluorescence, and cytofluorometry,
   Cells obtained by culture of CD14(+) blood precursors in the presence of
   granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-1,
   which were only weakly positive for the maturation marker CD83,
   expressed low amounts of fascin. Addition of a cytokine cocktail
   including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta,
   interleukin-6, and prostaglandin E-2 induced maturation of the cells and
   enhanced fascin expression in parallel with CD83 expression. Isolated
   mature CD83(+) cells displayed especially high fascin levels on western
   blots, as did gated CD83+ dendritic cells in cytofluorometry. Dendritic
   cells generated from CD34(+) blood precursors expressed high levels of
   fascin as well. Confocal microscopy revealed that location of fascin
   within the cell was restricted to the area of the submembranous actin
   cytoskeleton and to the dendritic processes. Suppression experiments
   using antisense constructs of fascin hint at a retarded morphologic
   maturation of dendritic cells, supporting the view that fascin
   expression is pivotal for dendrite formation. Our data suggest that
   fascin could serve as a marker molecule to monitor the maturation state
   of in vitro generated dendritic cells for use in clinical trials.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To determine the burden of the HIV epidemic on paediatric
   inpatient facilities in the teaching hospitals of the Cape metropole and
   tributaries to these hospitals.
   Setting. Second- and third-level hospitals.
   Method. During the second week of March 1999 a multicentre collaborative
   census was performed of all paediatric beds in the teaching hospitals of
   Cape Town and all facilities draining to and from them.
   Results. One hundred and six HIV-infected patients were identified from
   a total of 1264 beds. Thirty-nine children were in second-level beds or
   in a long-term residential facility Fifty-six children were in
   second-level beds designated for acute care, and occupied 12\% of all
   such beds. Ten children were in beds designated for the care of
   tuberculosis. Thirty-two (56\%) of the acute admissions were for
   gastro-enteritis, and 13 (23\%) were for pneumonia. In 10 children (18\%
   of all admissions) recognised complications of HIV infection were direct
   causes of admission. For 29 children (35\% of all admissions) the
   current admission was the first; the remainder had had a mean of 2.4
   previous admissions. Fourteen children (25\%) had received oxygen, and
   26 (46\%) had received intravenous therapy. Mean lifetime
   hospitalisation cost per infected child was calculated to be R19 712 The
   projected cost of a local initiative to reduce mother-to-child
   transmission is between R8 326 and R10 806 per-vertical infection
   prevented.
   Conclusion. The inpatient burden of HIV-infected children in Cape Town
   reflects an early stage of the epidemic. Compared with projected
   lifetime hospitalisation cost for infected children, an intervention to
   reduce vertical transmission cost would be cost effective.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation process of natural stones is reproduced by performing
   low-cycle-number, uniaxial compression fatigue tests on three different
   qualities of marble. A typical feature of fatigue tests is that
   repetition of loading cycles produces a progressive accumulation of
   permanent strain in the specimen, rather than any significant decay in
   the material's elastic moduli. This permanent deformation has been
   recognized as both due to the opening of micro-cracks as well as due to
   shear-like mechanisms. The relative contribution of each of these
   mechanisms to the overall behaviour of the materials depends heavily
   upon the orientation of the rift plane of the specimen, that is, whether
   the specimen has been cut with its axis orthogonal to the marble rift
   plane or parallel to it. In the first case, shear-like deformations are
   the most evident signs of the failure mechanism, while in the second,
   the marked increases in volume due to micro-cracking are evident early.
   Scanning electron microscope studies performed, evidence that there are
   two different phases in the marble's behaviour: the first one is
   characterized by calcite grain decohesion, that is, the grains remain
   integral, but detach along their interfaces upon repeated load cycles
   (grain de-cohesion); while in the second stage, there are evident signs
   of transgranular micro-cracking. These two distinct phases are shown to
   correlate with different stages in the material's macroscopic response
   to cyclic loading. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   (MTO) as the catalyst to give nitriles. Elimination of
   dimethylhydroxylamine that is further oxidized to N-methyl-M-methylene
   N-oxide takes place. This nitrone was fully characterized as such and
   also as its cycloaddition product with methylmethacrylate. This system
   tolerates many other functionalities and especially carbon-carbon double
   bonds which are not epoxidized under the precise conditions outlined
   herewith. The reaction has also been extended to a few hydrazones
   derived from ketones: a good recovery of the ketones is again observed.
   In one case, the fate of the protecting group could also be established:
   as for hydrazones of aldehydes, a nitrone is formed upon the
   nitrogen-nitrogen bond rupture. (C) 2000 Academie des sciences/Editions

   opposes adopting substitutes for this approach to knowledge. Teleology
   needs to be furthered in psychotherapy because it is a genuinely
   accurate portrayal of human beings and because there is a pressing need
   for improvement in ethico-moral realms of behavior that mechanical

Abstract = {{CD9 and CD63 belong to a tetramembrane-spanning glycoprotein family
   called tetraspanin, and are involved in a wide variety of cellular
   processes, but the structure-function relationship of this family of
   proteins has yet to be clarified. CD9 associates with diphtheria toxin
   receptor (DTR), which is identical to the membrane-anchored form of
   heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (proHB-EGF). CD9 upregulates the
   diphtheria toxin (DT) binding activity of DTR/proHB-EGF, while CD63 does
   not upregulate the DT binding activity in spite of the fact that this
   protein also associates with DTR/proHB-EGF on the cell surface, CD9
   molecules localize on the cell surface, while those of CD63 localize
   predominantly at lysosomes and intracellular compartments, We made
   CD9/CD63 chimeric molecules and then studied their intracellular
   localization and upregulation activities. The C-terminal regions of
   CD63, which includes the lysosome sorting motif, showed a strong
   inhibitory effect on the expression of the chimeric proteins at the cell
   surface, while mutants lacking the lysosome sorting motif delivered more
   efficiently on the cell surface, indicating that the lysosome sorting
   motif contributes to the inhibitory effect of the C-terminal region.
   However, the N-terminal half of this family of proteins containing the
   1st to 3rd transmembrane domains also seems to influence the cell
   surface expression. For the upregulation of DT binding activity the
   large extracellular loop (EC2) of CD9 was essential, while the remaining
   regions influenced the upregulation activity by changing the efficiency
   of cell surface expression, From these results we discussed the
   structure-function relationship of this family of proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Hydatid disease may affect several organs in the human body and thus
   represents a major challenge for the general surgeon. The aim of this
   study was to analyze the multiple clinical presentations of hydatid
   disease and the surgical options according to the involved organ. The
   medical records of 272 adult patients operated on for hydatid disease in
   our department during the period 1970-1996 were retrospectively
   reviewed. The most commonly involved organ was the liver (204 patients;
   75\%), followed by the lung (42 patients; 15.4\%) and the spleen (14
   patients; 5.1\%). In 12 patients, the cysts were located in uncommon
   sites: in the pancreas (4 patients; 1.5\%), the gallbladder (2 patients;
   0.74\%), the kidney, the thyroid gland, the breast, the pericardium, the
   supraclavicular region and the thigh (1 patient in each case; 0.37\%).
   Clinical symptomatology varied according to anatomic location and
   pre-operative diagnosis was accomplished with plain abdominal films,
   ultrasound, computerized tomography and serological tests. The surgical
   procedures performed included simple closure with drainage, unroofing of
   the cyst with omentoplasty (for liver cysts), marsupialization, cyst
   excision, excision of the involved organ or combinations of procedures.
   Postoperative morbidity was mainly due to septic complications (n = 41),
   postoperative bleeding (n = 2), deep vein thrombosis (n = 2) and
   fistulae (n = 13). Four patients died in the early postoperative period
   (mortality rate, 1.5\%) secondary to septic complications (n = 3) and
   pulmonary embolism (it = 1). During long-term follow-tip, 14 patients
   developed recurrent disease. In conclusion, hydatid disease should be
   included in the differential diagnosis of cystic masses in solid organs
   or other anatomic sites, especially in endemic countries. Since there is
   not an effective medical treatment, surgery still remains the treatment
   of choice, offering a good clinical result and an acceptable recurrence
   rate.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the interaction between handling cost and growth of
   the bivalve-feeder Halla okudai (Polychaeta: Lysaretidae), the
   observation of foraging behavior and measurement of energy budget were
   conducted in laboratory feeding experiments by offering three different
   bivalves: the short-neck clam Ruditapes philippinarum, the blue mussel
   Mytilus galloprovinciallis, and the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas.
   The total handling time was 1.6-2.7 times longer in the oyster-group
   (25.6+/-9.3 h) than in the clam and mussel-groups, while the total
   searching and feeding time hardly varied with prey species. No
   significant difference in the amount of ingestion (4.5-5.3
   kcal/polychaete per 15 days) was shown among the three prey groups.
   However, the growth increment was 1.5-2.1 times higher in the clam-group
   (1.85+/-0.65 kcal/polychaete per 15 days) than in the other two prey
   groups. in contrast, the scope for active rate of respiration and
   jelly-like material secreted during handling was higher in the
   oyster-group (0.66+/-0.14 and 0.24+/-0.07 kcal/polychaete per 15 days,
   respectively) and mussel-group (0.62+/-0.07 and 0.16+/-0.05
   kcal/polychaete per 15 days) than in the clam-group (0.48+/-0.09 and
   0.06+/-0.01 kcal/polychaete per 15 days), although there were no
   significant differences in the standard rate of respiration, excretion,
   feces and jelly-like material secreted during feeding among the three
   groups. These results indicate that growth of H. okudai increases with a
   decreasing handling cost, when feeding on the optimal prey species.}},

Abstract = {{Semibatch emulsion polymerisation of butyl acrylate with neat monomer
   feed in the presence of sodium lauryl sulphate as emulsifier and
   potassium persulphate as initiator was investigated. The effects of
   monomer feed rate, emulsifier concentration, initiator concentration,
   temperature, and pre-period time on the kinetic features were studied.
   It was shown that a steady state is established which can be best
   described by the correlation suggested by Wessling as 1/R-p = 1/K +
   1/R-a. An expression was derived for instantaneous monomer conversion
   which can predict the effects of important variables such as feed rates,
   seed composition, and seed contents on the evolution of steady state.
   Those predictions were compatible with the experimental results. For all
   practical purposes, it was shown that the time it takes to reach the
   near steady-state increases with monomer feed rate for non-swollen
   particles, and decreases with monomer feed rate for monomer-swollen
   particles. However, the time required to reach the real steady state is
   always minimum at the lowest monomer feed rate for all seed
   compositions. Pre-period time was shown to have considerable effects on
   the time required to reach a steady state, but had no appreciable
   effects on the final number of particles formed or on the steady-state
   rate of reaction at the conditions studied. However, the particle
   nucleation process was influenced by the size of the initial monomer
   charge and by the duration of the pre-period. The average number of
   radicals per particle reached a steady-state value early in the
   polymerisation. Polymerisation rate and particle number both increased
   with temperature. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The alpha-adrenergic agonists have been demonstrated to have synergistic
   effects with opioids and local anesthetics in animal research. The
   present study was pel;Formed to determine whether the addition of
   adrenaline improves the analgesic effects of an epidural infusion of a
   combination of fentanyl and bupivacaine after abdominal surgery. We
   studied 90 ASA I or 2 patients scheduled for abdominal surgery under
   epidural anaesthesia, with or without general anaesthesia. Patients were
   randomly divided into two groups to receive a postoperative epidural
   infusion of fentanyl 5 mug/ml in bupivacaine 0.2\%, with or without
   adrenaline 5 mug/ml, at a rate of 2 ml/h for more than 48 hours.
   Postoperative pain relief was assessed using visual analog scales (VAS),
   both at rest and during coughing, at 2, 24 and 48 hours after surgery.
   The number of rescue analgesics and side-effects such as nausea
   vomiting, pruritus, respiratory depression, headache, muscle weakness,
   and hypotension were recorded.
   Patients who received adrenaline (n=40) reported significantly lower
   mean VAS scores than those who received no adrenaline (n=37), both at
   rest at 24 hems postoperatively and during coughing at 24 and 48 hours.
   The number of additional analgesics and incidence of side-effects did
   not differ between groups. In conclusion, the results of the present
   study demonstrate that the addition of adrenaline to a combination of
   fentanyl and bupivacaine improves the quality of epidural analgesia
   after abdominal surgery. Under the conditions of the study, we did not
   detect any disadvantage from the addition of adrenaline.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied a new adhesive bone cement, that consists of
   4-methacryloyloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride (4-META) and
   methylmethacrylate (MMA) as monomers, tri-n-butyl borane (TBB) as the
   initiator, and polymethylmethacrylate powder (4-META/MMA-TBB cement).
   This cement has shown remarkable adhesive properties to bone in vitro.
   In this study, we assessed the interface in viz,a periodically. The
   femora of rabbits were fenestrated and filled with either the
   4-META/MMA-TBB cement or a conventional polymethylmethacrylate cement.
   The animals were killed after 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks to analyze the
   interlace by optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.
   Optical microscopic examinations showed that the cured 4-META/MMA-TBB
   adhesive cement bonded to bone directly for 24 weeks, whereas a fibrous
   tissue layer was observed between the bone and cured conventional cement
   at 12 weeks after the operation. The transmission electron microscopy
   views of 4-META/MMA-TBB cement bonded to bone demonstrated a unique
   ``hybridized bone{''} with the cement in the subsurface of the substrate
   in every case. The formation of the hybridized bone indicates the
   bonding mechanism of the adhesive cement to bone, which prevents the
   fibrosis intervention between bone and cement. These results suggest
   that the biomechanical and adhesive properties of 4-META/MMA-TBB cement
   make it a useful bone-bonding agent in orthopedic surgery. (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{The kinetics of the oxidative color removal from congo red dye using
   H2O2 in conjunction with transition metal ions supported on ZrO2 were
   studied. The rate of reaction is first order on H2O2, the catalyst, and
   in congo red. It attains a limiting rate at higher concentrations of
   reagent. Also, the rate of reaction decreases with increasing {[}H+],
   due to protonation of the substrate amino groups, as well as to the low
   deprotonation constant of H2O2 in acid medium. Addition of KCl to the
   mixture increased the rate of reaction. The catalytic activity of the

   Mn-II > Fe-III > Ni-II > ZrO2 which is correlated with the redox
   potential, mg loading and \% surface content of the supported metal
   ions. A probable mechanism for the oxidation processes has been
   suggested, which is consistent with the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Mice with a targeted mutation in the gene that encodes the transcription
   factor IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) were used to assess the
   contribution of IRF-1 to IL-12-dependent and IL-12-independent pathways
   of IFN-gamma production. In response to LPS, IRF-1(-/-) mice produced
   less IL-12 p40, IL-12 p35, and IFN-gamma mRNA in the liver than
   IRF-1(+/+) mice. While pulmonary IFN-gamma mRNA levels were also
   mitigated in IRF-1(-/-) mice, pulmonary IL-12 p40 and IL-12 p35 mRNA
   were not dysregulated. Circulating IL-12 p70 and IFN-gamma levels were
   profoundly attenuated in LPS-challenged IRF-1(-/-) mice. Further
   analysis revealed a major deficiency in hepatic IL-12R beta 1 and IL-12R
   beta 2 mRNA expression as well as pulmonary IL-12R beta 1 mRNA
   expression in LPS-challenged IRF-1(-/-) mice. In vitro, IFN-gamma
   up-regulated IL-12R beta 1 mRNA in macrophages from IRF-1(+/+), but not
   IRF-1(-/-), mice. IFN-gamma-induced IL-12R beta 2 mRNA expression was
   also diminished in macrophages from IRF-1(-/-) mice. In contrast to
   IRF-1(+/+) mice, administration of exogenous IL-12 to IRF-1(-/-) mice
   resulted in reduced serum IFN-gamma and hepatic and pulmonary IFN-gamma
   mRNA, demonstrating that loss of IL-12R results in diminished IL-12
   responsiveness. While LPS-challenged IRF-1(-/-) mice also had reduced
   IL-15 mRNA levels, serum IL-18 responses were intact. Finally, induction
   of IRF-1 mRNA by LPS in livers of IFN-gamma knockout mice were markedly
   attenuated, suggesting a feedback amplification loop. These studies
   indicate that IRF-1 deficiency disrupts both IL-12-dependent and
   -independent pathways of IFN-gamma production and that IRF-1 is a
   critical transcription factor involved in the regulation of not only
   IL-12, but also IL-12R.}},

Abstract = {{Point mutations of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase are responsible for
   the inheritance of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes
   and are also present in a fraction of sporadic medullary thyroid
   carcinomas. Somatic rearrangements of the RET gene generating the
   chimeric RET/papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) oncogenes are the
   predominant molecular lesions associated with papillary carcinoma, the
   most frequent thyroid malignancy in humans. Oncogenic mutations cause
   constitutive activation of the kinase function of RET, which, in turn,
   results in the autophosphorylation of RET tyrosine residues critical for
   signaling. In vitro kinase assays previously revealed six putative RET
   autophosphorylation sites. The aim of the present study was to assess
   the phosphorylation of two such residues, tyrosines 1015 and 1062 (Y1015
   and Y1062), in the in vivo signaling of RET and PET-derived oncogenes.
   Using phosphorylated RET-specific antibodies, we demonstrate that both
   Y1015 and Y1062 are rapidly phosphorylated upon ligand triggering of
   RET. Moreover, regardless of the nature of the underlying activating
   mutation, the concomitant phosphorylation of Y1015 and Y1062 is a common
   feature of the various oncogenic RET products (MEN2A, MEN2B, and PTC).
   This study shows that Ab-pY1062 is a useful tool with which to detect
   activated RET in human tumor cells and surgical samples. Finally, the
   microinjection of Ab-pY1062 antibodies into living cells demonstrates
   that Ret/PTC1 signaling is required to maintain the mitogenesis of a
   human carcinoma cell line expressing the Ret/PTC1 oncoprotein.}},

Abstract = {{Background Besides a clear relationship to silicosis, crystalline
   silica-quartz-has been associated with lung cancer nonmalignant renal
   disease, and auto-immune disease, To study diseases associated with
   crystalline silica further NIOSH conducted a cohort mortality study of
   workers from 18 silica sand plants, which had quarry, crushing, and
   bagging operations to produce industrial sand. Twelve of these plants
   also had grinding mills to produce fine silica powder: The historical
   crystalline silica exposures of workers at these plants were estimated
   to facilitate exposure-response analyses in the epidemiologic study.
   Methods NIOSH obtained personal respirable dust measurement records from
   Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) compliance inspections at
   all 18 plants and from the archives of seven plants which had collected
   samples. These samples had been analyzed for quartz content by x-ray
   diffraction. Although no personal samples were available before 1974,
   impinger dust measurements were reported for 19 silica sand plants in
   1946; these data were converted and used to estimate exposures prior to
   1974. Statistical modeling of the samples was used to estimate quartz
   exposure concentrations for workers in plant-job-year categories from
   the 1930s when mortality follow-up of the cohort began until 1988 when
   follow-up stopped.
   Results Between 1974 and 1996 there were 4,269 respirable dust samples
   collected at these 18 plants. The geometric mean quartz concentration
   was 25.9 mu g/m(3) (GSD = 10.9) with a range from less than I to 11, 700
   mu g/m(3). Samples below 1 mu g/m(3) were given a value of 0.5 mu
   g/m(3). Over one-third of the samples (37\%) exceeded the MSHA
   permissible exposure limit value for quartz (PEL = 10 mg/m(3)/(\%quartz
   + 2)) and half (51\%) of the samples exceeded the NIOSH recommended
   exposure limit (REL=50 mu g/m(3)). The samples were collected from
   workers performing 143 jobs within the 18 plants, but too few samples
   were collected from many of the jobs to make accurate estimates.
   Therefore, samples were combined into 10 categories of jobs performing
   similar tasks or located within the same plant area.
   Conclusions The quartz concentrations varied significantly by plant,
   job, and year: Quartz concentrations decreased over time, with
   measurements collected in the 1970s significantly greater than those
   collected later The modeled exposure estimates improve upon duration of
   employment as an estimate of cumulative exposure and reduce exposure
   misclassification due to variation in quartz levels between plants,
   jobs, and over time. Published 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To report on the long-term urinary morbidity among prostate
   cancer patients,vith a prior history of a transurethral resection of the
   prostate (TURP) treated with high-dose 3-dimensional conformal
   radiotherapy (3D-CRT).
   Methods and Materials: Between 1988 and 1997, 1100 patients with
   clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with 3D-CRT. Of these,
   120 patients (8\%) were identified as having had a prior TURP and are
   the subjects of this analysis. The median age was 71 years (range: 49-83
   Sears). The clinical stages of the patients were Tie: 33 (28\%); T2a: 38
   (32\%); T2b: 15 (13\%); and T3: 34 (27\%). Neoadjuvant androgen ablation
   therapy was given to 39 (33 \%). The median radiation dose prescribed to
   the planning target volume was 75.6 Gy (range: 64.8-81 Gy). The median
   elapsed time from TURF to initiation of 3D-CRT was 69 months (range:
   4-360 months). The median follow-up time was 51 months (range: 18-109
   months).
   Results: Five patients of the 120 with a prior history of TURF (4\%)
   developed a urethral stricture after 3D-CRT which was corrected with
   dilatation. The 5-year actuarial likelihood of greater than or equal to
   Grade 2 late urinary toxicities was 9\%. No Grade 4 urinary toxicities
   were observed in this group of patients. Among 110 patients who were
   completely continent of urine prior to 3D-CRT, 10 (9\%) developed stress
   incontinence requiring 1 pad daily for protection or experienced
   occasional leakage (not requiring pad protection). The 5-year incidence
   of greater than or equal to Grade 1 stress incontinence was 18\% in
   patients who developed acute greater than or equal to Grade 2 GU
   symptoms during the course of 3D-CRT compared to 7\% for patients who
   experienced Grade 1 or no acute urinary symptoms (p = 0.05). The
   radiation dose (greater than or equal to 75.6 Gy vs. <75.6 Gy), the
   number of prior TURF procedures, or the volume of resected tissue at the
   time of TURF had no significant impact on the long-term urinary
   morbidity outcome. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that the
   presence of Grade 2 acute urinary symptoms was the only predictor of
   greater than or equal to Grade 1 stress incontinence after 3D-CRT in
   this group of patients.
   Conclusions: Despite prior TURF, the incidence of greater than or equal
   to Grade 3 urinary toxicities is low. Nevertheless, especially among
   patients with a prior history of TURF who experience Grade 2 acute
   urinary symptoms during radiation treatment, a higher risk of stress
   incontinence is observed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of radiation-induced diffuse brain injury was investigated
   using a model of delayed myelination in the irradiated neonatal rat
   brain in which the number of oligodendrocytes decreases without
   associated necrosis of the cerebral white matter. Immunohistochemical
   analysis using antibody against the large myelin-associated
   glycoprotein, a specific marker of oligodendrocytes at an early stage of
   development, showed that the number of the oligodendrocytes associated
   with myelination decreased in the irradiated hemisphere 1 day after
   irradiation and remained low until 5 days after irradiation. In situ
   terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling assay
   revealed that apoptosis mainly occurred in the cerebral white matter of
   the irradiated hemisphere. Three hours after irradiation, apoptotic
   cells were found in the subcortical white matter and the periventricular
   white matter. Six hours after irradiation, apoptotic cells were found in
   the internal capsule, and the numbers of apoptotic cells in the
   periventricular white matter and subcortical white matter increased. One
   day after irradiation, the number of apoptotic cells in the
   periventricular white matter decreased. Three days after irradiation,
   apoptotic cells were not observed in the cerebral white matter. These
   results suggest that the oligodendrocytes associated with myelination
   may be damaged via radiation-induced apoptosis, and depletion of the
   oligodendrocytes may cause delay of myelination.}},

Abstract = {{<(Background)under bar>. Indinavir therapy is associated with a
   continuum of crystal-related syndromes, including nephrolithiasis, renal
   colic, flank pain without recognizable stone formation, dysuria and
   asymptomatic crystalluria. A frank nephropathy has been recognized
   recently as part of the spectrum. <(Methods)under bar>: A retrospective
   analysis of 72 HIV-infected individuals receiving indinavir was
   performed to identify the frequency and risk factors for
   indinavir-associated nephropathy and urinary complications. Individuals
   treated with nucleoside analogues alone served as controls.
   <(Results)under bar>: Mean serum creatinine levels rose from 1.03 +/-
   0.16 mg/dl to 1.11 +/- 0.22 mg/dl at week 12 and 1.15 +/- 0.27 mg/dl at
   week 24 (both, p < 0.01). Thirteen individuals developed serum
   creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dl. Increased serum
   creatinine levels were found more frequently in women (p < 0.01) and
   were associated with pyuria and microhematuria (p < 0.01). Frank renal
   colic and/or nephrolithiasis (seven patients) and urinary pH were not
   associated with serum creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.4
   mg/dl. The mean duration of indinavir treatment, until sterile pyuria
   occurred, were 22 weeks and 32 weeks until the first rise of serum
   creatinine levels to greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dl. Ten patients
   showed both findings, pyuria preceded the first rise in serum creatinine
   levels to greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dl (18 vs. 27 weeks, p =
   0.02). Renal biopsy, done in three patients, revealed tubulointerstitial
   disease with crystals in collecting ducts. In 21 patients, among them 11
   with pyuria, indinavir was replaced for various reasons and pyuria
   disappeared in nine. In these patients mean serum creatinine levels
   decreased from 1.43 mg/dl at withdrawal of indinavir to 1.04 mg/dl three
   months later (p < 0.01). <(Conclusion)under bar>: Indinavir therapy is
   associated with st decrease in renal function which is reversible after
   withdrawal. In addition, indinavir-associated tubulointerstitial disease
   does not seem to be a rare complication. Sterile pyuria in patients
   taking indinavir may help to identify patients being at risk for
   nephrotoxicity.}},

Abstract = {{We report the isolation of a cosmid clone containing the entire human

   this clone to direct tissue-specific expression of human collagen VII in
   transgenic mice was tested The data show that the gene construct is
   capable of directing expression of collagen VII in the skin of fetal and
   neonatal transgenic mice. Expression of COL7A1 in these mice was
   widespread, in a pattern consistent with that found in human tissues and
   was in parallel with that of the endogenous mouse gene. Immunostaining,
   using human-specific antibodies showed that human collagen VII protein
   was present at the skin basement membrane zone of the transgenic mice.
   Dermal extracts from 19-month-old transgenic mice contained mature human
   collagen VII protein, and fibroblasts derived from skin biopsies of
   these mice actively synthesized human collagen VII. The demonstration of
   successful and stable expression of human collagen VII in in vivo gene

Abstract = {{A validation study was performed for a nonlinear computer simulation
   model describing xenobiotic absorption, whole plant allocation, and
   metabolism. Validation involved comparisons of predicted xenobiotic
   behavior with actual data (from independent studies in the literature)
   for the herbicides bentazon, chlorimuronethyl, prosulfuron, rimsulfuron,
   thifensulfuron, clopyralid, picloram, fluroxypyr, imazaquin,
   imazethapyr, acifluorfen, 2,4-D, 2,4-DB, dicamba, haloxyfop-methyl,
   sethoxydim, and pyridate. Simulations were performed with parameters
   describing the plant, the herbicide physicochemical properties, and the
   environmental conditions used in the experimental studies. The
   conformity between simulated and actual absorption, whole plant
   distribution, and metabolism data were evaluated by the ratio of
   simulated values to actual values in 25 species treated with 18
   herbicides from several chemical families such as benzothiadiazole,
   pyridinecarboxylic acid, imidazolinone, diphenyl ether, phenoxyalkanoic
   acid, benzoic acid, aryloxyphenoxypropionate, cyclohexanedione, and
   phenylpyridazine. In general, most predicted values for herbicide
   absorption, whole plant allocation, and metabolism were close to actual
   values for this group of herbicides. Comparisons between model
   prediction and actual herbicide absorption showed that in 79\% of
   comparisons the ratios of predicted/observed were between 0.8 and 1.2.
   For whole plant allocation, 61\% of the comparisons showed a ratio of 1
   +/- 0.3. These results demonstrate the utility of this new computer
   simulation model in predicting xenobiotic behavior in plants and the
   potential use of such models in rational design of herbicide molecules
   for optimal plant uptake and whole plant allocation. (C) 2000 Academic

Abstract = {{Choroidal melanoma has a high mortality rate and responds poorly to
   existing chemotherapy, but unexpected er vivo sensitivity of a subset of
   these tumours to topoisomerase II inhibitors has been noted, Since
   hemoresistance may be mediated by the molecular phenotype of tumours,
   immunohistochemistry has been used to study the expression of both
   isoforms of topoisomerase II (alpha and beta) in 29 choroidal melanomas
   for which chemosensitivity assay data for doxorubicin or mitoxantrone
   are also available. Of these, eight tumours mere topoisomerase II.
   beta-positive and 11 were topoisomerase II alpha-positive, Recent
   studies showing genetic abnormality (often monosomy of chromosome 3) in
   choroidal melanoma suggest that loss of immunostaining could be due to
   genomic loss rather than down-regulation of topoisomerase LI beta in
   these tumours, There mas no convincing excess of anthracycline
   resistance in the topoisomerase II beta-negative group, Addition of
   topoisomerase II alpha, MDR1 (11/17 positive), LRP (16/28 positive), and
   MRP (5/29 positive) data in multivariate analysis did not reliably
   predict sensitivity or resistance, Vincristine chemosensitivity showed
   no relation to MDR1, LRP or MRP in 18 tumours tested, While it is
   possible that some tumours,which do express topoisomerase II beta may
   respond to anthracyclines, the molecular basis of resistance or
   sensitivity to anthracyclines or vincristine in uveal melanoma is
   complex and remains incompletely understood. Copyright (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{Infection of susceptible mice with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis

   nervous system demyelination that is pathologically similar to the human
   disease, multiple sclerosis, We hypothesized that the development of
   neuropathology proceeds down a final common pathway that can be
   accurately quantified within a single spinal cord lesion. To test this
   hypothesis, we conducted quantitative ultrastructural analyses of
   individual demyelinated spinal cord lesions from chronically infected
   mice to determine whether pathological variables assessed within a
   single lesion accurately predicted global assessments of morphological
   and functional disease course, Within lesions we assessed by electron
   microscopy the frequencies of normally myelinated, remyelinated, and
   demyelinated axons, as well as degenerating axons and intra-axonal
   mitochondria, The frequency of medium and large remyelinated fibers
   within a single lesion served as a powerful indicator of axonal
   preservation and correlated with preserved neurological function. The
   number of degenerating axons and increased intra-axonal mitochondria
   also correlated strongly with global measures of disease course, such as
   total lesion load, spinal cord atrophy, and neurological function. This
   is the first study to demonstrate that functional severity of disease
   course is evident within a single demyelinated lesion analyzed

Abstract = {{Objectives: Study objectives were to 1) determine the frequency with
   which laboratory studies are obtained, 2) determine the proportion of
   results that are clinically significantly abnormal, and 3) define the
   clinical characteristics of those with abnormal results, among infants
   with nonfebrile seizures (NFSz).
   Methods: A retrospective consecutive cohort study of infants less than
   or equal to 12 months old presenting to the ED of a tertiary care,
   children's hospital following a seizure. A 2-year review was performed.
   Serum chemistry results were classified as ``normal,{''} ``outside of
   the normal range,{''} or ``clinically significantly abnormal.{''}
   Results: Sixty-seven of 134 (50\%) with a NFSz were tested compared to
   19/80 (24\%) with a febrile seizure (FSz, P < 0.001). Nine (5 with
   hyponatremia and 4 with hypocalcemia) of the 67 (13\%) tested NFSz
   infants had a clinically significant abnormality, as did 9 of 21 (43\%)
   NFSz infants who seized in the ED compared to 0/46 (0\%),Without ED
   seizure activity (P < 0.0001). Hypothermia (T < 36.5 degrees C) and age
   less than I month were common characteristics of infants with clinically
   significant abnormalities.
   Conclusions: This is one of the only studies to have assessed the
   utility of laboratory testing for infants with seizures. Abnormal serum
   chemistries accounted for a greater proportion of seizures among this
   cohort compared to that reported previously for older children.
   Laboratory testing is recommended for NFSz infants who 1) are actively
   seizing in the ED, 2) have a temperature below 36.5 degrees C, or 3) are
   less than 1 month of age.}},

Abstract = {{The purposes of this study were as follows: (1) To determine the
   differences between two- and three-dimensionally calculated energy of
   the athlete in the pole vault. (2) To determine the differences between
   CM energy and total body energy. (3) To examine the influence of these
   different approaches of calculating the athlete's energy on energetic
   parameter values during the pole vault. Kinematic data were gathered
   during the pole vault final of the track and field world championships
   in 1997. Two video cameras (50 Hz) covered the last step of the approach
   including the pole plant and 2 cameras covered the pole phase up to bar
   clearance, respectively. Twenty successful jumps were analysed. The
   characteristics of the energy development is similar for the different
   approaches. Initial energy, energy at maximum pole bend and energy at
   pole release (primary parameters) show significant differences (p <
   0.05). The findings indicate that rotatory movements and movements
   relative to the CM have a larger influence on the primary parameters
   than movements apart from the main plane of movement. For analysing the
   energy exchange between the athlete and the elastic implement pole only
   the differences among the secondary parameters (initial energy minus
   energy at maximum pole bend, final energy minus energy at maximum pole
   bend) are needed (Arampatzis et al., 1997 Biomechanical Research Project
   at the Vth World Championships in Athletics, Athens 1997: Preliminary
   Report. New Studies in Athletics 13, 66-69). For those parameters the
   relative differences between the calculation approaches range only
   between 1.47 and 0.04\%. This indicates that the influence of the
   different approaches for calculating the athlete's energy on the
   analysis of energy exchange is negligible, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Title = {{Cost effectiveness of human immunodeficiency virus postexposure
   prophylaxis for healthcare workers}},
Journal = {{PHARMACOECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The United States Public Health Service (USPHS) published
   recommendations for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) postexposure
   prophylaxis (PEP) of healthcare workers in May 1998. The aim of this
   study was to analyse the cost effectiveness of the USPHS PEP guidelines.
   Design and setting: This was a modelling study in the setting of the US
   healthcare system in 1998. The analysis was performed from the societal
   perspective; however, only HIV healthcare costs were considered and
   health-related losses of productivity were not included.
   Methods: a decision tree incorporating a Markov model was created for 4
   PEP strategies: the current USPHS recommendations, triple drug therapy,
   zidovudine monotherapy or no prophylaxis. A probabilistic sensitivity
   analysis using a Monte Carlo simulation was performed. Confidence
   intervals (CIs) around cost-effectiveness estimates were estimated by a
   bootstrapping method.
   Results: The costs (in 1997 US dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year
   (QALY) saved by each strategy were as follows: monotherapy \$US688 (95\%
   CI: \$US624 to \$US750); USPHS recommendations \$US5211 (95\% CI:
   \$US5126 to \$US5293): and triple drug therapy \$US8827 (95\% CI:
   \$US8715 to \$US8940). The marginal cost per year of life saved was:
   USPHS recommendations \$US81 987 (95\% CI: \$US80 437 to \$US83 689);
   triple drug therapy \$US970 451 (95\% CI: \$US924 786 to \$US 1 014
   429). Sensitivity testing showed that estimates of the probability of
   seroconversion for each category of exposure were most influential, but
   did not change the order of strategies in the baseline analysis. With
   the prolonged HIV stage durations and increased costs associated with
   recent innovations in HIV therapy, the marginal cost effectiveness of
   the USPHS PEP strategy was decreased to \$US62 497/QALY saved. All 3
   intervention strategies were cost effective compared with no
   postexposure prophylaxis.
   Conclusions: Current USPHS PEP recommendations are marginally cost
   effective compared with monotherapy, but the additional efficacy of
   triple drug therapy for all risk categories is rewarded by only a small
   reduction in HIV infections at great expense. For the foreseeable
   future, assuming innovations in therapy that employ expensive drug
   combinations earlier in the HIV disease course to extend life expectancy
   and the increasing prevalence of HIV drug resistance, our model supports
   the use of the USPHS PEP guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{Bedside hearing screenings are routinely conducted by speech and

   Cognitive deficits resulting from brain injury, however, may interfere

   attention deficits often compromise patient abilities to follow
   procedural instructions. This article describes the effects of jointly
   applying behavioral methods and psychophysical methods to improve two
   severely brain-injured survivors' attending and reporting on auditory
   test stimuli presentation. Treatment consisted of stimulus control
   training that involved differentially reinforcing responding in the
   presence and absence of an auditory test tone. Subsequent hearing
   screenings were conducted with novel auditory test tones and a common
   titration procedure. Results showed that prior stimulus control training
   improved attending and reporting such that hearing screenings were
   conducted and estimates of auditory thresholds were obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Herpes Viruses have been implicated in the etiology of Hodgkin's disease
   (HD). We studied the prevalence of human cytomegalovirus (CMV), human
   herpes viruses type-6 (HHV-6), type-7 (HHV-7) and type 8 (HHV-8) DNA in
   up to 88 Hodgkin's disease biopsies in comparison to Epstein-Barr virus
   (EBV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Non-Hodgkin lymphomas
   (NHL) and reactive lesions served as controls. CMV and HHV-6 were found
   in 8/86 (9\%) and 11/88 (13\%) HD cases, respectively, by nested primer
   PCR. Except for three cases harbouring HHV-6 type-B, only HHV-6 type-A
   was detected in HD. HHV-7 was observed by nested PCR in 33/88 (38\%) HD
   cases and was already detectable in 15/88 (17\%) HD cases by a
   single-round PCR indicating elevated virus copy numbers. Seven of these
   cases showed co-infection with HHV-6, and 11 cases were found to contain
   EBV DNA. 7/8 CMV-positive HD cases also harboured EBV DNA. HHV-8 DNA was
   not detected by single round or nested PCR in any HD case investigated.
   Thus, CMV, HHV-6, and HHV-7 were present in small proportions of HD
   cases, with frequent co-infection of HHV-6 and HHV-7, and frequent
   association with EBV. In contrast to EBV, beta-herpes viruses are
   therefore unlikely to have a role in the aetiology of HD. Rather, the
   presence of these viruses seems to reflect impaired immunological
   surveillance. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Root rot, caused by Fusarium solani f.sp. phaseoli, is a serious disease
   of bean for which successful control has been elusive. Genetic
   resistance to the pathogen is considered quantitative and is strongly
   influenced by environmental factors. To reduce environmental variation
   and facilitate selection in earlier generations, an accurate,
   consistent, and nondestructive greenhouse screen was developed for the
   evaluation of Fusarium root rot resistance in bean. We describe a
   protocol that involves the germination of seedlings in perlite,
   inoculation of roots and hypocotyls 10 days after planting and
   evaluation within 4 weeks. The accuracy of this greenhouse screen was
   confirmed by demonstrating significant correlations between greenhouse
   and field ratings. Two experiments that included 24 and 21 diverse bean
   genotypes, respectively, were performed in the greenhouse and the
   ratings were correlated with field ratings over two growing seasons.
   Correlation coefficients between the greenhouse and field ratings were
   significant and as high as 0.99, Numerous genotypes can be evaluated
   within a short time for relatively minimal costs and labor. Furthermore,
   once roots have been rated and dipped in fungicide, plants can be
   transplanted for production of seed. This simple, rapid, and inexpensive
   protocol reduces environmental variation inherent to field ratings,
   thereby more accurately representing physiological resistance while
   maintaining a close association with observed field ratings.}},

Abstract = {{Fanconi's anaemia (FA) shows great variability in phenotypic symptoms.
   We report on two FA siblings of German ancestry with the very rare form
   of the complementation group FA-D. Both presented with a similar
   phenotype and mild disease severity but with different growth. In the
   sister, growth velocity was normal, puberty and menarche occurred
   spontaneously. Her final height was within her parental target height.
   The younger brother had a reduced growth velocity, height SDS values
   below -5.5 SDS, a markedly retarded bone age, and delayed puberty. At
   the age of 12.9 years, growth hormone deficiency (GHD) was diagnosed and
   treatment with growth hormone was initiated. Our cases emphasize the
   heterogeneity of symptoms in FA even in siblings with the same genotype.
   In FA-children with severe growth retardation, GHD must also be
   considered. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We have directly imaged the dynamic behavior of a variety of
   morphologically different peroxisomal structures in HepG2 and COS-7
   cells transfected with a construct encoding GFP bearing the C-terminal
   peroxisomal targeting signal 1. Real time imaging revealed that moving
   peroxisomes interacted with each other and were engaged in transient
   contacts, and at higher magnification, tubular peroxisomes appeared to
   form a peroxisomal reticulum, Local remodeling of these structures could
   be observed involving the formation and detachment of tubular processes
   that interconnected adjacent organelles. Inhibition of cytoplasmic
   dynein based motility by overexpression of the dynactin subunit,
   dynamitin (p50), inhibited the movement of peroxisomes in vivo and
   interfered with the reestablishment of a uniform distribution of
   peroxisomes after recovery from nocodazole treatment. Isolated
   peroxisomes moved in vitro along microtubules in the presence of a
   microtubule motor fraction. Our data reveal that peroxisomal behavior in
   vivo is significantly more dynamic and interactive than previously
   thought and suggest a role for the dynein/dynactin motor in peroxisome

Abstract = {{In view of the restricted system knowledge and data availability as well

   agroecology is not a trivial problem. For most problems different

   to be a promising tool, Opportunities and limitations of the neural
   network paradigm in agroecological modelling are critically discussed.
   Two neural network applications, in habitat quality and biomass growth
   modelling, exemplify different application aspects. To improve the
   applicability of neural networks, input data pre-processing and the

Abstract = {{An extremely unusual level of coastal upwelling in the spring and summer
   of 1999 over much of the California Current system (CCS) is described,
   based on direct and indirect observations. Wind and ocean anomalies in
   1999, a period characterized by an equatorial La Nina, are compared to
   climate trends for the previous several years, and specifically
   contrasted with the extremes associated with the 1997-98 El Nino event.
   Conditions in the CCS during the spring and summer of 1999) were
   consistent with extremely high levels of sustained coastal upwelling.
   The Pacific Fisheries Environmental Laboratory (PFEL) upwelling indices
   reached record highs fur a series extending back to 1946. Strong,
   sustained upwelling-favorable winds were measured at coastal buoys
   through late 1998 and much of 1999. Coastal sea-surface temperatures
   (SSTs) were 3 degrees -4 degreesC below their seasonal mean in spring
   1999, and about 10 degrees cooler than the region experienced in late
   1997. Hydrographic surveys of central California suggest upwelling of
   water by 100 m or more relative to the long-term spring average. Coastal
   sea-level (CSL) anomalies ill the northern CCS were the lowest in at
   least 65 years. Greater than usual southward transport by the California
   Current is implied. A number of population and ecological changes
   observed during this period may be linked to the unusual ocean
   conditions and the striking transition from El Nino to La Nina. Physical
   conditions in the CCS can change swiftly and dramatically, and its
   marine populations appear to respond nearly as rapidly. The large
   physical and biological changes that occurred in 1999 may signify the
   initiation of a new climate regime for the CCS.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms linking acinar cell apoptosis and ductal epithelial
   proliferation remain unknown. To determine the relationship between
   these events, pancreatic duct ligation (PDL) was performed on p53(+/+)
   and p53(-/-) mice. In mice bearing a wild-type p53 allele, PDL resulted
   in upregulation of p53 protein in both acinar cells and proliferating
   duct-like epithelium. In contrast, upregulation of Bcl-2 occurred only
   in duct-like epithelium. Both p21(WAF1/CIP1) and Bax were also
   upregulated in duct-ligated lobes. After PDL in p53(+/+) mice, acinar
   cells underwent widespread apoptosis, while duct-like epithelium
   underwent proliferative expansion. In the absence of p53, upregulation
   of p53 target genes and acinar cell apoptosis did not occur. The absence
   of acinar cell apoptosis in p53(-/-) mice also eliminated the
   proliferative response to duct ligation. These data demonstrate that
   PDL-induced acinar cell apoptosis is a p53-dependent event and suggest a
   direct link between acinar cell apoptosis and proliferation of duct-like
   epithelium in duct-ligated pancreas.}},

Abstract = {{The organic derivatives of sodium and potassium are generally insoluble
   in hydrocarbons while their instability in ethers, for example,
   precludes long-term storage of solutions and thus restricts their wider
   application. Addition of magnesium 2-ethoxyethoxide produces
   hydrocarbon-soluble reagents with reactivity comparable with that of the
   simple organometallics. The organoalkali-metal reagents in the presence
   of magnesium 2-ethoxyethoxide in tetrahydrofuran become almost inert
   towards cleavage of the solvent while retaining organoalkali-metal-like
   metallation characteristics. The metallating ability of organolithium
   reagents can be modified by addition of suitable metal alkoxides, Mixed
   alkali-metal dialkylaminoalkoxides combine the activating properties of
   an alkoxide with those of a tertiary amine, while magnesium
   2-ethoxyethoxide greatly reduces the metallating ability and unwanted
   side reactions can be avoided. Certain allylic or benzylic organolithium
   reagents, in the presence of mixed lithium potassium
   dialkylaminoalkoxides, and in some cases also of magnesium
   2-ethoxyethoxide, add either stoichiometrically or catalytically to
   ethylene to produce mono- or poly-ethylated derivatives. In this way
   substantial quantities of interesting sterically demanding aromatic
   derivatives have been produced in good yield. Copyright (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{Background and objective. Defects of the frontal skull base can be
   reconstructed with different types of material. Homologous material
   possibly involves the risk of infection and thus complicated wound
   healing. Therefore, alloplastic material seems to be an interesting
   alternative.
   Patients/Methods. In the present paper, we report on a series of 45
   patients who underwent reconstruction of the anterior skull base. The
   defects were localized in different regions and had a maximum diameter
   of 10 cm(2). Of the defects, 39 were closed via a sandwich technique and
   12 via an onlay. The rhinosurgical approaches were aimed at closing the
   defects with Ethisorb(C), a resorbable collagen texture, and supporting
   the surgical field with a balloon catheter from below. Postoperative
   controls were performed after 6 weeks (endoscopy, determination of beta
   (2)-transferrin) and 6 months (CT scans).
   Results. All defect reconstructions were stable and tight, i.e., neither
   a CSF leakage nor a meningoencephalocele was found. The healing was
   completely normal and the endoscopic controls showed a regular mucosal
   lining over the defects.
   Conclusions, We conclude that Ethisorb(C) is a useful alternative
   material in the treatment of frontal skull base defects.}},

Abstract = {{In murine tumor cell lines, downregulation of MHC class I surface
   expression has been frequently detected, but the underlying molecular
   mechanisms of such deficiencies have not been defined. In this study,
   murine tumor cell lines of different histology derived from spontaneous
   or from chemical-induced tumors were analyzed for the expression of
   multiple components of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
   I antigen-processing machinery (APM), including the peptide transporter
   TAP, the interferon (IFN)-gamma inducible proteasome subunits and
   several chaperones. The tumor cell lines analyzed demonstrated a
   heterogeneous expression pattern of various APM components. In
   comparison to control cells an impaired coordinated expression of at
   least three APM components was detected. In particular, extensive APM
   deficiencies were found in cell lines derived from chemical-induced
   tumors. A strong coordinated downregulation of expression and/or
   function of TAP, the low molecular weight proteins (LMP) subunits, the
   proteasome activator PA28 and/or tapasin was found in 5 of 10 tumor
   cells, which was associated with impaired MHC class I surface
   expression. In contrast, the expression of beta (2)-microglobulin (beta
   (2)-m), PA28 beta, the constitutive proteasome subunits X, Y, Z and of
   the chaperones calnexin, calreticulin, ER60 and phospho disulfide
   isomerase (PDI) was unaltered or only weakly decreased. The deficient
   expression of APM components could be corrected by IFN-gamma treatment,
   which also reconstituted MHC class I surface expression. However,
   impaired expression of APM molecules appears not to be the only cause of
   abnormal MHC class I expression, since it could neither be corrected by
   the addition of exogeneous MHC class I binding peptides nor by
   incubation at low temperature. These results suggest that one major
   mechanism of murine tumor cells, in particular chemical-induced tumors,
   to evade the immune system is the combined dysregulation of various APM
   components and other factors, which still have to be identified.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate an analytic model to compute the non-linear power
   spectrum of dark matter, galaxies and their cross-correlation. The model
   is based on Press-Schechter haloes, which cluster and have realistic
   dark matter profiles. The total power spectrum is a sum of two
   contributions, one from correlations between the haloes and one from
   correlations within the same halo. We show that such a model can give
   dark matter power spectra which match well with the results of N-body
   simulations, provided that the concentration parameter decreases with
   the halo mass.
   The galaxy power spectrum differs from the dark matter power spectrum
   because the pair-weighted number of galaxies does not scale with the
   halo mass and because most haloes harbour a central galaxy. If the
   pair-weighted number of galaxies increases less rapidly than the halo
   mass, as predicted by theoretical models and observed in clusters, then
   the resulting power spectrum becomes a power law with a slope close to
   the observed over several orders of magnitude in scale. Such a model
   also predicts a later onset of non-linear clustering in comparison with
   dark matter, which is needed to reconcile the cold dark matter (CDM)
   models with the data. A generic prediction of this model is that bias is
   scale-dependent and non-monotonic. This is particularly important for
   red or elliptical galaxies, which are preferentially found in larger
   mass haloes and for which the bias in the power spectrum may be
   scale-dependent even on large scales.
   Our predictions for galaxy-dark matter correlations, which can be
   observed through galaxy-galaxy lensing, show that these cannot be
   interpreted simply as an average halo profile of a typical galaxy,
   because different halo masses dominate at different scales and because
   larger haloes host more than one galaxy. We compute predictions for the
   cross-correlation coefficient as a function of scale and discuss the
   prospects of using cross-correlations in combination with galaxy
   clustering to determine the dark matter power spectrum.}},

   chemical reactions are enhanced. Numerical modelling is undertaken to
   determine the spatio-temporal evolution of cavitation bubbles. The
   calculus of the emergence of cavitation bubbles due to the acoustic
   driving (by taking into account interactions between the sound field and
   bubbles' distribution) gives a cartography of bubbles' emergence within
   the reactor. Computation of their motion induced by the pressure
   gradients occurring in the reactor show that they migrate to the
   pressure nodes. Computed bubbles levitation sites gives a cartography of
   the chemical activity of ultrasound. Modelling of stable cavitation
   bubbles' motion induced by the motion of the liquid gives some insight

Abstract = {{Genetic adaptation of wild populations to captivity can be a problem for

   control. We examine how the life history of Drosophila melanogaster, the
   most commonly used organism for laboratory studies of evolution, evolves
   in response to two common methods of laboratory culture: in bottles and
   in population cages. We collected flies at the same site in nature at
   the same time of year in three consecutive years and compared freshly
   collected populations from the third collection with the products of 1
   or 2 yr's laboratory culture, in a replicated experimental design.
   Preadult development time increased in the laboratory, particularly in
   cage culture. There was also an increase in larval competitive ability
   in both types of culture. Body size was little affected, increasing
   slightly and only in the bottle culture. Early fecundity increased in
   bottle culture, while late fecundity declined. Adult mortality rates
   were lowest in the fresh collections and showed a marked and progressive
   increase in bottle culture with a slight increase in population cage
   culture and apparently only in the first year of culture. Remating
   frequency increased in bottle but not cage culture. These evolutionary
   changes are most likely explained by increased larval competition in
   laboratory culture, especially in population cages, and by truncation of
   the adult period in the bottle culture, resulting in natural selection
   acting solely on the early part of the adult period.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Platelet concentrates (PCs) derived from whole blood and
   stored under standard blood bank conditions undergo changes that are
   referred to as the platelet storage lesion. This study assesses the
   effect of PC preparation and storage on the distribution of
   phosphatidylserine (PS) in the platelet membrane and the effect that
   this distribution may have on the thrombogenic potential of stored PCs.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Fresh platelets and PCs donated by healthy
   donors were obtained. PCs derived from platelet-rich plasma were studied
   on Day 1, Day 3, and Day 6 of storage under blood bank conditions.
   RESULTS: Platelet aggregation after exposure to the platelet agonists
   ADP and epinephrine singly declined progressively, but, when ADP and
   epinephrine in combination and collagen and thrombin in combination were
   used as agonists, the decline in platelet aggregation was less marked.
   PS expression as measured by Annexin V binding (mean and SD) was 2.02
   +/- 0.93 percent in fresh platelet samples and increased to 5.39 +/- 4.2
   percent on Day 1, 22.1 +/- 7.1 percent on Day 3, and 39.5 +/- 12.1
   percent on Day 6. Platelet prothrombinase activity (mean +/- SD) as
   measured by thrombin generation increased from 1.49 +/- 0.7 mu per mL in
   fresh platelet samples to 3.68 +/- 1.1 mu per mL in Day 1 platelets
   (p<0.001), 5.15 +/- 2.5 mu per mL in Day 3 platelets (p<0.001), and 4.65
   +/- 2.48 mu per mL in Day 6 platelets (p<0.001).
   CONCLUSION: These results show that PS expression increases after
   preparation of PCs from platelet-rich plasma and rises progressively
   during platelet storage under blood bank conditions. Furthermore, the
   greater PS expression is associated with increased platelet-dependent
   thrombin-generating capacity.}},

Abstract = {{A growing number of firms have begun work toward the development of

Abstract = {{In this paper, the electrical and optoelectrical properties of some
   polymeric materials have been reported for their potential applications
   in photovoltaic and organic light emitting diodes. The thin films of the
   organic polymers were made over the indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass
   substrates by spin coating technique using suitable solvent. The
   metallic electrodes were deposited on the top of organic layer to make
   their respective sandwiched configuration. Formation of schottky barrier
   and ohmic contacts in the devices have been investigated by measuring
   the current - voltage (J-V) characteristics in dark. Additionally, the
   comparison of the photoaction spectra of the devices with the optical
   spectra of the thin film layer or polymeric materials verify the nature
   of the contacts. The ohmic conduction and space charge limited current
   (SCLC) conduction either with single trap level or exponential
   distribution of traps, have been discussed.
   One way to achieve higher energy conversion efficiency and carrier
   collection efficiency is to dope the polymers so that the efficient
   charge separation occurs at the interface boundaries. It is found
   experimentally that doping with appropriate dopants brings an adequate
   change in the optical and electrical properties of the organic
   materials. Chemical doping using acceptor type molecules with high
   electron affinity and donor type molecules with low ionisation energies
   reduces the electrical resistance as well as the thermal activation
   energies and increases the photoconductivity. The doping with acceptor
   type molecules also increases the energy conversion efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Aim-To review the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and visual
   outcome in patients with non-contact lens related Acanthamoeba keratitis
   and compare the findings with reported series of contact lens associated
   Acanthamoeba keratitis.
   Methods-Medical and microbiology records of 39 consecutive patients with
   a diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis, at a tertiary eyecare centre in
   India between January 1996 and June 1998, were analysed retrospectively.
   Results-A majority of the patients presented with poor visual acuity and
   large corneal stromal infiltrates (mean size 38.20 (SD 26.18) mm). A
   predisposing factor was elicited in 19/39 (48.7\%) patients (trauma 15,
   dirty water splash three, leaf juice one). None of the patients had worn
   contact lenses. Most patients (26/39 (66.6\%)) came from a low
   socioecononnic background. Complaint of severe pain was not a
   significant feature and radial keratoneuritis was seen in 1/39 (2.5\%)
   patients. A ring infiltrate was present in 41.1\% of cases. A clinical
   diagnosis of fungal keratitis was made in 45\% of the patients before
   they were seen by us. However, all patients were diagnosed
   microbiologically at our institute based on demonstration of
   Acanthamoeba cysts in corneal scrapings (34/39) and/or culture of
   Acanthamoeba (34/39). Treatment with biguanides (PHMB, 15/38 (39.4\%),
   PHMB with CHx, 23/38 (60.5\%), one patient did not return for treatment)
   resulted in healing with scar formation in 27 out of 31 (87.0\%)
   followed up patients (mean time to healing 106.9 days). Overall visual
   outcome was poor with no statistical difference between cases diagnosed
   within 30 days (early) or 30 days after (late) start of symptoms. The
   visual outcome in cases requiring tissue adhesive (five) and
   keratoplasty (three) was also poor.
   Conclusions-This is thought to be the largest series of cases of
   Acanthamoeba keratitis in non-contact lens wearers. In such cases, the
   disease is advanced at presentation in most patients, pathognomonic
   clinical features are often not seen, disease progression is rapid, and
   visual outcome is usually poor. Possible existence of Acanthamoeba
   pathotypes specifically associated with non-contact lens keratitis and
   unique to certain geographical areas is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of skewed X-inactivation in normal women is controversial,
   with up to 10-fold differences being reported by different authors. In
   order to clarify this issue, we have conducted a survey of the
   X-inactivation patterns in 270 informative females from various age
   groups, using the androgen receptor gene/polymerase chain reaction
   assay. Results obtained by using DNA extracted from blood samples show
   that the incidence of severe skewing (defined here as ratios greater
   than or equal to 90:10) is relatively common and increases with age
   (P<0.05), occurring in 7\% of women under 25 years of age, and 16\% of
   women over 60. In order to study tissue-specific patterns of
   X-inactivation, samples of both buccal and urinary epithelia were also
   obtained from 88 of the females studied. Although there was a
   significant association of the X-inactivation ratios between each tissue
   in most individuals, wide variations were apparent in some cases, making
   accurate extrapolations between tissues impossible. The degree of
   correlation between each tissue also fell markedly with age. Our data
   are consistent with the hypothesis that the major factors in the
   aetiology of skewed X-inactivation are secondary selection processes.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 107 putative ericoid mycorrhizal endophytes were isolated

   known ericoid mycorrhizal endophytes and selected ascomycetes. The
   majority of endophyte isolates (62-92 \%) from each site were identified
   as Hymenoscyphus ericae, but a number of other less common mycorrhizal
   RFLP types were also identified, all of which appear to have strong
   affinities with the order Leotiales. None of the less common RFLP types
   was isolated from C. vulgaris at more than one field site.

   the sum of L = \#\{internal lines of psi\} and L' = \#(external lines of

   THEOREM A If k is defined by k = \textbackslash{}psi\textbackslash{} -
   theta (n-1), then
   L + L' = phi (n-1) + k(k - 1)/2.
   (The generalization of this to subsets of PG(n, 3) is also obtained.)
   Let S be a partial spread of lines in PG(4, 2) and let N denote the
   number of reguli contained in S. Use of Theorem A gives rise to a simple
   proof of:
   THEOREM B If S is maximal then one of the following holds:

   possibility (ii) is realized by precisely three projectively distinct
   types of partial spread. Explicit examples are also given of four

Abstract = {{This paper examines some of the issues that arise when seeking to tackle
   health inequalities in a context of limited health care resources.
   Increasingly, central agencies are using devolved budgets for health
   care providers as a central instrument of expenditure control. Equity
   objectives play an important role in the resource allocation methods
   used to determine such budgets. Yet, unless integrated into a proper
   system of risk management, the use of budgets can lead to serious
   inequity. The paper discusses the potential contributions of different
   disciplines to promoting equity within a health care budgetary regime.

Abstract = {{Thrombosis resulting from blood platelet aggregation via glycoprotein
   (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor activation triggers the local release of
   vasoactive substances. Therefore, inhibition of these receptors could
   affect coronary vasoactive function during thrombotic coronary
   arteriostenosis. Twenty pigs were instrumented with an aortic catheter
   and with hydraulic occluders and flow probes on both the left anterior
   descending (LAD) and the left circumflex (LCx) coronary arteries. One of
   these 2 coronary arteries was repeatedly injured by external clamping
   for 15-second periods at 30-minute intervals while the pigs were given
   either a GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor (L-739,758) (n=5), heparin
   (n=5), aspirin (n=3), or saline (n=7). There were no baseline
   differences between the 4 groups in mean arterial pressure, resting
   coronary blood flow (CBF), or reactive hyperemic response (RHR), which
   was induced by brief coronary artery occlusion and expressed as flow
   debt repayment. After multiple injuries, resting CBF had decreased by
   95+/-2\% (ie, nearly complete coronary artery occlusion) at 15+/-4
   minutes in the control group, whereas in the heparin-, aspirin-, and GP
   IIb/IIIa inhibitor-treated groups, resting CBF had decreased by only
   21+/-7\% at 18+/-3 minutes, 15+/-3\% at 18+/-5 minutes, and 15+/-7\% at
   21+/-4 minutes, respectively, suggesting that heparin, aspirin, and the
   GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor each prevented injury-induced coronary artery
   occlusion. After the initial injury, the RHR was progressively reduced
   in the control and heparin- and aspirin-treated groups but not in the GP
   IIb/IIIa inhibitor-treated group. At a comparable level of resting CBF
   (approximate to 15\% below baseline), the RHR was reduced more in the
   control (-56+/-9\%), heparin-treated (-49+/-9\%), and aspirin-treated
   (-61+/-12) groups (P<0.05) than in the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor-treated
   group (-26+/-6\%). When the resting CBF had decreased by <approximate
   to>35\%, the RHR still was reduced significantly more (P<0.01) in the
   heparin-treated group (-64+/-9\%) than in the GP IIb/IIIa
   inhibitor-treated group (-21+/-6\%). In a separate group of control pigs
   (n=4) subjected to 2 injuries, coronary perfusion pressure distal to the
   injury site was reduced by 14+/-1 mm Hg from the arterial pressure, and
   the RHR was 20+/-6\%. When the distal coronary perfusion pressure was
   reduced similarly (-14+/-1 mm Hg) in a separate group of GP IIb/IIIa
   inhibitor-treated pigs (n=4) by 2 injuries and the use of a hydraulic
   occluder, the RHR was 130+/-16\% (P<0.01 versus control). Our data
   demonstrate for the first time that a platelet GP IIb/IIIa receptor
   inhibitor can preserve the distal coronary vasodilatory response during
   progressive coronary arteriostenosis.}},

Abstract = {{The recently cloned retinal cone Na+-Ca2+-K+ exchanger (NCKX) was
   expressed in cultured insect cells, and whole-cell patch clamp was used
   to measure transmembrane currents generated by this transcript and
   compare them with currents generated by retinal rod NCKX or by a
   deletion mutant rod NCKX from which the two large hydrophilic loops were
   removed. We have characterized the ionic currents generated by both the
   forward (Ca2+ extrusion) and reverse (Ca2+ influx) modes of all three
   NCKX proteins. Reverse NCKX exchange generated outward current that
   required the simultaneous presence of both external Ca2+ and external
   K+. Forward NCKX exchange carried inward current with Na+, but not with
   Li+ in the bath solution. The cation dependencies of the three NCKX
   tested (external K+, external Na+, internal Ca2+) were very similar to
   each other and to those reported previously for the in situ rod NCKX.
   These findings provide the first electrophysiological characterization
   of cone NCKX and the first electrophysiological characterization of
   potassium-dependent Na+-Ca+ exchangers in heterologous systems. Our
   results demonstrate the feasibility of combining heterologous expression
   and biophysical measurements for detailed NCKX structure/function

Abstract = {{Whole-cell recording in the superficial layers of the developing

   postsynaptic neuron can abolish this drop. The regulation is induced
   prematurely by 1-2 hr of electrical stimulation in pig collicular slices
   only if CaN and NMDAR currents can be activated in the neuron. These
   data suggest that a long-lasting, CaN-mediated control of NMDAR kinetics
   is rapidly initiated by heightened activity of the NMDAR itself and
   demonstrate a novel developmental and tonic function of CaN that can

Abstract = {{We use the finite size scaling method to study the critical points,

   to expand the exact eigenfunction of a given molecular Hamiltonian. To
   illustrate this approach, we give detailed calculations for systems of
   one electron and two nuclear centres, Z(+)e(+)Z(+). Within the
   Born-Oppenheimer approximation, there is no critical point, but without
   the approximation the system exhibits a critical point at Z = Z(c) =
   1.228 279 when the nuclear charge, Z, varies. We show also that the
   dissociation occurs in a first- order phase transition and calculate the
   various related critical exponents. The possibility of generalizing this
   approach to larger molecular systems using Gaussian basis sets is

Abstract = {{This study was designed to determine whether the level of retinoblastoma
   protein (pRb) expression predicts tumor progression and prognosis in

   pRb loss and overexpression were observed in 5 (13.5\%) and 18 (48.6\%)
   of the 37 tumors, respectively. Both pRb loss and overexpression were
   significantly correlated with advanced TNM stage, lymph node metastasis,
   and tumor perineural invasion. Moreover, pRb overexpression was
   significantly associated with decreased overall survival (P = 0.001;
   log-rank test), Further analysis indicated that the influence of pRb
   overexpression on survival was independent of TNM stage and lymph node
   metastasis, Loss of p16(INK4) protein was observed in 28 of the 37 GBCs
   (75.7\%), but was not significantly associated with any
   clinicopathological factors or survival, pRb overexpression was
   significantly associated,vith the loss of p16(INK4) protein (P <

Abstract = {{Water level data at 16 ground water wells and two sea water gauging
   stations, coupled with barometric measurements in an alluvial plain in
   the central-west region of Taiwan, are analyzed using spectral analysis
   in the time and frequency domains. The semi-diurnal component from water
   level station is observed to be the most noticeable signal while the
   diurnal component is the less distinct signal recorded at the water
   level stations. Both semidiurnal and diurnal components are coupled with
   atmospheric pressure measurements. From the atmospheric pressure data,
   spectral analysis indicates that both the raw and the pressure adjusted
   water levels are almost in phase and retain the same amplitude in this
   area. It implies that the effect of pressure variations is not
   significant for the sea water and ground water level nearby; the
   astronomical tidal components, as expected, are the main factor causing
   fluctuation of ocean water and ground water levels in the Choshuihsi
   alluvial plain.}},

Abstract = {{Four human cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) allelic variants were purified
   from membranes of Escherichia coli in which respective CYP1B1 cDNAs and
   human NADPH-P450 reductase cDNA have been introduced. Purified CYP1B1
   variants were used to reconstitute 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation
   activities with purified rabbit liver or recombinant (rat) NADPH-P450
   reductase in the phospholipid vesicles and compared with those catalyzed
   by CYP1B1 enzymes in the membranes of E. coli in monocistronic (by
   adding the reductase) and bicistronic (without addition of extra
   reductase) systems. In the bicistronic system, the ratio of expression
   of NADPH-P450 reductase to CYP1B1 proteins was found to range from 0.2
   to 0.5. Purified CYP1B1 enzymes (under optimal reconstitution
   conditions) catalyzed 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation at rates one-third
   to one-fourth of those catalyzed by membranes of E. coli coexpressing
   CYP1B1 and the reductase proteins. Full catalytic activities in
   reconstituted systems were achieved with a twofold molar excess of
   NADPH-P450 reductase to CYP1B1; in membranes of E. coli with the
   monocistronic CYP1B1 construct, an eightfold molar excess of reductase
   to CYP1B1 was required. However, in membranes of bicistronic constructs,
   there was no additional stimulation of 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation
   by extra NADPH-P450 reductase, despite the fact that the molar ratio of
   expression levels of reductase to CYP1B1 was <0.5. These results suggest
   that NADPH-P450 reductase produced in the bacterial membranes is more
   active in interacting with CYP1B1 proteins in the bicistronic system
   than the reductase added to artificial phospholipid vesicles or
   bacterial membranes, (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional numerical simulations have been carried out in order
   to explain the experimental results with a shock-tube-driven disk
   magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) generator with inlet swirl for the first

   obtained numerically is higher than that in the experiment, for seed
   fractions lower than the optimum value. There may exist some additional
   mechanism causing a total pressure loss which cannot be included in the
   present numerical model. The radial component of Mach number becomes
   less than unity for high seed fractions. This decrease in Mach number is
   not so steep but moderate, and seems to be different from that
   attributed to a shock wave observed in a fluid now without MHD
   interaction. Plasma structure is almost uniform in the theta direction
   near the optimum conditions, Under the condition far from the optimum
   value, however, a nonuniform and unsteady plasma structure owing to the
   partial ionization of seed material is observed.}},

Abstract = {{Suicide gene therapy utilizing the herpes simplex thymidine kinase
   (HSVtk)/ganciclovir (GCV) system has been performed to kill cancer
   cells. However, the low transduction efficiency of HSVtk gene into
   cancer cells critically limits its efficacy in cancer treatment in
   clinical situations. To improve delivery of the HSVtk gene into cancer
   cells, we transduced U-87MG and U-373MG glioma cells with adenovirus
   (Adv) vectors with a fiber mutant, F/K20, which has a stretch of 20
   lysine residues added at the C-terminus of the fiber, for the HSVtk gene
   (Adv-TK-F/K20), and compared the cytopathic effect of AdV-TK-F/K20 with
   that of the Adv for HSVtk with wild-type fiber (Adv-TK), The cytopathic
   effect of AdV-TK-F/K20 in U-87MG and U-373MG cells was approximately 140
   and 40 times, respectively, stronger than that of Adv-TK, At the same
   multiplicity of infection (MOI) in each cell line, Adv-TK-F/K20 induced
   a higher degree of apoptosis (U-87MG, 35\%; U-373MG, 77\%) than Adv-TK
   (U-87MG, 0.11\%; U-373MG, 27\%) in U-87MG (MOI 0.03) and U-373MG cells
   (MOI 0.1), Cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) was more marked
   in the cells that were infected with Adv-TK-F/K20 than in cells that

Abstract = {{Reducing moire is an important consideration in CRT design. This paper
   aims to investigate how the visibility of the inverse-phase raster
   moire, a typical pattern of the raster moire, is influenced by the
   distribution of the electron beam and the structure of shadow mask
   apertures. First, a simple model based on the luminance distribution on
   the CRT screen and characteristics of the human vision was used to
   calculate the perceived intensity of the inverse-phase raster moire.
   This calculation was made to examine the effect of model parameters. It
   showed that the inverse-phase raster moire consists of (1,1)-order moire
   components. It was also found that the perceived intensity increases
   with a decrease in electron beam diameter and with an increase in
   horizontal aperture pitch. In addition, a subjective evaluation test was
   conducted using an inverse-phase moire pattern reproduced by the image
   simulation. Test results agreed with the calculated results. Finally, it
   was revealed that when an electron beam shape having a Gauss
   distribution was used, most of the raster moire is the inverse-phase
   raster moire caused by the (1,1)-order component, while the (2,2)-order
   moire component was very low.}},

Abstract = {{The brown treesnake (Boiga irregularis) is a species of special
   management concern, requiring improvement of capture methods through the
   development of effective artificial lures. Toward this end, we used
   night-vision cameras and mechanical models to study the interplay of
   sensory modalities for stimulating predatory behavior in brown
   treesnakes. Snakes oriented toward live mouse (Mus musculus) lures in
   complete darkness as much as they did to live mice lures under
   visible-light illumination; however, brown treesnakes in an unlighted
   environment responded qualitatively differently by probing and biting at
   the lure holder rather than striking at the mouse within las did snakes
   in lighted trials). We altered the odors and vibratory cues of
   mechanical models to partition attractive stimuli and to measure snake
   response to vibratory cues. Fur-covered odorized (by rubbing with
   freshly defrosted dead neonatal mouse) models were more attractive than
   fur-covered non-odorized models, odor alone, and empty lure holders.
   Brown treesnake response to live mice did not differ from their response
   to smooth, odorized models, and moving versions of the smooth, odorized
   models stimulated more predatory behavior than unmoving models. Response
   from brown treesnakes appears to increase as odor and mechanical
   vibration stimuli are increased quantitatively and-or qualitatively
   Conceptually, we hypothesize that polymodal stimuli synergize to promote
   predatory behavior in foraging snakes and that for trapping purposes, a
   multi-sensory attractant, optimized at each modality will be required to
   achieve capture success similar to or better than that obtained using
   live mice lures.}},

Abstract = {{A generalized impedance boundary condition (GIBC) is developed to
   approximate the scattering of a plane acoustic wave from a bone
   structure such as a rib. In particular, the rib and surrounding tissue
   are modeled as a viscoelastic cylinder of infinite length immersed in an
   infinite, inviscid fluid medium, In order to determine the scattered
   pressure wave, appropriate boundary conditions are imposed on the
   relevant differential equations at the fluid-solid surface. The exact
   solution is then used to develop first- and second-order impedance
   boundary conditions applicable at the surface of the cylinder. Numerical
   results demonstrate the improved accuracy of the second order condition.}},

Abstract = {{Runaway/homeless shelters document high levels of substance abuse among
   runaway youth, at least double that of school youth. These youth present
   a constellation of problems and research suggests that this population
   may be unique in the range and intensity of associated problems. Most
   studies to date have collected self-report data on these youth;
   virtually no research has examined treatment effectiveness with the
   population. Given the void of treatment outcome research with these
   youths, there is need for identifying potent interventions. Given that
   issues of engagement and retention must assume prominence in the
   development of new treatments, this article presents a family-based
   treatment engagement strategy successfully employed with a sample of
   substance-abusing youth staying in a southwestern shelter. Youth and
   primary caretakers are engaged separately by the therapist utilizing
   motivating factors appropriate to context of the families' lives and to
   the developmental position of the client. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that inflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor
   necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) may play a role in heart disease.
   Elevated plasma levels of the cytokine have been reported in congestive
   heart failure and severe angina and after myocardial infarction. The
   exact role of TNF-alpha in heart disease and how production is
   stimulated and regulated in the heart are current areas of
   investigation. Regarding regulation of production, isoproterenol
   elevates cyclic AMP and inhibits TNF-alpha release in macrophages.
   Therefore we hypothesized that stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors
   of the sympathetic nervous system would inhibit release of the cytokine
   from heart tissue. With Institutional Review Board approval and patient
   consent atrial tissue was obtained during preparation for cardiac
   bypass. The tissue was divided into segments, placed in culture medium,
   and incubated for various times in the presence or absence of
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (20 mu g/mL) and/or isoproterenol (1 mu M). The
   medium was removed and analyzed for biologically active TNF-alpha by the
   L929 cell cytotoxicity assay. Tissue samples were weighed and TNF-alpha
   release was expressed as pg TNF-alpha/mg tissue. Initially, to determine
   the time course of release, measurements were made at 2, 5, 10, 15, 30,
   60, 120, 180, and 360 minutes after the addition of LPS. Elevated
   TNF-alpha levels in the culture medium were reliably detected at 360
   minutes after exposure to LPS. In atrial tissue obtained from seven
   patients TNF-alpha released into the culture medium at 360 minutes was 6
   +/- 3 pg/mg tissue. In the presence of LPS, levels of the cytokine in
   the culture medium increased to 604 +/- 233 pg/mg tissue (P < 0.05 vs
   LPS alone). When isoproterenol and LPS were simultaneously added to the
   culture medium release of TNF-alpha was reduced by 87 per cent to 82 +/-
   40 pg/mg tissue (P < 0.05 vs LPS alone), Our results show that
   activation of the beta-adrenergic receptor inhibits myocardial
   production of TNF-alpha. This finding suggests that the sympathetic
   nervous system inhibits production of the cytokine and that impaired
   sympathetic function in heart failure may play a role in the elevated
   levels of TNF-alpha.}},

Abstract = {{To characterize the expression and possible regulation of reductive
   dehalogenation in halorespiring bacteria, a 11.5-kb genomic fragment
   containing the o-chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase-encoding cprBA
   genes of the gram-positive bacterium Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans was
   subjected to detailed molecular characterization. Sequence analysis
   revealed the presence of eight designated genes with the order
   cprTKZEBACD and with the same polarity except for cprT. The deduced cprC
   and cprK gene products belong to the NirI/NosR and CRP-FNR families of
   transcription regulatory proteins, respectively. CprD and CprE are
   predicted to be molecular chaperones of the GroEL type, whereas cprT may
   encode a homologue of the trigger factor folding catalysts, Northern
   blot analysis, reverse transcriptase PCR, and primer extension analysis
   were used to elucidate the transcriptional organization and regulation
   of the cpr gene cluster. Results indicated halorespiration-specific
   transcriptional induction of the monocistronic cprT gene and the
   biscistronic cprBA and cprZE genes. Occasional read-through at cprC
   gives rise to a tetracistronic cprBACD transcript, Transcription of
   cprBA was induced 15-fold upon addition of the o-chlorophenolic
   substrate 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid within 30 min with
   concomitant induction of dehalogenation activity. Putative regulatory
   protein binding motifs that to some extent resemble the FNR box were
   identified in the cprT-cprK and cprK-cprZ intergenic regions and the
   promoter at cprB, suggesting a role for FNR-like CprK in the control of
   expression of the cprTKZEBACD genes.}},

Abstract = {{In order to study the effects of different local anaesthetics with and
   without vasoconstritor (epinefrine), 20 adult crossbred cows were used.
   The following treatments were carried out:T-1 - control (bidistilled
   water); T-2 - chloridrate of lidocaine (20 mg/ml) with epinephrine
   (0.005 mg/ml); T-3 - chloridrate of lidocaine (20 mg/ml) with
   epinephrine (0.02 mg/ml); T-4 - chloridrate of lidocaine (20 mg/ml) with
   epinephrine (0.05 mg/ml); T-5 - chloridrate of lidocaine(20 mg/ml); T-6
   - chloridrate of procaine (22 mg/ml) with epinefrine (0.02 mg/ml); T-7 -
   chloridrate of procaine (22 mg/ml). The different solutions were
   injected, at the same time, into the subcutaneous space of the medial
   chest line, 10cm apart of all cows. Observation at the infiltration
   sires was made 72 hours later, for the presence or not of tissue
   reaction, as well as lesion degrees. No differences were found among
   T-1, T-5, T-6, and T-7, which did not cause tissue reaction. On the
   other hand, lower lesion tissue degrees were found in cows treated with
   T-2 as compared to T-3 and T-4. It can be concluded that the use of both
   local anaesthetics alone or chloridrate of procaine with epinefrine are
   harmless to the skin while chloridrate of lidocaine associated with any
   concentration of vasoconstritor may give rise to tissue lesions in
   cattle.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous work, Lu29-024
   (2,5-dimethyl-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1-methyl-4-piperidinyl)-1H-indole),
   a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist with nanomolar affinity and high
   selectivity, was labeled with carbon-11 to evaluate its behavior as a
   potential PET ligand for the serotonergic 5-HT2A receptor in the central
   nervous system. Administration of this tracer to rats was followed by a
   good brain uptake, no brain labeled metabolites but no specific,
   regio-selective, binding at 20 and 40 min post injection. Despite this,
   the data noted at 20 and 40 min suggest that this tracer, if associated
   with a radioactive emitter with a longer half-life than that of
   carbon-11, could be useful for the quantification of 5HT(2A) receptors.
   For these reasons, we chose to label this compound, bearing a fluorine
   atom, with {[}F-18]fluoride, in order to perform rat studies over a more
   prolonged time-scale. The pre cursor for the radiosynthesis of
   {[}F-18]Lu29-024 was obtained in an overall yield of 20\% by a
   multi-step synthesis including an acetonylation reaction followed by a
   Fisher indole reaction. The radiotracer was prepared by an aromatic
   substitution with activated {[}F-18]fluoride followed by a
   decarbonylation reaction that employed Wilkinson's catalyst. The
   radiosynthesis of {[}F-18]Lu29-024 required approximatively 110 min with
   an overall radiochemical yield of 20-35\% and specific activities of
   37GBq/mu mol. Fluorine-labeled Lu29-024 may thus be envisaged as a
   potentially useful PET tracer that can be applied to a wide range of
   neurological and psychiatric diseases. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Nonlinear dynamics of radiation-induced oscillatory instability in
   diffusion flames is numerically investigated by employing a diffusion
   flame established in stagnant mixing layer with optically thin gas-phase
   radiation and unity Lewis numbers for all species as a model. Particular
   attention is focused on the radiation-induced extinction regime that
   occurs when the Damkohler number is sufficiently large. Transient
   evolution of the flame, initiated by imposing a Damkohler number
   perturbation on the steady solution, exhibits three types of
   flame-evolution behaviors, namely decaying oscillatory solution,
   diverging solution to extinction, and stable limit-cycle solution. The
   locus of the critically perturbed Damkohler number, across which
   diverging solutions are separated from decaying solutions or limit-cycle
   solutions, is obtained, and it can be used as a dynamic extinction
   boundary for laminar flamelet library. The bifurcation structure is
   found to be a double Hopf bifurcation, involving a supercritical Hopf
   bifurcation and a subcritical Hopf bifurcation. The stable limit-cycle
   solutions, which occur only in the radiation-induced extinction regime
   while not observed in the transport-induced extinction regime, are found
   in a small island-shaped parametric region of Damkohler number and flame
   temperature, in which the double Hopf bifurcation exists, with
   perturbation amplitudes smaller than the amplitude of the unstable limit
   cycle of the subcritical Hopf bifurcation. The stable limit-cycle
   behavior is implied to be relevant to the remarkably sustainable
   droplet-flame oscillations observed in the space shuttle experiment. (C)

   techniques for inguinal herniorrhaphy in the ambulatory setting. We
   randomly assigned 81 consenting outpatients to receive IHNB-MAC general
   anesthesia, or spinal anesthesia. We evaluated recovery times, 24-h
   postoperative side effects and associated incremental costs. Compared
   with general and spinal anesthesia, patients receiving IHNB-MAC had the
   shortest time-to-home readiness (133 +/- 68 min vs 171 +/- 40 and 280
   +/- 83 min), lowest pain score at discharge (15 +/- 14 mm vs 39 +/- 28
   and 34 +/- 32 mm), and highest satisfaction at 24-h follow-up (75\% vs
   36\% and 64\%). The total anesthetic costs were also the least in the
   IHNB-MAC group (\$132.73 +/- 33.80 vs \$172.67 +/- 29.82 and \$164.97

Abstract = {{A numerical study on the thermomechanical behavior of aluminum matrix
   composite with NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) reinforcement under
   uniaxial tension is performed. The simulation is based on the
   micromechanics model established recently by the authors. The influence
   of the shape and volume fraction of SMA inclusions on the overall
   behavior of the aluminum composite as well as on the internal stress
   evolution is quantitatively investigated. The strengthening effect of
   the SMA on the aluminum matrix is illustrated. The results obtained
   demonstrate several interesting features of the composite and may serve
   as a quantitative reference for the microstructure design of this
   composite in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Hantaan (HTN) virus, the etiologic agent of clinically severe
   hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), was first isolated in 1976
   from lung tissues of striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius) captured in
   Songnae-ri, Kyungki-do, Korea. To clarify the genetic diversity and
   phylogenetic relationship among Korean strains of HTN virus, viral
   sequences of the partial S and M segments were amplified from lung
   tissues of 24 seropositive striped field mice captured between 1989 and
   1998 at 11 sites in South Korea. The 771-nucleotide (nt) S segment
   sequences (coordinates 432 to 1202) of HTN virus strains from Yangju-kun
   differed by 10 to 40 nt (1.3 to 5.2\%) from virus strains from
   Pocheon-kun, Songnae-ri and Nonsan-kun. Similar degrees of genetic
   variation were found in the G1 and G2 glycoprotein-encoding M segment.
   Phylogenetic trees, based on the partial S and M segments and generated
   by the maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods, demonstrated that
   virus strains from various geographic regions in South Korea showed a
   tendency to form two phylogenetic subgroups and were evolutionarily
   distinct from HTN virus strains from the People's Republic of China.}},

Abstract = {{A turbulent boundary layer that separates, reattaches, and redevelops
   over a smoothly contoured ramp and a downstream Aat plate has been
   examined. In order to resolve the flow in the viscous sublayer, a
   custom-built, two-dimensional LDA with a very high resolution was used.
   A small separation bubble occurred over the trailing edge of the ramp.
   The <(v'v')over bar> and <(u'v')over bar> Reynolds stress components
   increased rapidly in the adverse pressure gradient boundary layer, and
   developed large outer layer peaks aligned with the inflection point in
   the mean velocity profile. The high stress levels were nearly unchanged
   by the reattachment process, decaying only after the mean velocity
   profile recovered and outer-layer production dropped. A key feature is
   that the inner layer recovered relatively quickly to a typical turbulent
   boundary layer in the redeveloping region, while the outer layer
   recovery was retarded by the large eddies generated in the separation
   region. (C) 2000 Begell House Inc. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

Abstract = {{Purpose: We compared techniques for analyzing visually evoked potential
   (VEP) asymmetry in children with albinism to find one that could be used
   effectively and efficiently. Method: Subjects included 21 child
   volunteers, ages 10 months to 6 years (control group) and 21 children
   with albinism, ages 2 months to 6 years (albinism group). Five-channel
   flash VEP was performed on all subjects. Electrodes were positioned at
   0z, 01, 02, 03, and 04 (10/20 system), Data were analyzed by use of
   techniques previously described. These included inspection of the VEP
   waveforms, measurement of hemispheric waveform parameters, calculation
   of an asymmetry index, and use of a bipolar derivation between left and
   right hemispheric responses (interhemispheric difference potential). In
   addition, we quantified the interhemispheric difference potential by use
   of Pearson's correlation coefficient. Measurements of sensitivity and
   specificity determined the success of the 5 analysis paradigms. The
   accuracy of each paradigm represented the ability to classify the data
   according to volunteer or albinism group and is derived from both
   sensitivity and specificity measures. Results: Measurement of
   hemispheric differences in VEP waveform parameters was the least
   sensitive measure method for detecting multichannel VEP asymmetry in
   albinism, Comparison of left and right eye interhemispheric difference
   potential increased accuracy to 67\%, Nonquantitative inspection of
   waveform demonstrated an accuracy of 76\%, The asymmetry index and
   Pearson's correlate measure yielded accuracy rates of 79\% and 83\%,
   respectively. Conclusion: The efficiency and capability of Pearson's
   correlate measure in quantifying interhemispheric difference potentials
   to detect albinotic misrouting makes this a useful and practical
   technique in a pediatric clinic.}},

   has a hidden truth value by virtue of vaguenes, it increases the
   plausibility of epistemicism. Epistemicism says that vague statements
   have hidden truth values. If a precise statement can have a hidden truth
   value conferred indirectly by vagueness, then a vague statement can have
   a hidden truth value directly by its own vagueness.}},

Abstract = {{A putative hybrid zone between flightless carabid beetles, Carabus
   (Ohomopterus) insulicola and C. (O.) arrowianus nakamurai in the Ina
   Valley central Honshu, japan, was studied using experimental
   hybridization and morphological analysis. The principal morphological
   character analysed was a functional part of the male genitalia (the
   copulatory piece), which is also the key diagnostic character in
   taxonomy. The habitat of the carabid beetles is fragmented hv the Tenryu
   River, which runs through the Ina Valley: and its tributaries.
   Ohomopterus insulicola and O. a. nakamurai occur in the upstream and
   downstream areas of the river basin, respectively, and a putative hybrid
   swarm (O. insulicola ssp. pseudinsulicola) is found in the boundary area
   on the east side of the Tenryu River. Experimental hybridization between
   O, insulicola and O. a. nakamurai resulted in F-1 offspring that were
   morphologically similar to O. i. pseudinsulicola. Pre-zygotic
   reproductive isolation was incomplete, although the F-1 males had a
   dysfunction in sperm production and were almost sterile. Only a single
   F-1 pair produced F-2. Backcrosses of F-1 females of males of the
   parental species resulted in offspring that were similar to the parental
   species in genital morphology. Based on the discriminant function for
   the shape of the copulatory piece resulting from the experimental
   hybridization, we demonstrate that similar hybrid swarms exist on both
   sides of the Tenryu River, but in locations 25 km apart. This
   demonstrates parallelism in hybridization events with similar
   consequences. The hybrid swarms consisted of beetles with intermediate
   morphological characters and did not contain obvious parental forms. The
   establishment of such intermediate populations may have been facilitated
   by selection for fertile hybrids in segregated local sites in the
   absence of frequent immigration of parental species. This study suggests
   that a segmented river basin provides an opportunity for establishing
   novel evolutionary lineages resulting from hybridization. (C) 2000 The

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: We report an unusual case of basal ganglia
   granulomas caused by Candida albicans that surrounded the proximal
   segment of a nonfunctional cerebrospinal fluid shunt in a previously
   healthy patient.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 22-year-old woman had undergone
   ventriculoatrial cerebrospinal fluid shunt placement for posttraumatic
   hydrocephalus 3 years previously. One year later, a shunt revision was
   followed by wound dehiscence with local infection at the neck level. She
   received oral administration of antibiotics for 3 months until the wound
   closed. Twelve weeks before admission, the patient experienced pulmonary
   emboli. She received anticoagulants, and the distal segment of the shunt
   was removed. Five weeks after shunt removal, she presented with headache
   and left-sided hemiplegia caused by right basal ganglia inflammatory
   masses.
   INTERVENTION: A stereotactic brain biopsy was performed, and the shunt
   remnants were removed. Microscopically, the lesions were acutely and
   chronically inflamed. C. albicans grew in tissue and in shunt hardware
   cultures. The patient was treated with 1.1 g of intravenously
   administered amphotericin B and orally administered ketoconazole; she
   recovered completely.
   CONCLUSION: C. albicans brain granulomas occur rarely in immunocompetent
   patients. Despite the large size of the lesions and severe brain edema,
   the absence of an underlying disease contributed to complete resolution
   after shunt removal and antifungal therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, SiGe HBT BiCMOS technology has matured from a
   laboratory research effort to become a 50/60-Ghz f(T)/f(max)
   silicon-based 0.5-mum BiCMOS production technology. This progress has
   extended silicon-based production technology into the multigigahertz
   (multi-GHz) and multigiabits-per-second (multi-Gb/s) range, thus,
   opening up an array of wireless and wired circuit and network
   applications and markets. SiGe circuits are now being designed in the
   same application space as GaAs MESFET and HBTs, and offer the yield,
   cost, stability and manufacturing advantages associated with
   conventional silicon fabrication.
   A wide range of microwave circuits have neem built in this technology
   including 5.8-GHz low-noise amplifiers with l-V supply, up to 17-GHz
   fully monolithic VCOs with excellent figures of merit, high-efficiency
   2.4-GHz power devices with supply voltage of 1.5 V, and more complicated
   functions such as 2.5/5.0-GHz frequency synthesizer circuits as well as
   10/12.5-Gb/s clock and data recovery PLLs. This paper focuses on several
   key circuit applications of SiGe BiCMOS technology and describes the
   performance improvements that can be obtained by its utilization in
   mixed-signal microwave circuit design. By way of examples, the article
   highlights the fact that the combination of high-bandwidth, high-gain
   and low-noise SiGe HBTs with dense CMOS functionality in a SiGe BiCMOS
   technology enables implementation of powerful single-chip transceiver
   architectures for multi-GHz and multi-Gb/s communication applications.}},

   the periocular region and their rate of recurrence after surgical
   excision}},

Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this study was to assess clinical and histologic
   features of primary basal cell carcinomas of the periocular region and
   to calculate the rate of recurrence of these tumors after surgical
   excision without intraoperative frozen section control.
   Methods: All primary basal cell carcinomas of the periocular region
   which were treated by surgical excision at the University Eye Hospital
   and Clinic of Ulm between 1993 and 1998 were reviewed and special
   attention was paid to age and sex of the patient and localization and
   histology of the tumor. The recurrence rates were calculated depending
   on whether the margins were free or involved on histologic examination
   of the excised specimens.
   Results: We could include 137 patients with 141 tumors into this study.
   In 92 patients with 95 tumors, follow-up data of at least 3 months was
   available with a mean follow-up period of 31.3 months. The mean age of
   the patients was 68.9 years, range 28.7-91.3 years. The tumor was
   located at the lower eyelid, medial canthus, upper eyelid and lateral
   canthus in 63.1\%, 29.8\%, 5.7\% and 1.4\%, respectively. The solid
   (53.9\%) and the solid-cystic (17.7\%) type were the most common
   encountered histology followed by the mixed type with sclerosing foci
   (12.1\%) and the morphea or sclerosing type (10.6\%). A free margin on
   histologic examination was achieved in only 47.6\% of cases. The overall
   recurrence rate was 9.5\% {[}definite recurrences: 6 cases (6.3\%);
   questionable recurrences: 3 cases (3.2\%)]. With histologically complete
   excision the recurrence rate was only 2.3\% (1 case) and in the case of
   an incomplete excision definite recurrent tumors were observed in 11.8\%
   (6 cases) and questionable recurrences in 3.9\% (2 cases) of cases
   during the follow-up period.
   Conclusions: Surgical excision of basal cell carcinomas of the
   periocular region without utilizing intraoperative frozen section
   control or Mohs' micrographic surgery is associated with a high rate of
   positive tumor margin on histologic examination. However, our study
   showed that this is only infrequently followed by local recurrences.
   This result may raise the question whether simple surgical excision is
   still an option in the case that more cumbersome methods such as Mohs'
   micrographic surgery or intraoperative frozen section control are not
   available. However, with positive tumor margin on histologic examination
   of the excised tissue or with the presence of a sclerosing type regular
   follow-up is mandatory.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the susceptibility of late-stage chicken embryos to

   Intravenous inoculation of MDV 1 at embryonic day (ED) 16 resulted in

   of virus exposure, pp38 viral antigen (pp38) was detected in embryonic
   bursae and MDV 1 was isolated by plaque assay from the spleens,
   thymuses, and bursae of embryos. The pathogenesis of MDV 1 after
   intravenous inoculation at ED 16 was similar to that in chicks exposed
   to MDV 1 after hatching. In contrast to the response of the embryo to
   intravenous inoculation, embryos exposed to MDV 1 by the amniotic route
   did not develop detectable pp38, nor could the virus be isolated from
   the embryonic tissues by plaque assay. These results show that the route

Abstract = {{In a double-blind randomized study, the incidence and severity of

   Germany) compared with propofol for induction of a balanced anaesthesia

   The incidence and intensity of nausea was examined by use of a visual
   analogue scale (VAS; 0-100 mm) at 1, 2, between 6 and 8, and 24 h
   postoperatively. One-hundred-and-sixty-four patients undergoing
   orthopedic procedures were studied. For etomidate vs. propofol, 14.6\%
   vs. 14.2\% male and 26.8\% vs. 27.5\% female patients were nauseated
   during the first two postoperative hours. The median rating for nausea
   remained below 5 mm at any time in both groups, i.e. the intensity of
   nausea was very low. The incidence of vomiting was higher in women
   receiving etomidate (26.8\% vs. 10\%).

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study was to assess the importance of physical
   activity performed both in occupational settings and in leisure time on
   the risk of colorectal cancer, considering the possible confounding
   effects of dietary habits. The hospital-based case-control study was
   carried out in Poland. In total, 180 incident cases of colorectal cancer
   were recruited. An equal number of controls, individually matched by
   gender and age, were chosen from patients with no history of cancer. A
   food frequency questionnaire combined with quantity of foods eaten was
   used to assess the usual dietary pattern for 148 food items. The average
   physical load of the interviewed patients before the occurrence of
   disease was ascertained by self-assessment. The degree to which
   patients' recreational time was sedentary was measured by the number of
   hours spent watching TV. The adjusted risk of colorectal cancer was
   reduced by half in those active in leisure time (OR 0.45, 95\% CI
   0.24-0.84). The effect of occupational physical activity was of about
   the same order of magnitude in terms of risk reduction (OR 0.61, 95\% CI
   0.29-1.29) and both activities combined acted as independent protective
   factors. The protective effect of healthy nutrition appeared to be
   independent from that attributed to physical effort. (C) 2000 Lippincott

Abstract = {{Occupational medicine physicians are frequently asked to establish
   cancer causation in patients with both workplace and non-workplace
   exposures. This is especially difficult in cases involving beryllium for
   which the data on human carcinogenicity are limited and controversial.
   In this report we present the case of a 73-year-old former technician at
   a government research facility who was recently diagnosed with lung
   cancer. The patient is a former smoker who has worked with both
   beryllium and asbestos. He was referred to the University of California,
   San Francisco, Occupational and Environmental Medicine Clinic at San
   Francisco General Hospital for an evacuation of whether past workplace
   exposures may have contributed to his current disease. The goal of this
   paper is to provide an example of the use of data-based risk estimates
   to determine causation in patients with multiple exposures. To do this.
   we review the current knowledge of lung cancer risks in former smokers
   and asbestos workers, and evaluate the controversies surrounding the
   epidemiologic data linking beryllium and cancer. Based on this
   information, we estimated that the patient's risk of lung cancer from
   asbestos was less than his risk from tobacco smoke, whereas his risk
   from beryllium was approximately equal to his risk from smoking. Based
   on these estimates, the patient's workplace was considered a probable
   contributing factor to his development of lung cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic orthostatic intolerance is often related to the postural
   orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). POTS is characterized by
   upright tachycardia. Understanding of its pathophysiology remains
   incomplete, but edema and acrocyanosis of the lower extremities occur
   frequently. To determine how arterial and venous vascular properties
   account for these findings, we compared 13 patients aged 13-18 yr with
   10 normal controls. Heart rate and blood pressure were continuously
   recorded, and strain-gauge plethysmography was used to measure forearm
   and calf blood flow, venous compliance, and microvascular filtration
   while the subject was supine and to measure calf blood flow and calf
   size change during head-up tilt. Resting venous pressure was higher in
   POTS compared with control (16 vs. 10 mmHg), which gave the appearance
   of decreased compliance in these patients. The threshold for edema
   formation decreased in POTS patients compared with controls (8.3 vs.
   16.3 mmHg). With tilt, early calf blood flow increased in POTS patients
   (from 3.4 +/- 0.9 to 12.6 +/- 2.3 ml 100 ml(-1) min(-1)) but did not
   increase in controls. Calf volume increased twice as much in POTS
   patients compared with controls over a shorter time of orthostasis. The
   data suggest that resting venous pressure is higher and the threshold
   for edema is lower in POTS patients compared with controls. Such
   findings make the POTS patients particularly vulnerable for edema fluid
   collection. This may signify a redistribution of blood to the lower
   extremities even while supine, accounting for tachycardia through vagal
   withdrawal.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure is described which allows the characterization of enzyme by
   a hybrid approach using an enzyme and an antibody. The presented method
   is related to the affinity determination of antibodies by the `affinity
   in solution' procedure for BIAcore. The antibody is used as an indicator
   for the concentration of substrate, which is also the antigen. A mixture
   of enzyme, substrate and antibody is incubated, and an aliquot of this
   solution is injected periodically into a flowcell containing immobilized
   substrate, which is bound by the antibody, but not cleaved by the
   enzyme. The chosen initial concentration of substrate inhibits the
   binding of antibody to the immobilized substrate by 90\%. During the
   enzymatic reaction, increased amounts of antibody bind to the surface,
   as the substrate concentration is decreased. With this method, the
   cleavage of creatinine with creatinine iminohydrolase (6 mU/ml) was
   monitored for up to 11 h. A recently developed monoclonal antibody
   against creatinine was used as the indicating protein. For the
   calculation of enzyme activity, the signals were compared with a
   calibration curve for inhibition of antibody binding to the chip by
   creatinine in solution. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights

Abstract = {{We describe the expression of EphA3 and EphA7 receptors and ephrin-A2
   ligand in the retina and the superior colliculus during the development
   of the retinocollicular projection in the marsupial wallaby (Macropus
   eugenii), using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. EphA3 in the
   retina was in a striking, low central to high peripheral gradient,
   superimposed on which was a high temporal to low nasal level of
   expression. This distribution was evident from postnatal day 30, when
   axons are growing into the colliculus and forming a coarsely organized
   topographic projection, to postnatal day 65, when axons have arborized
   in their correct retinotopic positions. EphA7 showed a shallow
   centroperipheral gradient with no nasotemporal differences in
   expression. In the superior colliculus no rostrocaudal differences in
   distribution were detected for either of these receptors. Ephrin-A2 was
   distributed in a gradient increasing from the rostral to the caudal pole
   in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus only up to
   postnatal day 30. Ephrin-A2 was evenly distributed in the retina
   throughout development of the projection. Expression of EphA3 in the
   retina increased, while the expression of ephrin-A2 in the colliculus
   was downregulated over time. The graded expression of EphA3 and
   ephrin-A2 early in the development of the projection suggests that they
   play a role in establishment of coarse topography of retinal axons along
   the rostrocaudal axis of the superior colliculus. However, the gradients
   were not complementary, meaning that EphA3 alone cannot mediate the
   repulsive interactions with ephrin-A2 that have been postulated to
   underlie formation of the topographic map.}},

Journal = {{MARINE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The effects of cadmium exposure and dietary status on cadmium
   accumulation, fatty acid (FA) content and profiles were investigated in
   two colour forms of the shore crab Carcinus macnas. Groups of shore
   crabs were either starved or fed with blue mussels, Mytilus edulis,
   during a 40 d exposure period to 2 or 6 muM Cd2+ (as CdCl2). Starved
   green individuals accumulated more cadmium in haemolymph and
   hepatopancreas than did red crabs and green crabs fed during the
   experiments. In the red colour form, no difference in cadmium
   accumulation was observed between starved and fed individuals. In both
   colour forms, hepatopancreas contained more FA than gills and muscle.
   The FAs often present in the largest amounts in the tissues were 16.0,
   16:1 omega7, 18:1 omega7, 18:1 omega9, 20:4 omega6, 20:5 omega3 and 22:6
   omega3. However, saturated (SAFA) and mono-unsaturated fatty acids
   (MUFAs) were dominant in hepatopancreas. whereas poly-unsaturated fatty
   acids (PUFAs) were dominant in gills and muscles. At the beginning of
   the experiment, the total FA content in the hepatopancreas was 111.6 mg
   g(-1) (dry weight) for red crabs and 78.4 mg g(-1) for green shore
   crabs. During the experiment, however, the FA content decreased in red
   crabs. This decrease was more pronounced for starved individuals than
   for fed individuals. Also, the decrease in FA content was more
   pronounced in crabs exposed to 6 muM cadmium compared to crabs exposed
   to 2 muM or crabs not exposed to cadmium. No change in FA content was
   observed in green shore crabs, irrespective of diet and cadmium
   exposure. For both colour forms, no change in FA content was observed
   for gills and muscle. In red crabs, a decrease was observed for all FAs
   in the hepatopancreas. This decrease, however, was more pronounced for
   SAFAs and MUFAs than for PUFAs, indicating that the metabolism of FAs
   during starvation and cadmium exposure is selective. The experiments
   indicate that green colour forms of shore crabs are more tolerant of
   natural stress such as starvation and anthropogenic stress, e.g. cadmium
   exposure, than are red colour forms of shore crabs.}},

Abstract = {{A vessel geometry plays an important role in a molten metal motion
   caused by a quasi-sinusoidal magnetic field. The characteristics of the
   motion have been studied by comparing the free surface motion of a
   molten metal in a rectangular vessel with those in a square and a
   cylindrical ones. The theoretical expressions of Lorentz force and a
   magnetic pressure, which are induced by imposing a quasi-sinusoidal
   magnetic:field on a molten metal in a rectangular vessel, have been
   derived. It has been found in all the three vessels with different
   geometrical shapes, a periodical oscillation motion and an irregular
   motion predominate the surface motions in a low and a high frequency
   ranges, respectively.}},

Year = {{2000}},

Abstract = {{Dequalinium (DECA) is a potent antitumor agent and inhibitor of protein
   kinase C (PKC). Previously it was shown that PKC alpha activity in vitro
   could be irreversibly inhibited when treated with DECA at low micromolar
   concentrations and irradiated with 366 nm of light. This approach was
   used to probe the role of intracellular PKC activity in the motility of
   metastatic murine melanoma B16 F10 cells and as a target for DECA
   analogs with increasing PKC inhibitory potencies. Pretreatment of a
   monolayer of B16 F10 cells with 250 nM of a DECA analog in the presence
   of UV irradiation for 5 min resulted in 1) complete inhibition of cell
   motility for up to 4 h in a time-lapse motility assay and 40 to 60\%
   inhibition of cell migration in a Boyden chamber, and 2) inhibition by
   40 to 60\% of intracellular phosphatidylserine/Ca(2+)-dependent PKC
   catalytic activity, signifying inactivation of a conventional PKC
   isoform. Because PKC alpha is the only conventional PKC isoform detected
   in B16 F10 cells, a stably transfected clone expressing a
   kinase-defective mutant of PKC alpha was developed that exhibited a
   substantial loss of adhesion and motility and was refractory to further
   inhibition by DECA. These findings identify PKC alpha catalytic activity
   both as a mechanistic component of cell motility and adhesion and as a
   critical intracellular target of DECA. These studies further suggest
   that the combined use of UV with nanomolar concentrations of DECA offers
   an effective chemotherapeutic approach to inhibit metastatic behavior of
   melanoma cells.}},

Abstract = {{Conceptual design has profound impact on success of a product design.
   Identification of the best conceptual design candidate is a crucial step
   as design information is not complete and design knowledge is minimal at

   reasoning. The method consists of the following steps: (1) acquisition
   of customer needs and ranking of their importance, (2) establishment of
   measurable metrics and their relations with customer needs, (3)
   development of design specifications and initial evaluation of design
   candidates, and (4) evaluation and identification of design candidates
   based on design specifications and customer needs using neural
   network-based fuzzy reasoning. A case study is given to show the
   effectiveness of the proposed method and associated algorithms. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Geographers have recently argued that labour-market regulation interacts
   with market forces in profoundly different ways in different local
   labour markets. We illustrate this argument by using the case of the new
   statutory minimum wage in Britain. We consider whether the introduction
   of the national minimum wage represents a genuine departure from the
   preceding neoliberal labour-market regime, and examine how far it will
   begin to redress some of the pronounced geographical inequality in wages
   across local labour markets which developed under that regime. To
   provide comparative context, we examine the international geography of
   minimum wages and assess whether, and to what extent, the new UK minimum
   wage indicates a shift towards a new model of labour-market governance
   and regulation. We then review the geography of low pay in the United
   Kingdom and consider the possible geographical impact of the new
   national minimum wage. We argue that the effects of the minimum will
   vary depending on the nature of local labour-market characteristics.
   Then, perhaps most contentiously, the case is considered for regionally
   differentiating the minimum wage to reflect geographical differences in
   the cost of living. Finally, we examine the arguments for and against a
   single uniform national minimum in the light of administrative systems
   operated in other countries.}},

Title = {{Significance of commissural calcification on outcome of mitral balloon
   valvotomy}},
Journal = {{HEART}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{398-402}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective-To evaluate the significance of commissural calcification,
   identified by transthoracic echocardiography, on the haemodynamic and
   symptomatic outcome of mitral balloon valvotomy.
   Methods-Commissural calcification was graded from 0-4 using parasternal
   short axis transthoracic views. The morphology of the mitral valve was
   also assessed using the Massachusetts General Hospital echo score.
   Setting-A tertiary cardiac centre in Scotland.
   Patients-300 patients were studied, 85 retrospectively and 215
   prospectively. Mean (SD) age was 59.8 (12.7) years, range 13 to 87; 30\%
   had been judged unsuitable for surgery. Median echo score was 6.8 (3.0),
   range 2-16.
   Main outcome measures-Immediate increase in mitral valve area and in New
   York Heart Association functional class 1-3 months after balloon
   valvotomy.
   Results-On univariate and multivariate analysis, commissural
   calcification grade was a significant predictor of achieving a mitral
   valve area of > 1.50 cm(2) without seven mitral reflux. Its influence
   was greatest in patients with an echo score less than or equal to 8:
   those with commissural calcification grade 0/1 had significantly greater
   improvement in valve area and symptom status than those with grade 2/3;
   the proportions of patients achieving a final valve area of > 1.50 cm(2)
   were 67\% and 46\%, respectively (p < 0.05). In patients with an echo
   score of > 8, the influence of commissural calcification was smaller and
   not significant.
   Conclusions-Commissural calcification as assessed by transthoracic
   echocardiography is a useful predictor of outcome in patients with
   otherwise ``good{''} valves (echo score less than or equal to 8).
   Calcification of one commissure or mon predicts a less than 50\%
   probability of achieving a Valve area above 1.50 cm(2) and is an
   indication for valve replacement in those who are suitable for surgery.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method for selecting entire microbial ecosystems for
   bioremediation and other practical purposes. A population of ecosystems
   is established in the laboratory, each ecosystem is measured for a
   desired property (in our case, degradation of the environmental
   pollutant 3-chloroaniline), and the best ecosystems are used as
   `parents' to inoculate a new generation of `offspring' ecosystems. Over
   many generations of variation and selection, the ecosystems become
   increasingly well adapted to produce the desired property, The procedure
   is similar to standard artificial selection experiments except that
   whole ecosystems, rather than single individuals, are the units of
   selection. The procedure can also be understood in terms of complex
   system theory as a way of searching a vast combinatorial space (many
   thousands of microbial species and many thousands of genes within
   species) for combinations that are especially good at producing the
   desired property, Ecosystem-level selection can be performed without any
   specific knowledge of the species that comprise the ecosystems and can
   select ensembles of species that would be difficult to discover with
   more reductionistic methods. Once a `designer ecosystem' has been
   created by ecosystem-level selection, reductionistic methods can be used
   to identify the component species and to discover how they interact to
   produce the desired effect.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: We examined the indication of upper mediastinal lymphadenectomy for
   a squamous cell carcinoma of the lower thoracic oesophagus.
   Methods: 49 patients underwent a curative oesophagectomy with upper
   mediastinal lymphadenectomy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the lower
   thoracic oesophagus. Node status and clinicopathological characteristics
   of these patients were reviewed retrospectively.
   Results: 16 (94.1\%) of 17 patients with superficial tumours had no
   positive node in the upper mediastinum. Nine (29.0\%) of 31 patients
   with transmural tumours had positive nodes in the upper mediastinum (P =
   0.04). Ten (20.4\%) of 49 patients had many positive nodes in the upper
   mediastinum. Of these 10 patients, 6 patients had 5 or more positive
   nodes in all. The 5-year survival rate for patients with 5 or more
   positive nodes was 7.7\%, which was significantly poorer than patients

   collected from rams during the four seasons of the year to determine
   serum triiodothyronine (T-3) and testosterone hormones. Results showed
   that Barki and Awassi (I and LB) rams are continuous breeders as they
   show sexual desire and produce semen all the year round. However monthly
   variations in semen qualify were defected. Relative testes volume,
   ejaculate volume, sperm concentration, total sperm output, sperm
   motility, percentage of live sperm and serum testosterone level were
   higher during summer months than at other months of the year. Serum T-3
   was significantly higher in winter and spring than that observed in
   summer and autumn. In addition, percentages of dead spermatozoa were
   higher in winter and early spring than in autumn and summer.
   Furthermore, summer months showed moderate percentages of abnormal
   spermatozoa and spermatozoa without intact acrosomes. These results
   indicate that ram semen quality in the subtropics may be better during
   summer months than during of her months of the year.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of ground-based imaging spectroscopy of the {[}Ne
   II] 12.8 mu m line emitted from the ultracompact (UC) H II regions W51d,
   G45.12 +/- 0.13, G35.20 - 1.74, and Monoceros R2, with 2{''} spatial
   resolution. We found that the overall distribution of the {[}Ne II]
   emission is generally in good agreement with the radio (5 or 15 GHz) VLA
   distribution for each source. The Ne+ abundance ({[}Ne+/ H+])
   distributions are also derived from the {[}Ne II] and the radio maps. As
   for G45.12 + 0.13 and W51d, the Ne+ abundance decreases steeply from the
   outer part of the map toward the radio peak. On the other hand, the Ne+
   abundance distributions of G35.20-1.74 and Mon R2 appear rather uniform.
   These results can be interpreted by the variation of ionizing structures
   of neon, which is determined primarily by the spectral type of the
   ionizing stars. We have evaluated the effective temperature of the
   ionizing star by comparing the Ne+ abundance averaged over the whole
   observed region with that calculated by H II region models based on
   recent non-LTE stellar atmosphere models: 39,100(-500)(+1100) K (O7.5
   V-O8 V) for W51d; 37,200(-700)(+1000) K (O8 V-O8.5 V) for G45.12 + 0.13;
   35,00-37,600(-600)(+1500) K (O8 V-O9 V) for G35.20-1.74; and less than
   or equal to 34,000 K (less than or equal to B0 V) for Mon R2. These
   effective temperatures are consistent with those inferred from the

Abstract = {{This study describes the basic design/evaluation of a combined cycle
   power generation system using solid oxide fuel cells in conjunction with

   analyzed from the standpoint of plant size, cell performance, working
   pressure/temperature, steam carbon ratio, fuel/air utilization ratios
   (U-f/U-a) and turbine inlet temperature (TIT). A calculation method for
   determining the system life cycle cost and input energy requirements is
   also proposed. Results show that Eth is higher than that for
   conventional power plants; it has a working temperature/pressure of 1073
   K/0.4 MPa, E-th = 68.3\% with CPT = 9.3 years and EPT = 0.71 years with
   load following capability from 60 to 121\% nominal load. The main

Abstract = {{This work investigates the quantum transport in a narrow constriction
   acted upon by a finite-range transversely polarized time-dependent
   field. A generalized scattering-matrix method is developed that has
   incorporated a time-dependent mode-matching scheme. The transverse field
   induces coherent inelastic scatterings that include both intersubband
   and intersideband transitions. These scatterings give rise to the DC
   conductance G a general suppressed feature that escalates with the
   chemical potential. In addition, particular suppressed features - the
   dip structures - are found in G. These features are recognized as the
   quasibound state (QBS) features that arise from electrons making
   intersubband transitions to the vicinity of a subband bottom. For the
   case of larger held intensities, the QBS features that involve more
   photons are more evident. These QBS features are closely associated with
   the singular density of states at the subband threshold. An experimental
   setup is proposed for the observation of these features. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Limestone dissolution in tropical and subtropical humid southern China
   created residual hills with steep slopes, a landform that is referred to
   as tower karst. Two types of tower karst landform feature, fenglin or
   peak forest (isolated towers) and fengcong or peak cluster (linked-base
   towers), were identified in Guilin. Previous studies proposed two
   hypotheses regarding their origin and evolution. One is the sequential
   evolution model from peak cluster to peak forest. The other is a
   parallel development model, which postulates that both peak cluster and
   peak forest have developed simultaneously.
   Through detailed field survey and analysis of slope forms on tower karst
   in Guilin, it was found that the mean slope angle of the towers is very
   high (62.4 degrees) and ranges from 60 degrees to 75 degrees. There is
   no significant difference in mean slope angle and slope angle
   distribution between towers in the peak cluster basin and peak forest
   floodplain areas. Mean slope angle increases with intensified fluvial
   dissection. Three levels of caves in the towers of the peak forest in
   Guilin were identified in previous research. The isolated towers of the
   peak forest as well as scattered residuals of peak cluster are generally
   distributed in the centre of the Guilin syncline. Favourable
   circumstances of allogenic water concentration indicate that development
   of the peak forest resulted from the combined effects of subcutaneous
   and subterranean dissolution as well as subsequent collapse and
   recession by fluvial erosion after uplifting. By contrast, peak clusters
   generally occur on the limbs of the syncline or at the periphery of the
   Guilin basin with relatively higher elevations. The thick vadose zone
   and predominantly vertical flow suggests that peak clusters are mainly
   formed by the combination of intensive uplifting and the enhancement of
   original dolines. The evidence of slope survey and slope analysis
   suggests that both isolated towers and linked-base towers developed
   simultaneously but by different mechanisms of formation and different
   combinations of development processes. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose To examine the intra- and postoperative factors leading to
   posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) decentration in patients
   requiring IOL exchange, and to identify avoidable causes of IOL
   decentration.
   Methods Case records of 17 patients who had undergone posterior chamber
   IOL exchange were examined for: (i) any complication or alteration to
   the original intended surgical procedure, (ii) IOL type and position at
   the completion of initial surgery, (iii) IOL position at the time of
   re-operation.
   Results The decentred lens implants were injected silicone plate-haptic
   IOLs in 10 patients, small (5.5 mm) optic diameter PMMA IOLs in 4
   patients and large (7 mm) optic diameter PMMA IOLs in 3 patients. In all
   cases, decentration was due to IOL subluxation. Early decentration of
   the injected lenses was due to IOL implantation in eyes without a
   continuous capsulorrhexis. In contrast late decentration was due to
   subluxation associated with capsule fibrosis. Decentration of small
   optic FMMA IOLs was found to be associated with an anterior capsule tear
   and haptic malposition in the ciliary sulcus. Decentration of large
   optic PMMA IOLs was associated with posterior displacement of one haptic
   through a posterior capsule defect, zonule dehiscence or fixation of one
   haptic in the sulcus and one in the capsule bag.
   Conclusion Clinically significant postoperative subluxation of injected
   silicone IOLs may be minimised by implanting only into a lens capsule
   bag with an intact capsulorrhexis. The risk of decentration of small
   optic PMMA IOLs may be minimised by positioning the haptics at 90
   degrees to any capsulorrhexis tear. After cataract surgery complicated
   by posterior capsule rupture or zonule dehiscence, it is important to
   assess the remaining capsule support and, where sufficient, implant a
   large optic diameter posterior chamber IOL in the ciliary sulcus.}},

   unconventional diffusive regime of charge transport is found in the
   range of conductor lengths where the electrons are commonly considered
   as localized. In quantum wires with more than one conducting channel,

Abstract = {{Since the 1960s the nutrient load of Lake Balaton has increased
   significantly, causing a clear decline in water quality. To retain the
   nutrients from the lake, the Kis (small)-Balaton Water Protection System
   (KBWPS) was designed on the lower part of the main inflow, the River
   Zala. The first part of the KBWPS started to function in July 1985.
   After a few years the system became hypertrophic. According to our
   results, approximately 80 000 t of suspended solids, 300 t of total
   phosphorus (TP), 250 t of phosphate-P, 850 t of total nitrogen (TN), and
   2450 t of nitrate-N were retained between 1986 and 1997 by the first
   part of the system. At present, the KBWPS retains about half of the
   suspended solids, more than one-third of TP, more than two-thirds of
   phosphate-P, only one-tenth of TN, but more than half of nitrate. A 16
   km(2) area of the second part has been operating experimentally since
   1992. This part retains approximately 75\% of suspended solids (mostly
   of phytoplankton origin) coming from the first phase, but the phosphorus
   retention is low due to release of phosphorus from sediments. Until 1991
   there were no significant differences in monthly means of the
   chlorophyll-a content from the western part of Lake Balaton. Since that
   time the chlorophyll-a content has been decreasing in the lake. This
   decrease could have been the result of the combined effects of weather
   conditions (temperature, rainfall) and nutrient availability. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Herpes tester infections are frequently observed after allogeneic bone
   marrow transplantation (alloBMT), In the majority of cases, the
   infection is restricted to specific dermatomes and responds to oral
   acyclovir, without visceral dissemination. We report the case of a
   40-year-old male who developed dermatomal herpetic infection 8 months
   post alloBMT, The herpetic rash responded well to treatment with
   high-dose oral acyclovir, However, within a week of cessation of
   therapy, the patient re-presented with dermatomal tester and
   meningoencephalitis. Although the cutaneous lesions resolved with
   intravenous acyclovir, clinical features of meningoencephalitis
   persisted, along with evidence of varicella tester virus (VZV) DNA in
   cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), A satisfactory response to treatment was
   observed only after the addition of intravenous foscarnet to acyclovir,
   Based on our experience with this patient, we suggest that in a subset
   of alloBMT recipients, late dermatomal herpes tester infections may
   respond only partially to treatment with standard oral acyclovir, The
   use of oral acyclovir preparations with higher bioavailability
   (valacyclovir) or intravenous acyclovir early on may prevent the
   considerable morbidity associated with disseminated tester infection.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives-To assess safety and determine effects of IV administration
   of formaldehyde on hemostatic variables in healthy horses.
   Animals-7 healthy adult horses.
   Procedure-Clinical signs and results of CBC, serum biochemical analyses,
   and coagulation testing including template bleeding time (TBT) and
   activated clotting lime (ACT) were compared in horses given a dose of
   0.37\% formaldehyde or lactated Ringer's solution (LRS), IV, in a 2-way
   crossover design. In a subsequent experiment, horses received an
   infusion of 0.74\% formaldehyde or LRS. In another experiment, horses
   were treated with aspirin to impair platelet responses prior to infusion
   of formaldehyde or LRS.
   Results-Significant differences were not detected in any variable
   measured between horses when given formaldehyde or any other treatment.
   Infusion of higher doses of formaldehyde resulted in adverse effects
   including muscle fasciculations, tachycardia, tachypnea, serous ocular
   and nasal discharge, agitation, and restlessness.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Intravenous Infusion of formaldehyde
   at doses that do not induce adverse reactions did not have a detectable
   effect on measured hemostatic variables in healthy horses.}},

Abstract = {{The culture and testing of algae frequently requires stabilization of pH
   levels to maintain the availability of trace metals. In this work we
   evaluated the influence of 25 x 10(-3) M
   N-{[}2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N'-{[}2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid]
   (HEPPSO) and piperazine-N,N'-bis{[}2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid]
   (POPSO) pH buffers, at pH 8.0, on the biological response of Amphidinium
   carterae Hulburt. Growth rate, copper uptake, mean cell size, mean cell
   complexity. and fluorescein labeling: of algae cultures were studied in
   enriched solutions of artificial seawater (ESAWs) containing a range of
   total copper(II) concentrations between 23 x 10(-9) M (level before
   copper addition) and 15 x 10(-6) M. The ESAW (without a pH buffer,
   initial pH = 8.0) was used as the control medium. Initial free copper
   (Cu-free) was between 53 x 10(-15) and 72 x 10(-10) M, which represents
   ranges of concentrations typical of unimpacted and polluted surface
   seawater. These ranges were achieved using ehtylenediaminetetraacetic
   acid (EDTA) alone and in combination with the two buffers. Biological
   data endpoints were interpreted based on the cellular copper
   (Cu-cellular, in fmol/cell) and on the estimated initial inorganic
   copper (Cu-inorg = Cu-free plus that bound with inorganic ligands) in
   the medium. At innocuous Cu-morg, up to 10 x 10(-9) M (Cu-free less than
   or equal to 4 x 10(-11) M), the Cu-cellular was independent of the
   presence of the buffer and very little dependent of Cu-inorg. For
   Cu-inorg up to 0.40 x 10(-9) M, the Cu-cellular was approximately
   constant (0.1-0.2 fmol/cell) and when Cu-inorg ranged between 1.1 x
   10(-9) M and 10 x 10(-9) M the Cu-cellular was three rimes higher but
   also constant. The POPSO enhanced copper uptake and toxicity. The HEPPSO
   reduced uptake and toxicity of copper because of its enhanced binding
   capacity compared to POPSO. Both HEPPSO and POPSO altered copper effects
   on mean cell size, mean cell complexity and fluorescein labeling of A.
   carterae, but the inherent mechanisms differed between the two buffers.
   This present work demonstrated that the chemical binding affinity of
   HEPPSO and POPSO differed and that it resulted in altered uptake and
   effects of copper on algae. These observations have important
   implications in culture and testing of algae that require metals as
   micronutrients yet are sensitive to metals at concentrations that exceed
   basic metabolic needs.}},

   horizontal electric field to the horizontal magnetic field perpendicular
   to the plane of incidence, has been used in geophysics since the early
   1950s for subsurface earth mapping. Traditionally, the electric field
   component has been measured using a staked voltage probe. In 1989, Wu
   and Thiel suggested that an insulated wire dipole without the stakes was
   a more reliable measurement technique. Wait responded to this paper and
   the discussion continued until Wait's last comments were published in
   1999. In this paper, the final arguments are summarized. The major
   conclusion reached is that either technique can be used provided caution
   is exercised, particularly at higher frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{The neural substrates of learning and memory are thought to involve
   use-dependent long-term changes in synaptic function, including
   long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic strength. One biochemical event
   hypothesized to contribute to the maintenance and expression of LTD is
   decreased protein phosphorylation, caused by a decrease in protein
   kinase activity and/or an increase in protein phosphatase activity. We
   tested whether the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) decreases after
   the induction of LTD in area CA1 of the adult hippocampus in vivo, and
   then investigated the mechanism responsible for the LTD-associated
   alteration in PKC activity. We found that LTD was associated with a
   significant decrease in both autonomous and cofactor-dependent PKC
   activity. The decrease in PKC activity was prevented by NMDA receptor
   blockade and was not accompanied by a decrease in the level of either
   PKC alpha, beta, gamma, or zeta. Western blot analysis with
   phosphospecific antibodies revealed that phosphorylation of Ser-657 on
   the catalytic domain of PKC alpha (Ser-660 on PKC beta II) was decreased
   significantly after the induction of LTD, and that this
   dephosphorylation was prevented by the protein phosphatase inhibitor
   okadaic acid. The decrease in autonomous and cofactor-dependent PKC
   activity likewise was prevented by okadaic acid. These findings suggest
   that LTD in the adult hippocampus in vivo involves a decrease in PKC
   activity that is mediated, at least in part, by dephosphorylation of the
   catalytic domain of PKC by protein phosphatases activated after
   LTD-inducing stimulation. Our findings are consistent with the idea that
   protein dephosphorylation contributes to the expression of LTD.}},

   concentrations corresponding to the recommended and at 10 times field
   dose (1.3 and 13 mg kg(-1) dry wt.). Number of total bacteria and number

   time incubations of `early' colonies, to determine the fast-responding
   subpopulation of the culturable bacteria. The number of protozoa
   corresponding to the two subpopulations was followed. The results
   strongly indicate a predatory association between the protozoa and
   bacteria. This was shown by a tight temporal association, and by a
   stimulation of bacteria following predatory release when protozoa were
   inhibited by fenpropimorph. Thus, fenpropimorph disturbed population
   dynamics ir? concentrations, which can be reached in surface soils after

   as radial excitation of the eta and therefore also the nature of the
   l(1440). Another glueball candidate is the f(0)(1500). The investigation
   of the different 4 pi -decay modes of the scalar states may be crucial
   to clarify if a scalar glueball exists below 2 GeV. In order to do so
   four different 5 pi -final states have been investigated. The data are
   clearly dominated by the scalar isoscalar interaction. At least to
   scalar states are needed, the f(0)(1370) and the f(0)(1500). The first
   state decays dominantly into 4 pi, while the 4 pi -decays of the
   f(0)(1500) represent about half of its total width.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a strategy for profiling diverse mixtures of sulfated
   mucin-derived oligosaccharides, liquid chromatography coupled to
   electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) in the
   negative ion mode has been explored. Two mixtures of sulfated
   oligosaccharide alditols from porcine stomach and large intestine were
   analyzed by straight phase chromatography using an amino-bonded column
   connected to a Q-TOF instrument. Nine sulfated mucin-derived
   oligosaccharide alditols from porcine stomach underwent extensive
   fragmentation allowing determination of their sequence. The
   fragmentation generated primary, secondary, and tertiary fragment ions
   informative for the elucidation of the saccharide sequence and
   localization of the sulfate group. From a single chromatographic
   analysis, the sequences of 28 different sulfated mucin oligosaccharide
   alditols purified from porcine large intestine were elucidated,
   revealing information concerning prominent core sequences and terminal
   blood group-type epitopes. Analysis of these two sulfated
   oligosaccharide mi;mixtures demonstrated the usefialness of
   HPLC-ESI-MS/MS: the on-line separation of multiple isomeric sulfated
   oligosaccharides as present in biological samples, informative
   fragmentation allowing the identification of the sequence of
   nonderivatized oligosaccharides, and a sensitivity sufficient for the
   analysis of quantities as obtained from natural sources.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of the regularization of the fluctuations induced
   renormalization of the one-electron density of states (DOS) has been
   recently clarified. So far, only the weak-field limit was considered
   because of the field dependence of the cutoff in the DOS expression.
   Recently, theoretical results {[}A. I Buzdin and A. A. Varlamov, Phys.
   Rev. B 58, 14 195 (1998)] have proposed a scheme of regularization of
   the problem allowing numerical calculations for an arbitrary magnetic
   field. By comparing magnetoconductivity measurements under a strong
   magnetic field and the theoretical predictions, the robustness of the
   expression for the DOS contribution obtained as a convergent series
   independent of cutoff is shown. Such an analysis allows us to calculate
   the zero-field contribution of the fluctuations to the measured
   resistivity. The great influence of this effect on both the magnitude
   and the temperature dependence of the resistivity above T-c is
   demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{In sexual harassment research, the importance of organizational
   variables has become increasingly clear. Utilizing the results of a
   survey conducted at a telecommunications company in 1997 (N = 458), this
   study elaborates on the impact of organizational culture on the
   incidence of unwanted sexual behavior in the workplace. Drawing on
   organizational and gender theory, we proposed that three organizational
   variables would be related to the levels of reported experiences of
   unwanted sexual behavior. First, the social climate in the organization
   is important: respondents who are positive about the social climate in
   their workplace have reported experiencing fewer unwanted sexual
   behaviors than respondents who perceive their organizations as less
   socially oriented. Second, a relationship was found between
   gender-specific aspects of the organizational climate and the extent of
   unwanted sexual behavior: respondents who think that their department
   has a positive attitude toward the equal treatment of women and men at
   work have themselves reported less frequently experiencing unwanted
   sexual behavior. Furthermore, it appears that the respondents who judge
   the attitude of management toward the combination of work and family to
   be positive have reported experiencing fewer incidences of unwanted
   sexual behavior within the department. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{A humanized inhibitory anti-factor IX(a) antibody (SB 249417) has been
   compared to enoxaparin (Lovenox) in a rat model of arterial thrombosis.
   Pretreatment of rats with either SE 249417 (3.0 mg/ kg, i.v.) or
   enoxaparin (30.0 mg/kg, i.v. or s.c.) re suited in comparable and
   significant reductions in thrombus formation. However, the efficacious
   dose of enoxaparin resulted in >30-fold increase in the aPTT over
   baseline, while the efficacious dose of SE 249417 prolonged the aPTT by
   only approximately 3-fold. Additionally, pretreatment with SE 249417
   resulted in sustained blood flow and arterial patency throughout the
   experiment in >80\% of rats treated, In contrast, <30\% of rats
   pretreated with enoxaparin remained patent throughout the experiment.
   The data in this report indicate that the selective inhibition of factor

Abstract = {{Post-translational modification of enamel proteins is regulated by
   casein kinases (CK) and results in binding sites for calcium ions that
   subsequently pray a key role during the initial stages of
   mineralization. Phosphorylation may also influence the secretion and
   extracellular organization of enamel proteins. Previous studies
   indicated that inositol hexasulphate inhibited the activity of CK-I
   and/or CK-II in mouse tooth germs (Torres-Quintana et al., 1998). We
   hypothesized that inositol hexasulphate would also inhibit the activity
   of the specific casein kinase(s) identified in secretory ameloblasts,
   and would prove useful for determination of the extent to which
   phosphorylation might influence the organization of enamel proteins at
   early stages of enamel formation. To test this hypothesis, we dissected
   mandibular first molars from 18-day-old mouse embryos and cultured them
   for 11 days in the presence of 0-0.1 mM inositol hexasulphate.
   Ultrastructural analysis revealed that the formation of enamel was
   largely impaired at an inhibitor concentration greater than or equal to
   0.08 mM. Quantitative radioautographic analysis of {[}P-33]phosphate
   incorporation indicated that radiolabeled phosphate normally secreted
   into forming enamel was retained within ameloblasts. In contrast, no
   significant difference was observed between control and
   inositol-hexasulphate-treated tooth germs when cultures were labeled
   with {[}H-3]serine and {[}H-3]proline. SDS-PAGE and Western blot
   analysis confirmed that while inositol hexasulphate inhibited
   CK-mediated phosphorylation, it did not significantly alter protein
   synthesis. We conclude that impairment of phosphorylation leads to
   intracellular accumulation of {[}H-3]phosphate-containing material by
   ameloblasts. We also conclude that when non-phosphorylated enamel matrix
   proteins are secreted they are either unable to farm an enamel matrix
   that supports mineralization, or they diffuse throughout a poorly
   mineralized dentin.}},

   groups lie at the same side of the boron sp(2) plane. This compound
   crystallizes as conglomerates to give single crystals consisting of one
   or the other enantiomeric forms, both of which are CD active in the
   solid state. In solutions, molecules exist as a mixture of two
   conformational isomers, the C-3 and C-1 symmetric forms. Interconversion
   between the two isomers was observed by the variable temperature F-19
   NMR, the barriers to isomerization being 8 and 6 kcal mol(-1) for two
   independent processes in the two ring flip mechanism. The presence of
   C-F . . .B interactions was supported by the short F . . .B contacts

Abstract = {{Disturbance in ionic gradient across sarcolemma may lead to arrhythmias.
   Because Na+-K+-ATPase regulates intracellular Na+ and K+ concentrations,
   and therefore intracellular Ca2+ concentration homeostasis, our aim was
   to determine whether changes in the Na+-K+-ATPase alpha-isoforms in
   guinea pigs during transition from compensated (CLVH) to decompensated
   left ventricular hypertrophy (DLVH) were concomitant with arrhythmias.
   After 12- and 20-mo aortic stenosis, CLVH and DLVH were characterized by
   increased mean arterial pressure (30\% and 52.7\%, respectively). DLVH
   differed from CLVH by significantly increased end-diastolic pressure
   (34\%), decreased sarco( endo) plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (-75\%),
   and increased Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (25\%) mRNA levels and by the
   occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. The alpha-isoform (mRNA and
   protein levels) was significantly lower in DLVH (2.2 +/- 0.2- and 1.4
   +/- 0.15- fold, respectively, vs. control) than in CLVH (3.5 +/- 0.4-
   and 2.2 +/- 0.13-fold, respectively) and was present in sarcolemma and T
   tubules. Changes in the levels of alpha(1)- and alpha(3)-isoform in CLVH
   and DLVH appear physiologically irrelevant. We suggest that the
   increased level of alpha(2)-isoform in CLVH may participate in
   compensation, whereas its relative decrease in DLVH may enhance
   decompensation and arrhythmias.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the efficacy of ultrasound-guided steroid
   injection for the treatment of proximal plantar fasciitis and to
   evaluate mechanical properties of the heel pad after steroid injection.
   Design: Proximal plantar fascia and heel pad were assessed with a 10-MHz
   linear array ultrasound transducer. Pain intensity was quantified with a
   tenderness threshold (TT) and visual analog scale (VAS). The transducer
   was incorporated into a specially designed device to measure mechanical
   properties of the heel pad. Evaluations were performed before injection
   and at 2 weeks and 3 months after injection.
   Setting: An outpatient clinic of a tertiary care center.
   Patients: Fourteen consecutive patients with unilateral proximal plantar
   fasciitis.
   Intervention: Ultrasound-guided injection of 7 mg betamethasone and 0.5
   mL of 1\% lidocaine into the inflamed proximal plantar fascia.
   Main Outcome Measures: VAS, TT: heel pad and plantar fascia thickness,
   and echogenicity of the proximal plantar fascia on sonogram were
   assessed. Mechanical properties included unloaded heel pad thickness,
   compressibility index, and energy dissipation ratio.
   Results: Both VAS score +/- standard deviation (SD, 5.43 +/- 2.03, 1.39
   +/- 2.19, 0.57 +/- 1.40 at the 3 measurements, respectively) and TT +/-
   SD (5.05 +/- 1.42, 9.34 +/- 1.84, 9.93 +/- 1.98 kg/cm(2) at the 3
   measurements, respectively) improved significantly (p < .001) after
   steroid injection. The mean thickness of the planter fascia was greater
   in the symptomatic side than in the asymptomatic side before treatment
   (0.58 +/- 0.13 cm vs 0.40 +/- 0.11 cm. p < .001). The thickness had
   decreased significantly 3 months after injection (0.46 +/- 0.12 cm at 2
   weeks, 0.42 +/- 0.10 cm at 3 months, p <.001). The hypoechogenicity at
   the proximal planter fascia disappeared after steroid injection (p <
   .001). Mechanical properties of the heel pad did not change 3 months
   after steroid injection (p > .05),
   Conclusion: Ultrasound offers an objective measurement of the
   therapeutic effect on proximal plantar fasciitis.-Accurate steroid
   injection under ultrasound guidance can effectively treat proximal
   plantar fasciitis without significant deterioration of the mechanical
   properties of the heel pads.}},

Abstract = {{Session length and group size are two most significant factors in
   achieving efficient scheduling for unicast and multicast traffic in
   single-hop wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) local area networks
   (LANs). This paper presents a hybrid protocol to schedule both unicast
   and multicast traffic in broadcast WDM networks. The protocol makes an
   important assumption that unicast traffic is the major portion of the
   overall traffic and is usually scheduled with a pre-allocation-based
   protocol. On the other hand, multicast traffic is a major portion of the
   overall traffic with multicast sessions and multicast groups, and is
   scheduled with a reservation-based protocol. The concept of multicast
   threshold, a function of random variables including the multicast
   session length and the multicast group size, is also proposed to
   partition the multicast traffic into two types. If the transmission
   threshold of a multicast request is larger than the multicast threshold,
   the request is handled with a reservation-based protocol. Otherwise, the
   multicast request is handled similar to unicast traffic; that is, each
   packet in the multicast session is replicated and sent to the unicast
   queues of destinations. The results show that the hybrid protocol can
   achieve better channel utilization efficiency and packet delay for
   unicast traffic under the multicast scenarios with moderate session
   length and group size. However, separate scheduling or broadcasting will
   be more suitable for a multicast scenario with very large session length
   and group size, which is not common on most realistic networks.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate electronic stales in M-channel Anderson lattice model
   using expansion from the limit of large spin-orbital degeneracy N

   higher order terms in power of 1/N. What we find are: in the single
   channel case, we show that the imaginary part of the self-energy of
   conduction electrons is given by a form proportional to omega (2) +
   (piT)(2) which is due to the intersite correlation effects. In the
   multichannel case, we find a T-linear term in the imaginary part of the
   self-energy at the Fermi level, in contrast to a T-2-term in the Fermi
   liquid or a constant term in the non-Fermi liquid found in infinite
   dimensions. The disappearance of the imaginary part at T = 0 is due to
   the intersite correlation effects that reflect the translational
   invariance. The results are compared with those obtained in infinite
   dimensions. The Luttinger sum rule is proved to hold.}},

Abstract = {{To explore the effects linked to the presence of second phases in the
   wear mechanisms and performances of alumina, some low-purity alumina
   ceramics with an alumina content ranging from 79.0 to 95\% were
   investigated. The tribological behaviour of these materials was
   evaluated using a pin-on-disc apparatus, coupling them with a reference
   material, a high-purity alumina, 99.6\% alumina content.
   Extensive SEM observations at normal incidence and on the cross sections
   of the worn surfaces of specimens showed fairly close relationships
   among chemical-mineralogical composition, material transfer and friction
   and wear responses. Particularly interesting are some behaviours
   directly related to the presence of the transferred layers: (i) adhesion
   and sticking phenomena, due to the softened low-melting layers at the
   interfaces and (ii) an increasing wear rate of the high-purity alumina
   pins as the alumina content of the coupled discs decreases. (C) 2000

   technology levels) to the perceived impacts of the introduction of
   Notes. The major findings indicated that the adoption of Notes is
   strongly associated with the existing technology level of organizations.
   However, contrary to common belief, organizations with medium-technology
   levels are making significantly more use of Notes than organizations
   with high-technology levels. The study also indicated that organizations
   with a mechanistic culture use more of Notes for monitoring purposes
   while organizations with organic culture use it more for dissemination
   of information and for communication. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Bone mineral density (BMD) and mechanical strength generally show strong
   positive correlations. However, osteopetrosis is a metabolic bone
   disease with increased skeletal density radiographically and increased
   risk of fracture. We have evaluated mechanical strength and mineral
   density in three osteopetrotic mutations in the rat (incisors-absent
   {[}ia/ia], osteopetrosis {[}op/op], and toothless {[}tl/tl]) to test the
   hypothesis that reduced bone resorption in one or more of these
   mutations results in weaker bones in the presence of greater mineral
   density and skeletal mass. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography
   (pQCT) was used to analyze BMD and cross-sectional geometry in the
   tibial diaphysis and metaphysis as well as the femoral diaphysis and
   femoral neck, The bending breaking force of tibial and femoral midshafts
   was obtained using the three-point bending test and femoral neck
   strength was tested by axial loading. Osteopetrotic mutants were
   significantly smaller than their normal littermates (NLMs) in each
   stock. The pQCT analysis showed that BMD and bone mineral content (BMC)
   were higher than or equal to NLMs in all skeletal sites measured in the
   osteopetrotic mutants. However, the mechanical breaking force was equal
   to or lower than their NLMs in all sites. The cross-sectional structure
   of long bone shafts was markedly different in osteopetrotic mutants,
   having a thin cortex and a medullary area filled with primary trabecular
   bone, These results indicate that osteopetrotic mutations in the rat
   increase bone density and decrease bone strength. The tibial diaphysis
   was significantly weaker in tl/tl and ia/ia mutants and the tibial
   metaphysis showed the greatest increase in BMD in all mutants. These
   data are another illustration that an increased BMD does not necessarily
   lead to stronger bones.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We evaluated the ability of a newly developed continence index
   to predict the return of urinary continence 3 months after radical
   retropubic prostatectomy.
   Materials and Methods: We developed and used a continence index to
   determine continence level after removal of the urinary catheter on
   postoperative day 15 in 145 men. A total of 20 patients were evaluated
   independently by 2 nurse specialists to assess continence index
   reliability. We evaluated continence level, pad use and degree of
   bothersomeness due to incontinence 3 months after catheter removal. The
   association of continence score with outcome variables was calculated
   using the Mantel-Haenszel trend test and the predictive ability of the
   continence score was determined by logistic regression to produce
   cumulative odds ratios.
   Results: The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.995 for the
   independently assessed continence index ratings and the Cronbach
   coefficient cr was 0.65 for the 5 continence index parameters. Complete
   continence or continence with heavy activity but not always was achieved
   by 96\%, 85\% and 68\% of the men in tertiles 1 (continence score 18), 2
   (continence score 15 to 17) and 3 (continence score 14 or less),
   respectively. The cumulative odds ratio of 2.9 (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI] 1.9 to 4.6) per tertile indicated. a 2.9-fold increased chance of
   incontinence for each successively lower tertile. In addition, 96\%,
   82\% and 68\% of the men in tertiles 1 to 3, respectively, required no
   or 1 small pad daily. The cumulative odds ratio for pad use was 2.3
   (95\% CI 1.5 to 3.5) per tertile. Of the patients in tertiles 1 to 3
   100\%, 97\% and 80\%, respectively, had no or slight bothersomeness due
   to urinary incontinence. The cumulative odds ratio for bothersomeness
   level was 2.7 (95\% CI 1.7 to 4.3) per tertile. The Mantel-Haenszel
   trend test showed a significant association of continence score with all
   3 outcome variables (p less than or equal to 0.001).
   Conclusions: Our continence index is a simple and reliable instrument
   that provides useful prognostic information on the early return of
   continence after radical retropubic prostatectomy.}},

Abstract = {{Properties of disordered nematic elastomers and gels are theoretically
   investigated with emphasis on the roles of nonlocal elastic interactions
   and crosslinking conditions. Networks originally crosslinked in the
   isotropic phase lose their long-range orientational order by the action
   of quenched random stresses, which we incorporate into the
   affine-deformation model of nematic rubber elasticity. We present a
   detailed picture of mechanical quasi-Goldstone modes, which accounts for
   an almost completely soft polydomain-monodomain (PM) transition under
   strain as well as a ``four-leaf clover{''} pattern in depolarized light
   scattering intensity. Dynamical relaxation of the domain structure is
   numerically studied using a simple model. The peak wave number of the
   structure factor obeys a power-law-type slow kinetics and goes to zero
   in true mechanical equilibrium. The effect of quenched disorder on
   director fluctuation in the monodomain state is analyzed. The random
   frozen contribution to the fluctuation amplitude dominates the thermal
   one, at long wavelengths and near the PM transition threshold. We also
   study networks obtained by crosslinking polydomain nematic polymer
   melts. The memory of the initial director configuration acts as
   correlated and strong quenched disorder, which renders the PM transition
   nonsoft. The spatial distribution of the elastic free energy is strongly
   dehomogenized by external strain, in contrast to the case of
   isotropically crosslinked networks.}},

Abstract = {{The practical value of elaborated vibrational spectroscopic techniques
   in medical and microbiological biodiagnostics depends strongly on the
   reliability, the speed, the ease of use, and the evaluation procedures
   of the acquired data. Ln the present study, artificial neural networks
   (ANNs) were used to establish a hierarchical classification system for
   microbial Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra suitable for
   identification purposes in a routine microbiological laboratory: A
   radial basis function network (RBF) proved to be superior for a
   top-level classification of the FT-IR spectra at the genus level.
   Species within these genera were sequentially further classified by
   using multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), which achieved a larger
   differentiation depth than RBF networks. The MLPs were trained with
   several learning algorithms. Best performance was achieved with the
   cascade correlation (CC) approach to determine the network topology
   combined with resilient propagation (Rprop) as the training algorithm.
   The final hierarchically organized model was able to discriminate
   between four genera of microorganisms comprising 42 different strains of
   Pseudomonacae, 33 strains of Bacillus, 46 strains of Staphylococcus, and
   6 species and 24 strains of yeast genera Candida. Altogether, 145
   strains from international microbial strain collections are comprised in
   971 spectra. The species Candida albicans could be further classified
   with respect to susceptibility against the antibiotic drug fluconazole,
   which is of therapeutic relevance. Key factors for the classification
   results of the bacterial FT-IR spectra were the data pretreatment, the
   number of wavelengths selected by a feature extraction algorithm, the
   type of network, and the learning function used for the ANN training.}},

Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{174}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{233-238}},

Abstract = {{Carvacrol, a natural antimicrobial compound present in the essential oil
   fraction of oregano and thyme, is bactericidal towards Bacillus cereus.
   A decrease of the sensitivity of B. cereus towards carvacrol was
   observed after growth in the presence of non-lethal carvacrol
   concentrations. A decrease of the melting temperature (T-m) of membranes
   from 20.5 degrees C to 12.6 degrees C was the immediate effect of the
   addition of carvacrol. Cells adapted to 0.4 mM carvacrol showed a lower
   membrane fluidity than nonadapted cells. Adaptation of 0.4 mM carvacrol
   increased the T-m from 20.5 degrees C to 28.3 degrees C. The addition of
   carvacrol to cell suspensions of adapted B. cereus cells decreased T-m
   again to 19.5 degrees C, approximately the same value as for the
   non-adapted cells in the absence of carvacrol. During adaptation,
   changes in the fatty acid composition were observed. The relative amount
   of iso-C-13:0, C-14:0 and iso-C-15:0 increased and cis-C-16:1 and C-18:0
   decreased. The head-group composition also changed, two additional

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of amygdala lesion (AL) or hippacampal lesion
   (HL) on hypergravity-induced motion sickness in rats. Rats do not vomit,
   but the behavior known as pica, the eating of non-nutritive substances
   such as kaolin, can be used as an index of motion sickness. In the
   present study, hypergravity-induced kaolin intake and
   apomorphine-induced kaolin intake were measured before and after brain
   lesions. After AL, hypergravity-induced kaolin intake and the ratio of
   the hypergravity- to apomorphine-induced kaolin intakes were decreased.
   These results indicate that AL suppressed motion sickness more than pica
   behavior itself, suggesting that the amygdala plays an important role in
   the development of motion sickness in rats. Conversely, after HL,
   hypergravity-induced kaolin intake was increased, as was the ratio of
   the hypergravity- to apomorphine-induced kaolin intakes. These results
   indicate that HL aggravates motion sickness induced by hypegravity in
   rats, suggesting that the hippocampus counteracts motion sickness.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of 0.1-100 mu m riluzole, a neuroprotective agent with
   anticonvulsant properties, were studied on neurons from rat brain
   cortex. Patch-clamp whole-cell recordings in voltage-clamp mode were
   performed on thin slices to examine the effects of the drug on a
   noninactivating (persistent) Na+ current (I-Na,I-p). I-Na,I-p was
   selected because it enhances neuronal excitability near firing
   threshold, which makes it a potential target for anticonvulsant drugs.
   When added to the external solution, riluzole dose-dependently inhibited
   I-Na,I-p up to a complete blocking of the current (EC50 2 mu m), showing
   a significant effect at therapeutic drug concentrations. A comparative
   dose-effect study was carried out in the same cells for the other main
   known action of riluzole, the inhibitory effect on the fast transient
   sodium current. This effect was confirmed in our experiments, but we
   found that it was achieved at levels much higher than putative
   therapeutic concentrations. Only the effect on I-Na,I-p, and not that on
   fast sodium current, can account for the reduction in neuronal
   excitability observed in cortical neurons following riluzole treatment
   at therapeutic concentrations, and this might represent a novel
   mechanism accounting for the anticonvulsant and neuroprotective
   properties of riluzole.}},

Abstract = {{Inhibition of N-2 fixation under water deficits has been hypothesized to
   result from N feedback within the plant involving ureides and/or
   asparagine (Asn). This study was undertaken to investigate ureide and
   Asn accumulation in shoots and nodules in response to treatments
   inhibiting nodule activity (acetylene reduction assay, ARA) such as Asn,
   ureide, or polyethylene glycol application to the nutrient solution of
   plants, boric acid on leaves, and imposition of a water deficit, ARA
   inhibition and nodule concentration of Asn and ureide were correlated to
   the ureide treatment applied (3-15 mM applied in the nutrient solution).
   Supplying Asn (3-9 mM applied in the nutrient solution) also induced an
   increase in nodule Asn and ureide concentration, which was associated
   with ARA inhibition. Spraying boric acid on leaves also inhibited ARA in
   parallel to an increase in shoot ureide and module Asn concentration
   while nodule ureide remained unchanged, By contrast, polyethylene glycol
   (PEG) inhibited ARA in parallel to an increase in nodule Asn and ureide
   concentration while shoot ureide was unchanged. The decline in ARA in
   response to water deficit was associated with an increase in nodule
   ureide, Asn and aspartate (Asp), although the increases in Asn and Asp
   were less than for ureides, Altogether, the results of these experiments
   indicated that Asn cannot be the only compound involved in the feedback
   inhibition of ARA, Instead ureide and Asn are probably both involved,
   either directly by accumulation of products that fail to be exported, or
   by feedback from the shoot due to an N-compound supply that exceeds
   shoot requirements.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we report further investigations of the IRAS selected
   sample of Planetary Nebula (PN) candidates that was presented in Van de
   Steene \& Pottasch (1993). About 20\% of the candidates in that sample
   have been detected in the radio and/or H alpha and later confirmed as
   PNe. Here we investigate the infrared properties of the IRAS sources not
   confirmed as PNe.
   We observed 28 objects in the N-band of which 20 were detected and 5
   were resolved, despite adverse weather conditions. We obtained medium
   resolution Br gamma spectra and we took high resolution JHKL images of
   these 20 objects. We critically assessed the identification of the IRAS
   counterpart in the images and compared our identification with others in
   the literature. High spatial resolution and a telescope with very
   accurate pointing are crucial for correct identification of the IRAS
   counterparts in these crowded fields.
   Of sixteen positively identified objects, seven show Br gamma in
   absorption. The absorption lines are very narrow in six objects,
   indicating a low surface gravity. Another six objects show Br gamma in
   emission. Two of these also show photospheric absorption lines. All
   emission line sources have a strong underlying continuum, unlike normal
   PNe. In another three objects, no clear Br gamma absorption or emission
   was visible. The fact that our objects were mostly selected from the
   region in the IRAS color-color diagram where typically PNe are found,
   may explain our higher detection rate of emission line objects compared
   to previous studies, which selected their candidates from a region
   between AGB and PNe.
   The: objects showing Br gamma in emission were re-observed in the radio
   continuum with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. None of them were
   detected above a detection limit of 0.55 mJy/beam at 6 cm and 0.7
   mJy/beam at 3 cm, while they should have been easily detected if the
   radio flux was optically thin and Case B recombination was applicable.
   It is suggested that the Br gamma emission originates in the
   post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) wind, and that the central star
   is not yet hot enough to ionize the AGE shell.
   We measured the JHKL magnitudes of the objects and present their
   infrared spectral energy distributions. They are typical for post-AGE
   stars according to the scheme of van der Veen et al. (1989). We also
   constructed Various color-color diagrams using the near-infrared and
   IRAS magnitudes. No distinction can be made between the, objects showing
   Br gamma in emission, absorption, or a flat spectrum in the near and
   far-infrared color-color diagrams. The near-infrared color-color
   diagrams show evidence for a very large range of extinction, which in
   part is of circumstellar origin. Near-infrared versus far-infrared
   color-color diagrams show trends that are consistent with the expected
   evolution of the circumstellar shell. This sample of post-AGE stars show
   a larger range in color and are generally redder and closer to the
   galactic plane than the ones known so far.
   The properties of most of these objects are fully consistent with the
   assumption that they are post-AGE stars that have not evolved far enough
   yet to ionize a significant fraction of their circumstellar material.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Solids flow patterns were observed and measured in the square
   cross-section riser of a laboratory circulating fluidised bed (CFB).
   Measurements in the 0.14 m square riser used a sampling probe, of
   internal diameter 3.4 mm, to measure upwards and downwards solids fluxes
   throughout the cross-section. Interpolation gave complete solids flux
   profiles over the entire 0.14 x 0.14 m cross-section. Integration of the
   solids flux profile gave the external solids circulation rate, in
   reasonable agreement with measurements external to the riser. Special
   features of the solids flux profiles are (i) much higher down flux in
   the corners of the square section and (ii) slightly higher down flux
   half-way between the corners, near the walls. These features may be due
   to secondary flow in the square, section duct and to enhanced sheltering
   provided by the two side walls. There is qualitative similarity between
   these solids flux profiles in the 0.14 m square riser and the profiles
   measured by Werdermann ((1992, Feststoffbewegung und Warmeubergang in
   zirkulierenden Wirbelschichten von Kohlekraftwerken. Dr-Ingenieur
   dissertation, Technical University Hamburg-Harburg) for large
   industrial. combustors. But it is clear that there is a scale-up effect:
   the film, i.e. the cross-sectional area of duct containing the downflow
   (adjacent to the walls), is a much smaller proportion of the total area
   in the large units as compared with the laboratory units. The detail
   design of the riser exit or outlet bend at the top of the riser has a
   profound effect upon solids flux profiles in the riser and in particular
   on the reflux ratio defined as k(m) = (solids downward flow)/(external
   circulation rate). Measured values of k(m) varied by a factor of about
   20 according to outlet bend design. These measurements were mostly near
   the top of the riser, but indications are that k(m) is affected,
   throughout the riser, by the design of outlet bend, a phenomenon
   previously observed in a CFB of circular cross-section by Brereton and
   Grace ((1994). In A. A. Avidan, Circulating Fluidized Bed Technology IV

Abstract = {{As part of the pre-clinical testing process of a newly developed
   temporomandibular joint (TMJ) prosthesis, animal experiments were
   performed. In 14 sheep, the right TMJ was replaced by the developed TMJ
   prosthesis. The prosthesis consisted of a skull part, a mandibular part
   and an intervening polyethylene disc. In the first series (6 sheep),
   three designs were tested, differing in the applied metal (stainless
   steel or titanium) and in the fitting method of the skull part (a
   fitting member or bone cement). The sheep were sacrificed after 8-16
   weeks. In the second series (8 sheep), the preferred titanium fitting
   member design was applied, and the sheep were sacrificed after 2-10
   weeks. One sheep was excluded because no correct position of the
   prosthesis parts could be achieved. At sacrifice, the removal torque of
   the screws was measured, and the surrounding tissues were harvested for
   histologic examination. The sheep recovered well and functioned until
   the end of the scheduled sacrifice date. Encountered problems were two
   disc dislocations, one fistula formation, and one screw failure. All
   mandibular parts were clinically stable, as were most skull parts with a
   fitting member, and one of both skull parts fitted with bone cement. The
   clinically observed stability was confirmed by the removal torque
   values, which indicated well-integrated screws. It is concluded that the
   TMJ prosthesis could remain stable and functional over the initial
   healing period. The main restriction of the sheep model is the much
   larger translatory capacity compared with patients, which adversely
   influences tissue healing.}},

Abstract = {{The relation between CaM kinase II activity and high Ca2+-mediated
   stress responses was studied in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells.
   Treatment with ionomycin (1 muM) for 5 min caused a significant loss of
   CaM kinase II activity in whole cell homegenates and prominent
   vesiculation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Similar losses of CaM
   kinase II activity were observed in the soluble lysate as assessed by
   activity measurements and Western blotting. Examination of the
   post-lysate particulate fraction showed that the loss of CaM kinase II
   from the soluble lysate was accompanied by a redistribution of CaM
   kinase II to this fraction. The ionomycin-mediated response was limited
   to this concentration (1 muM); lower concentrations of ionomycin as well
   as stimulation with angiotensin II (1 muM) or ATP (100 muM) did not
   cause a shift in CaM kinase II distribution. Treatment with neither the
   CaM kinase II inhibitor KN-93 nor the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid
   altered the ionomycin-induced redistribution indicating that CaM kinase
   II activation and/or phosphorylation was not part of the mechanism. The
   response, however, was eliminated when the cells were treated in
   Ca2+-free medium. Washout of ionomycin led to only a partial restoration
   of the kinase activity in the soluble fraction after 10 min.
   Immunofluorescence microscopy of resting cells indicated colocalization
   of antibodies to CaM kinase II and an ER protein marker. ER vesiculation
   induced by ionomycin coincided with a parallel redistribution of CaM
   kinase II and ER marker proteins. These data link ionomycin-induced ER
   restructuring to a progressive redistribution of CaM kinase II protein
   to an insoluble particulate fraction and loss of cellular CaM kinase II
   activity. We propose that redistribution of CaM kinase II and loss of
   cellular activity are components of a common Ca2+-overload induced
   cellular stress response in cells.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the effect of the calcium blocker amlodipine on the

   acutely administered to sine-aortic baroreceptor-denervated (SAD) rats

   sham-denervated rats (0, 50, 150, 500, and 1500 mg kg(-1) feed, 4 days
   per dose). Acute amlodipine administration caused significant
   dose-dependent reductions of the mean MAP level and short-term MAP
   variability at the 3 and 10 mg/kg dose levels, respectively. Chronic
   administration produced dose-dependent reductions in short-term MAP
   variability, becoming significant at the 150 and 500 mg kg(-1) feed dose
   level in SAD and Sham groups, respectively. Day-night differences in
   blood pressure were significantly attenuated or reversed at the 500 and
   1500 mg kg(-1) feed dose levels. Amlodipine had little or no effect upon
   the 24 h MAP level, long-term MAP variability, and only modestly reduced
   the MAP response to hexamethonium. These results demonstrate that
   amlodipine can reduce MAP variability independent of changes in the mean
   blood pressure level.}},

Abstract = {{Access to data about the clinical problems. patients, and processes that
   characterise family practice is essential for the development of this
   specialty. Practice-based research networks (PBRNs) play an increasing
   role in obtaining these data.
   We compared 3 PBRNs: one in Wisconsin in the United States, one in
   Wessex in the United Kingdom, and one in Nijmegen in the Netherlands. We
   organized our data into 4 key areas for review: the mission of the
   network, its contribution to the evidence base of family medicine, the
   management of the network, and the financing of the network
   infrastructure.
   Extending the evidence base of family practice is the overriding
   objective of these networks, and their main focus is on common
   morbidities. They provide access to unselected patient populations, but
   there are differences in their size.
   There are aspects of PBRNs that are common in countries with different
   health care systems, despite the fact that local circumstances-the
   research mission or the characteristics of the health care system under
   which they operate-determine their form and structure. Networks develop
   over time and their focus and activities may evolve. Financial support
   for these networks continues to be a problem.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate histomorphometric age-related changes in labial
   salivary glands (LSG) of healthy subjects, with special reference to the
   mucous and seromucous acini.
   Method: Investigation of age-related histomorphometric changes was
   conducted on 120 samples of LSG obtained from autopsy subjects free of
   salivary gland tumors/diseases. Samples were divided into young (<0
   years, n = 30), adult (30-60 years, n = 45) and old (> 60 years, n = 45)
   age groups. Measurements were performed an hematoxylin and eosin stained
   slides. Parenchymal components included acini and ducts. The acinar
   component was presently analyzed separately in respect to mucous acinar
   cells and seromucous acinar cells. Mucous acinar cells presented pale
   eosinophilic cytoplasm, while that of the seromucous was darker and
   basophilic. Stromal components included connective tissue, blood and
   lymphatic vessels, inflammatory infiltrate and adipose tissue. The mean
   volume fraction (V-v) of all components in each age group was
   calculated. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA and
   Tamhane tests.
   Results: The mean V-v of the seromucous acinar cells decreased by 49.3\%
   (p < 0.0001) and that of the mucous acinar cells decreased only by
   28.5\% (p = 0.0001). Changes in the ducts were statistically
   non-significant (p = 0.312). Of the stromal components: the mean V-v of
   the adipose tissue showed the highest increase, 2768\% (p < 0.0001)
   followed by the inflammatory infiltrate, 512\% (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: The marked decrease in the V-v of seromucous acinar cells
   accompanied by a lower decrease in the V-v of mucous acinar cells may
   explain age-related changes in LSG secretion. These findings could bear
   important implications regarding functional age-related changes of these

Abstract = {{The electron-phonon coupling for the E-2 --> (4)A(2) transition on Cr3+
   has been determined for different chromium doped garners by measuring
   the ratio between vibronic and zero-phonon line intensity, and by
   performing temperature dependent line broadening and line shift
   measurements. It was found that the electron-phonon coupling for the
   transition is dependent on the covalency of the host lattice: due to the
   difference in covalency the electron-phonon coupling for a gallate
   lattice (e.g. Y3Ca5O12) is higher than the aluminate lattice (e.g.
   Y3Al5O12).
   Measurements on the dependence of electron-phonon coupling on the size
   of the site for which Cr3+ substitutes indicate that the value of the
   electron-phonon coupling parameter alpha (determined from temperature
   dependent line shift measurements) is lower for garnets where Cr3+
   resides in the smaller Ga3+- and Al3+-sites (e.g. Y3Al5O12 and Y3Ga5O12)
   than for the garnets with Cr3+ on a bigger Sc3+-site (e.g. Y3Sc2Al3O12
   and Gd3Sc2Al3O12. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The rDNA is the genetic locus that encodes the ribosomal RNAs and
   physically defines where ribosomes start to assemble. In the yeast
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae, its highly repetitive structure makes it a
   very interesting target for studies about genome stability, chromatin
   mediated transcriptional silencing and progression of aging. In fact,
   recombination among the repeated units is suppressed in a WT cell.
   Moreover, when genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II are inserted in
   the rDNA cluster, their transcription is silenced. Finally, the
   formation of rDNA minicircles has been shown to be one of the causes of
   aging in yeast. DNA topoisomerase I has been shown to suppress
   recombination specifically at the rDNA of S. cerevisiae. Moreover, also
   the chromatin structure of this locus is affected in a top1 strain,
   because rDNA specific transcriptional silencing is abolished.
   Nonetheless, the molecular basis of how this enzyme interferes with
   these functions is yet unknown. Here are reported results obtained by in
   vivo studies of DNA-protein interactions occurring on the rDNA locus.
   The analyses include mapping of: nucleosome positioning; RNA polymerase
   I transcription factors and DNA topoisomerase I cleavage sites.
   Important conclusions can be drawn: nucleosome positioning in the
   Non-transcribed Spacer (NTS) is not affected by RNA polymerase I
   transcription; the RNA polymerase I transcription factors bind DNA in
   vivo with a defined hierarchy, the DNA topoisomerase I cleaves the NTS
   in very specific sites, but cleavage is not induced by RNA polymerase I
   transcription. These in vivo studies help to characterize, the molecular
   basis of important phenomena as the transcriptional silencing and genome
   stability in yeast.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Chemotherapy using multi-drug regimens is considered more
   active than single-agent therapy. This may be due to synergistic
   interactions or, simply, a higher probability of administering an active
   agent. We investigated in vitro the type of drug interactions in a
   recognized regimen in relationship to tumour type and drug sensitivity.
   Patients and methods: The possibility of synergistic and additive
   interactions between individual cytotoxic drugs was investigated for the
   component drugs of the established FEC regimen, i.e., 5-fluorouracil,
   epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, in 243 patient tumour samples
   representing various drug sensitivity using the non-clonogenic
   fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay.
   Results: Using a cell survival of less than or equal to 50\% as a limit
   for drug activity and sample sensitivity, the overall response rates to
   the most active single drug (D-max) and the combination were 56\% and
   64\%, respectively, with a distribution among diagnoses similar to that
   in the clinic. For 86\% of the samples there was concordance with
   respect to judgement of activity using either D-max or the combination.
   For samples being sensitive to at least one single drug, 95\% were also
   sensitive to the combination whereas for samples with insignificant
   D-max effect, only 2\% were sensitive to the combination. In samples
   with modest D-max effects, i.e., cell survival in the range > 50\%-less
   than or equal to 80\%, 45\% responded to the combination. The effect of
   the combination was generally well predicted from the D-max effect.
   Conclusions: The superior antitumour effect of drug combinations
   compared with single drugs may be due to the higher chance of selecting
   an active agent. However, for intermediately sensitive tumours,
   additional interaction effects of a combination may be of clinical
   significance.}},

Abstract = {{The ``spectral nudging{''} method imposes time-variable large-scale
   atmospheric states on a regional atmospheric model. It is based on the
   idea that regional-scale climate statistics are conditioned by the
   interplay between continental-scale atmospheric conditions and such
   regional features as marginal seas and mountain ranges. Following this
   ``downscaling{''} idea, the regional model is forced to satisfy not only
   boundary conditions, possibly in a boundary sponge region, but also
   large-scale flow conditions inside the integration area.
   In the present paper the performance of spectral nudging in an extended
   climate simulation is examined. Its success in keeping the simulated
   state close to the driving state at larger scales, while generating
   smaller-scale features is demonstrated, and it is also shown that the
   standard boundary forcing technique in current use allows the regional
   model to develop internal states conflicting with the large-scale state.
   It is concluded that spectral nudging may be seen as a suboptimal and
   indirect data assimilation technique.}},

Abstract = {{The large number of polymorphic sites in the HLA-B locus makes
   sequencing an efficient way of detecting and analysing them. Most
   polymorphic sites are located in the alpha1 and alpha2 domains of the
   molecule, encoded by exons 2 and 3 of the gene. An HLA-B-specific
   sequence-based typing (SBT) strategy was designed for routine
   application identifying the polymorphic sites in these domains. Exons 2
   and 3 were amplified separately using amplification primers located in
   intron 1, intron 2 and intron 3. Separate amplification of exons 2 and 3
   resulted in short polymerase chain reacting (PCR) products and enabled a
   solid-phase sequencing approach, which made correct assignment of
   heterozygous positions possible due to low background. A one-step
   sequencing reaction was performed using fluorescent dye-labelled
   sequencing primers. One forward sequencing reaction was performed for
   exon 2, whereas for exon 3, two forward sequencing reactions were needed
   using two different sequencing primers located in intron 2 and exon 3.
   The combined sequences of exon 2 and 3 were used for automatic alignment
   to an HLA-B sequence database and automatic allele assignment. A total
   of 355 individuals with at least one allele belonging to the B7
   cross-reacting group (B7, 13, 22, 27, 40, 41, 42, 47, 48, 81 and 82)
   were typed for HLA-B by SET. In the B7 group 48 different alleles were
   identified, in the non-B7 group a further 59 alleles were sequenced, 9
   new alleles were identified. The sequencing strategy described has
   proven to be reliable and efficient for high-resolution HLA-B typing.}},

Abstract = {{DNA-mediated immunization was assessed in a murine model of equine
   herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) abortion. Whilst there are differences between the
   model and natural infection in the horse, literature suggests that EHV-1
   infection of pregnant mice can be used to assess the potential ability
   of vaccine candidates to protect against abortion. Female BALB/c mice
   were inoculated twice, 4 weeks apart, with an expression vector encoding
   EHV-1 glycoprotein D (gD DNA). They were mated 15 days after the second
   inoculation, challenged at day 15 of pregnancy and killed 3 days later.
   The go DNA-inoculated mice had fewer foetuses which were damaged or had
   died in utero (6\% in gD DNA, 21\% vector DNA and 28\% in nil inoculated
   groups challenged with EHV-1), a reduction in the stunting effect of
   EHV-1 infection on foetuses (gD DNA: 0.40g +/- 0.06, vector DNA: 0.34g
   +/- 0.10), reduced placental and herpesvirus-specific lung
   histopathology and a lower titre of virus (TCID50+/-SEM/lung) in
   maternal lung than control groups (gD DNA 4.7 +/- 0.3, vector 5.3 +/-
   0.2, nil 5.6 +/- 0.2). Maternal antibody to EHV-1 gD was demonstrated in
   pups born to a dam inoculated 123 days earlier with go DNA. Although
   protection from abortion was incomplete, immunization of mice with go
   DNA demonstrated encouragingly the potential of this vaccine strategy.

Abstract = {{Lindane, the gamma isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), is one of the
   oldest synthetic pesticides still in use worldwide. Numerous reports
   have shown that this pesticide adversely affects reproductive function
   in animals. Although the pathogenesis of reproductive dysfunction is not
   yet fully understood, recent reports indicate that lindane can directly
   inhibit adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis. Because Leydig cells play a
   pivotal role in male reproductive function through the production of
   testosterone, the mouse MA-10 Leydig tumor cell line was used to assess
   the potential effects of gamma-HCH and its isomers, alpha-HCH and
   delta-HCH, on steroid production, steroidogenic enzyme expression and
   activity, and steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein expression.
   StGR mediates the rate-limiting and acutely regulated step in
   hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis, the intramitochondrial transfer of
   cholesterol to the P450(SCC) enzyme. Our studies demonstrate that
   alpha-, delta-, and gamma-HCH inhibited dibutyryl ({[}Bu](2))
   cAMP-stimulated progesterone production in MA-10 cells in a dosage
   dependent manner without affecting general protein synthesis; and
   protein kinase A or steroidogenic enzyme expression, activity, or both.
   In contrast, each of these isomers dramatically reduced
   (Bu)(2)cAMP-stimulated StAR protein levels. Therefore, our results are
   consistent with the hypothesis that alpha-, delta-, and gamma-HCH
   inhibited steroidogenesis by reducing StAR protein expression, an action
   that may contribute to the pathogenesis of lindane-induced reproductive
   dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{Gene transfer to differentiated airway epithelia with existing viral
   vectors is very inefficient when they are applied to the apical surface.
   This largely reflects the polarized distribution of receptors on the
   basolateral surface. To identify new receptor-ligand interactions that
   might be used to redirect vectors to the apical surface, we investigated
   the process of infection of airway epithelial cells by human coronavirus
   2293 (HCoV-229E), a common cause of respiratory tract infections. Using
   immunohistochemistry, we found the receptor for HCoV-229E (CD13 or
   aminopeptidase N) localized mainly to the apical surface of airway
   epithelia, When HCoV-229E was applied to the apical or basolateral
   surface of well-differentiated primary cultures of human airway
   epithelia, infection primarily occurred from the epical side. Similar
   results were noted when the virus was applied to cultured human tracheal
   explants. Newly synthesized virions were released mainly to the apical
   side. Thus, HCoV-229E preferentially infects human airway epithelia from
   the apical surface. The spike glycoprotein that mediates HCoV-229E
   binding and fusion to CD13 is a candidate for pseudotyping retroviral
   envelopes or modifying other viral vectors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents novel approach on applying the standard observer
   based fault detection technique to the change detection of the output
   probability density functions for dynamic stochastic systems. For such
   systems, the control inputs of the system appear as a set of variables
   in the probability density functions of the system output, and these
   variables affect the shape of the probability density function of the
   system output. Using the B-splines approximation theory, the measured
   probability density functions of the system output are represented by a
   set of weights which are functions of the control inputs to the system.
   This leads to a unique expression of the dynamic characteristics of the
   output probability density functions for the system. Using this
   expression, it has been shown that standard observer based fault
   detection technique can be used to detect any unexpected changes caused
   by the additive type of fault in the dynamic part of the system. In
   specific, two observers are constructed for the fault detection
   purposes, where the first observer is based on the linear weighted
   integration of the output probability density functions whilst the
   second observer uses the non-linear residual signal generated from the
   integration of the output probability density functions. In both cases,
   the convergence of the observers have been proved under certain
   conditions when there is no fault in the system. An applicability study
   to the detection of unexpected changes of particle size (i.e.
   flocculation size) in paper-making is included to demonstrate the use of
   the proposed algorithm and desired results have been obtained.}},

   c acid were synthesized. Their protonation constants were determined by
   potentiometric titration in 0.10 M Me4NNO3 and by NMR pH titration at
   25.0 +/- 0.1 degreesC. The formations of lanthanide(III), copper(II),
   zinc(II) and calcium(II) complexes were investigated quantitatively by
   potentiometry. The stability constant for Gd(III) complex is larger than
   those for Ca(II), Zn(II) and Cu(II) complexes with these two ligands.
   The selectivity constants and modified selectivity constants of the
   DTPA-H1P and DTPA-H2P for Gd(III) over endogenously available metal ions
   were calculated. Comparing pM values at physiological pH 7.4 assesses
   effectiveness of these two ligands in binding divalent and trivalent
   metal ions in biological media. The observed water proton relaxivity
   values of {[}Gd(DTPA-HIP)](-) and {[}Gd(DTPA-H2P)](-) became constant
   with respect to pH changes over the range of 4-10. O-17 NMR shifts
   showed that the {[}Dy(DTPA-HIP)](-) and {[}DY(DTPA-H2P)](-) complexes at
   pH 6.30 had 1.91 and 2.28 inner-sphere water molecules, respectively.
   Water proton spin-lattice relaxation rates of {[}Gd(DTPA-H1P)](-) and
   {[}Gd(DTPA-H2P)](-) complexes were also consistent with the inner-sphere
   Gd(III) coordination.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Methods: In order to elucidate the underlying adjusting
   mechanism of human right coronary arterial (RCA) flow to increased right
   ventricular pressure (RVP) in children, we recorded RCA flow velocity in
   24 pediatric cardiac patients at the orifice of its main trunk at the
   time of heart catheterization using the Doppler guidewire.
   Results: The ratio of diastolic flow (DF)/total flow (TF), or the
   proportion of the DF time integral over a total of one cardiac cycle,
   had a negative correlation with heart rate (HR; r=-0.58, n=11) in
   children with normal right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP; RVSP <
   35 mmHg). In contrast, the DF/TF ratio had a good correlation (r=0.88,
   n=24) with RVSP in all patients under study. The ratio of diastolic area
   (DA)/total area (TA), defined as the ratio of an area encircled by the
   aortic pressure curve above and the RVP curve below for diastole, over a
   total of one cardiac cycle, representing the overall effect of both HR
   and transcoronary pressure difference, also correlated well (r=0.89,
   n=24) with DF/TF. Total volume flow of the RCA also increased (r=0.76,
   n=24) with increases in RVSP, first by an increase in flow velocity
   through the RCA, during both systole and diastole, then by widening of
   the RCA lumen at very high pressures. These changes were initially more
   dependent on diastole with increasing RVSP because: (i) of a more marked
   augmentation of flow velocity in diastole compared with systole; and
   then (ii) of a significant decrease in flow velocity in systole at very
   high pressures.
   Conclusions: We clarify how the RCA manages to increase flow through it
   at different HR as a function of chronic RVP overload in pediatric
   cardiac patients.}},

   25 CH patients (6.00-10.83 years of age) detected by neonatal screening,
   and 34 healthy control children (4-11 years of age). Patients and
   controls had comparable scores at neuropsychological tests (WISC-R), and
   at auditory P300 tests. In contrast, we found significantly longer LLSEP
   latencies in CH patients (p < 0.03). CH patients treated 30 days after
   birth showed lower scores at neuropsychological tests, but not at
   neurophysiological tests, compared to patients who started the
   replacement therapy earlier. Patients with more severe fetal
   hypothyroidism (T4 levels at diagnosis <less than or equal to> 2 mug/dl)
   had lower neuropsychological scores, and similar neurophysiological
   results, compared with patients with moderate fetal hypothyroidism. The
   severity of fetal hypothyroidism and early treatment influence the

Abstract = {{Two types of recording media are investigated for the recording of thin
   and highly asymmetric holographic grating couplers: (1) commercial
   photoresists for thin surface relief gratings, and (2) dichromated
   gelatins (DCG). As a result of the investigations on the photoresists
   (Shipley S1805), we found that very high diffraction efficiencies (DE)
   of over 80\% are obtained into the first order, when reconstructed at
   optimal geometrical conditions diffracting the output beam into free
   space with visible light at 514nm. However, when readout is at normal
   incidence and the output beam is diffracted into the substrate, two
   significant changes occur. Namely, the incident light is now diffracted
   into both diffracted first orders, with a ratio varying between about 2
   and 6 between the two first orders, depending on the exposure energy.
   The angular bandwidths of these thin blazed gratings were very large (>
   30 degrees); yet in a double grating substrate-mode configuration, the
   bandwidth was significantly reduced to about 10 degrees, indicating that
   the resultant DE is the product of the DEs of the two gratings. The DCG
   layers and processing procedures, which were optimized for recording at
   514 MI in thin layers of 2-3 mum yielded the highest DEs, approaching
   90\%, indicating that relatively large refractive index modulations,
   reaching at least 0.05 are stored in these materials. Under
   substrate-mode conditions, we obtain DEs of over 70\% into only one
   first order. As expected, these thin holographic volume (Bragg) grating
   couplers exhibited large angular bandwidths. As the bandwidths did not
   exhibit any significant exposure dependence, this indicates that in the
   investigated exposure ranges (50-100mJ/cm(2)) the gratings are recorded
   within the entire depth of the DCG layer. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper describes a systematic study of coplanar waveguide
   discontinuities that are requisite components of high-frequency
   distribution networks. The specific geometries addressed are air
   bridges, right-angle bends, tee junctions, and Wilkinson dividers.
   Relative to typical monolithic-microwave integrated-circuit designs, the
   components studied herein are electrically large in order to minimize
   signal attenuation. The large size leads to pronounced parasitic
   effects, and the emphasis of this study was to optimize the electrical
   performance using simple compensation techniques. The optimization
   methods are developed using full-wave simulation and equivalent-circuit
   modeling, and are verified experimentally up to 60 GHz. Part IT of this
   paper describes the implementation and packaging of the components to
   realize a three-dimensional W-band distribution network.}},

Abstract = {{A companion paper describes a discrete-event simulation model that
   captures the processing of wafers through a next-generation X-ray
   lithography area employing multiple synchrotrons as the source of
   exposure radiation. The model incorporates the best current information
   on unit-cell design and processing times; implements the spectrum of
   events that interrupt the flow of wafers processing on the cell; and
   provides estimates of weekly throughput for the cell and the frequency
   of SEMI E-10 equipment states for the corresponding exposure tool. In
   this paper we apply the model to compare the performance of cells
   fabricating 200 mm wafers with that of cells fabricating 300 mm wafers.
   Results illustrate the dependence of average wafer throughput on lot
   size, exposure times, and assumptions regarding the number of die per
   wafer For fixed assumptions regarding differential lot;sizes for
   different wafer diameters, maximum throughput of wafers is achieved for
   200 mm wafers with 25 X 25 mm held size. Ignoring wafer-sort losses,
   however, a maximum throughput of chips is realized for 300 mm wafers
   with 22 X 22 mm fields with 11 X 22 devices. Remarkably, the
   distribution of equipment states remains relatively unchanged across
   simulation experiments. These results suggest a useful analytical
   approximation for cell performance. When calibrated against the
   simulation results, this static model reinforces the conclusion that,
   all else being equal, acceptable throughput can be achieved for 300 mm
   wafers using the smaller wafer lots required to maintain acceptable
   cycle times.}},

Abstract = {{GluR3 autoantibodies have been implicated in the development of
   Rasmussen's encephalitis, a rare neurodegenerative disease of humans
   characterized by epilepsy and degeneration of a single cerebral
   hemisphere. GluR3 autoantibodies are found in some Rasmussen's
   encephalitis patients, and GluR3 antibodies raised in rabbits destroy
   cultured cortical cells in a complement-dependent manner. In this study,
   the cellular targets of anti-GluR3 antisera-mediated cytotoxicity were
   examined in mixed primary neuronal-glial cultures of rat cortex.
   Unexpectedly, astrocytes were the principal target of the cytotoxic
   effects as assessed by immunohistochemistry and lactate dehydrogenase
   activity; neurons were destroyed to a lesser extent. Astrocyte
   vulnerability was rescued by transfection with complement regulatory
   proteins, and neuronal resistance was defeated by impairing complement
   regulatory protein function. Astrocyte death may occur in Rasmussen's
   encephalitis, and destruction of this cell type may play a critical role
   in the progression of this disorder. The present findings suggest
   complement regulatory protein expression may in part determine the
   nature and severity of Rasmussen's encephalitis and other
   complement-dependent nervous system diseases and thus underscore the
   need for a systematic investigation of the expression of all known
   complement regulatory proteins in healthy and diseased nervous system

Abstract = {{Different strategies have been employed to achieve high-level expression
   of single-copy genes encoding secreted enzymes in Bacillus subtilis, A
   model system was developed which utilizes the aprL gene from Bacillus
   clausii as a reporter gene for monitoring expression levels during

   altering the nuceotide sequence in the -10 and -35 regions of the
   promoter for the amyQ gene of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. In addition,
   two or three tandem copies of this promoter were shown to increase
   expression levels substantially in comparison to the monomer promoter
   alone. Finally, the promoter and mRNA stabilization sequences derived
   from the cry3A gene of Bacillus thuringiensis were used in combination
   with the mutant amyQ promoter to achieve the highest levels of aprL
   expression, These promoters were shown to be fully functional in a
   high-expressing Bacillus strain grown under industrial fermentation
   conditions. The ability to obtain maximum expression levels from a
   single copy gene now makes it feasible to construct environmentally

   The platinum stud bump was leveled after bumping to have a smooth UBM
   surface for solder application. For solder application mechanical
   bumping of studs with Pb-Sn was used. After high-temperature storage at
   125 and 150 degreesC the phase formation of Pt-Sn intermetallics was
   investigated. The adhesion of the solder bumps was evaluated by shear

Abstract = {{Background: Testing for mutations of the TP53 gene in tumors is a
   valuable predictor for disease outcome in certain cancers, but the time
   and cost of conventional sequencing limit its use. The present study
   compares traditional; sequencing with the much faster microarray
   sequencing on a commercially available chip and describes a method to
   increase the Specificity of the chip.
   Methods: DNA from 140 human bladder tumors was extracted and subjected
   to a multiplex-PCR before loading onto the p53 GeneChip from Affymetrix.
   The same samples were previously sequenced by manual dideoxy sequencing.
   In addition, two cell lines with two different homozygous mutations at
   the TP53 gene locus were analyzed.
   Results: Of 1464 gene chip positions, each of which corresponded to an
   analyzed nucleotide in the sequence, 251 had background signals that
   were not attributable to mutations, causing the specificity of mutation
   calling without mathematical correction to be low. This problem was
   solved by regarding each chip position as separate entity with its own
   noise and threshold characteristics. The use of background plus 2 SD as
   the cutoff improved the specificity from 0.34 to 0.86 at the cost of a
   reduced sensitivity, from 0.92 to 0.84, leading to a much better
   concordance (92\%) with results obtained by traditional sequencing. The
   chip method detected as little as 1\% mutated DNA.
   Conclusions: Microarray-based sequencing is a novel option to assess
   TP53 mutations, representing a fast and inexpensive method compared with
   conventional sequencing. (C) 2000 American Association for Clinical

Abstract = {{Ecto-apyrase is a transmembrane glycoprotein that hydrolyzes
   extracellular nucleoside tri- or diphosphates. Apyrase activity is
   affected by several physiological and pathological conditions indicating
   the existence of regulatory mechanisms. Considering that apyrase
   presents consensus phosphorylation sites, we studied the phosphorylation
   of this enzyme. We found an overlay of the immunoblotting and
   phosphorylated bands in three different preparations from rat brain: (a)
   hippocampal slices, (b) synaptic plasma membrane fragments and (c)
   cultured astrocytes. In addition, two-dimensional electrophoresis
   separations with human astrocytoma cells were done to identify
   unequivocally the coincidence between the immunodetected and
   phosphorylated protein. These observations indicate that apyrase can be
   detected as a phosphoprotein, with obvious implications in the
   regulation of this enzyme.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the effects of aggressive warming and maintenance of
   normothermia on surgical blood loss and allogeneic transfusion
   requirement. We randomly assigned 150 patients undergoing total hip
   arthroplasty with spinal anesthesia to aggressive warming (to maintain a
   tympanic membrane temperature of 36.5 degrees C) or conventional warming
   (36 degrees C). Autologous and allogeneic blood were given to maintain a
   priori designated hematocrits. Blood loss was determined by a blinded
   investigator based on sponge weight and scavenged cells. postoperative
   loss was determined from drain output. Results were analyzed on an
   intention-to-treat basis. Average intraoperative core temperatures were
   wanner in the patients assigned to aggressive warming (36.5 degrees +/-
   0.3 degrees vs 36.1 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees C, P < 0.001). Mean arterial
   pressure was similar in each group preoperatively, but was greater
   intraoperatively in the conventionally warmed patients: 86 +/- 12 vs 80
   +/- 9 mm Hg, P < 0.001. Intraoperative blood loss was significantly
   greater in the conventional warming (618 mL; interquartile range,
   480-864 mL) than the aggressive warming group (488 mL; interquartile
   range, 368 -721 mL; P = 0.002), whereas postoperative blood loss did not
   differ in the two groups. Total brood loss during surgery and over the
   first two postoperative days was also significantly greater in the
   conventional warming group (1678 mL; interquartile range, 1366 -1965 mL)
   than in the aggressively warmed group (1,531 mL; interquartile range,
   1055-1746 mL, P = 0.031). A total of 40 conventionally warmed patients
   required 86 units of allogeneic red blood cells, whereas 29 aggressively
   warmed patients required 62 units (P = 0.051 and 0.061, respectively).
   We conclude that aggressive intraoperative warming reduces blood loss
   during hip arthroplasty.}},

Abstract = {{The Protein Annotators' Assistant (or PAA) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/paa/)
   is a software system which assists protein annotators in the task of
   assigning functions to newly sequenced proteins. Working backward from
   SwissProt, a database which describes known proteins, and a prior
   sequence similarity search that returns a list of known proteins similar
   to a query, PAA suggests keywords and phrases which may describe
   functions performed by the query. In a preprocessing step, a database is
   built from the protein names that appear in the SwissProt database, and
   against each protein are listed key words and phrases that are extracted
   from the corresponding text records. Common words either in general
   English usage or from the biological domain are removed as the phrases
   are assembled, This process is assisted by the use of a simple stemming
   algorithm, which extends the list of stop-words (i.e., reject words),
   together with a list of accept-words. At runtime, the search algorithm,
   invoked by a user via a Web interface, takes a list of protein names and
   clusters the named proteins around keywords/phrases shared by members of
   the list. The assumption is that if these proteins have a particular
   keyword/phrase in common, and they are related to a query protein, then
   the keyword/phrase may also describe the query. Overall, PAA employs a
   number of in techniques in a novel setting and is thus related to text
   categorization, where multiple categories may be suggested, except that
   in this case none of the categories are specified in advance.}},

Abstract = {{All students at the University of Richmond School of Law are required to
   complete a first-year course in Environmental Law, as an introduction to
   the strategies and technicalities of statutory and regulatory regimes.
   This requirement poses special pedagogical challenges for the
   instructors. How, for example, is the class to address pollution
   questions regarding diverse media? Which of the many federal and
   nonfederal statutory provisions deserve the most (and least attention)?
   How does the instructor hold the attention of, and gain the most
   effective work product from, students whose major interests lie outside
   the area of Environmental Law? What is the proper mix of statutory,
   regulatory, and judge-made (pre- and post-regulatory) law?
   Our solution has been to craft a unique combination of traditional
   lectures and readings regarding specific statutes, regulations, and case
   law; weekly discussion questions that immerse the students in the
   intricacies of statutory and regulatory provisions; a series of
   small-group simulations designed to highlight substantive legal points
   and to place the students in a wide range of legal and extralegal
   settings (client interviews, appellate argument, advocacy before
   administrative bodies, negotiation, lobbying public officials,
   legislative drafting); and periodic written assignments that focus the
   students' attention on technical legal and public policy issues.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has revealed positive effects of unsteady flow on the
   development of boundary layers in turbine cascades especially at
   conditions with a laminar suction side separation bubble at low Reynolds
   numbers. Compared to steady flow, a reduction of total pressure loss
   coefficient over a broad range of Reynolds numbers has been shown.
   Taking into account the positive effects of wake-induced transition
   already during the design process, new high lift bladings with nearly
   the same low losses at unsteady inlet flow conditions could be achieved.
   This lends to a reduction of weight and cost of the whole turbine module
   for a constant stage loading. Unsteady flow in turbomachines is caused
   by the relative motion of rotor and stator rows. For simulating a moving
   blade row upstream of a linear cascade in the High-Speed Cascade Wind
   Tunnel of the Universitat der Bundeswehr Munchen, a wake generator has
   been designed and built. The wakes are generated with bars, moving with
   a velocity of up to 40 m/s in the test section upstream of the cascade
   inlet plane. Unsteady flow causes the transition on the surface of the
   suction side of a low-pressure turbine blade to move upstream whenever
   an incoming wake is present on the surface; moreover a laminar
   separation bubble can be diminished or even, suppressed In order to
   detect the effects of wakes on the boundary layer development a new hot
   wire data acquisition system is required. Due to the fact that hot wires
   give a good insight into boundary layer development, a new hot-wire data
   acquisition system has been set up. The anemometry system can acquire
   four channels simultaneously, therefore being capable of logging a
   triple hot-wire sensor and a bar trigger simultaneously. One further
   channel is utilized for a once-per-revolution trigger. The
   once-per-revolution trigger is used to start the measurement of one data
   block. Using the well-established ensemble-averaging technique, 300
   ensembles each consisting of five wake passing periods have been
   acquired. Ensemble averaging can be directly performed without any data
   reduction. The adaptation of this new hot-wire anemometry data
   acquisition system to the High-Speed Cascade Wind Tunnel of the
   Universitat der Bundeswehr Munchen is pointed out. First, results on
   unsteady periodic boundary layer development of a highly loaded
   low-pressure turbine cascade under unsteady inlet flow conditions are
   presented. During the present investigation four boundary layer
   traverses, ranging from x/l(ax) = 0.82 to x/l(ax) = 0.99 (suction side),

Abstract = {{Germ cell tumor (GCT) is one of the few malignancies in which recurrent
   patients would have a good chance of cure by chemotherapy. Using
   semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for
   a-fetoprotein (afp) mRNA, we measured the circulating tumor load in 54
   peripheral blood samples from 7 GCT patients at diagnosis and 47 healthy
   controls. Clinicopathological information of GCT patients was obtained
   during a 12-month follow-up. As compared to the upper limit among
   healthy controls, afp mRNA levels increased 23-3.4x10(3)-fold
   pretreatment in all 7 patients, and 2.8x10(3)-1.4x10(4)-fold
   posttreatment in 2 patients studied. All 7 patients with substantially
   elevated afp mRNA levels developed recurrence or metastasis within 12
   months of diagnosis. We present evidence that afp-expressing tumor cells
   disseminating in GCT patients before treatment may possibly be the
   source of recurrence or metastasis. Sequential quantification of afp
   mRNA during the clinical course may provide crucial information for
   identifying GCT patients at high risk for metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{Mutational analysis of 30 recurrent known mutations detects only about
   58\% of Hispanic cystic fibrosis (CF) chromosomes. The low mutation
   detection rate has greatly hindered prenatal diagnosis and carrier
   testing of Hispanic families who have multiple affected children with
   unidentified cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
   mutations. We recently employed a temporal temperature gradient gel
   electrophoresis (TTGE) method to effectively scan unknown mutations in
   the entire CFTR gene. A novel mutation, 2105-2117 dell3insAGAAA was
   identified in a Hispanic family heterozygous for Delta F508. The
   discovery of the devastating mutation facilitated the prenatal diagnosis
   for this family who already had two severely affected children. The
   fetus was found to be a compound heterozygote of Delta F508/2105-2117
   dell3insAGAAA. This case emphasizes the importance of whole gene
   mutational analysis in patients with a clinical diagnosis of CF, but
   without the identifiable DNA mutations by routine mutation analysis.
   Finding of CF mutations in the patient would allow proper genetic
   counselling and prenatal and carrier detection of at-risk family
   members. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{For the purposes of this paper, a distribution is sub-exponential if it
   has finite variance but its moment generating function is infinite on at
   least one side of the origin. The principal aim here is to study the
   relative error properties of the bootstrap approximation to the true
   distribution function of the sample mean in the important
   sub-exponential cases. Our results provide a fairly general description
   of how the bootstrap approximation breaks down in the tail when the
   underlying distribution is subexponential and satisfies some very mild
   additional conditions. The broad conclusion we draw is that the accuracy
   of the bootstrap approximation in the tail depends, in a rather
   sensitive way, on the precise tail behaviour of the underlying
   distribution. Our results are applied to several sub-exponential
   distributions, including the lognormal. The lognormal case is of
   particular interest because, as the simulation studies of Lee and Young
   have shown, bootstrap confidence intervals can have very poor coverage
   accuracy when applied to data from the lognormal.}},

Abstract = {{A strengthening mechanism for sol-gel derived nano-porous silica films
   was studied. The silica films were prepared with the dip method from
   two-step catalyzed silica sols and treated in a mixed atmosphere of
   ammonia and water vapor afterwards. Properties of the films were
   analyzed by using atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier-transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ellipsometry and an abrasion test,
   respectively. The experimental results have shown that the two-step
   catalysis strengthens the films and the scratch resistance of the silica
   films is further improved after treatment in the mixed gas. The increase
   in strength is attributed to the cross-linking of silica particles by
   randomly branched or/and entangled linear chains in the sols, more
   Si-O-Si bonds formed by the mixed gas treatment and structural changes
   in the silica films. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   cross-linking process which, in turn, induces liquid crystal alignment
   on the discotic film surface. The polarity of discotic compounds plays
   an important role in affecting the pretilt angle of the liquid crystal
   alignment. A pretilt angle of 1 +/- 0.4 degrees was obtained using
   single exposure at oblique angle. Potential application of this new
   photo-alignment film for low temperature poly-silicon

Abstract = {{Expression of the bovine papillomavirus E2 protein in cervical carcinoma
   cells represses expression of integrated human papillomavirus (BPV)
   E6/E7 oncogenes, followed by repression of the cdc25A gene and other
   cellular genes required for cell cycle progression, resulting in
   dramatic growth arrest. To explore the mechanism of repression of cell
   cycle genes in cervical carcinoma cells following E6/E7 repression, we
   analyzed regulation of the cdc25A promoter, which contains two consensus
   E2F binding sites and a consensus E2 binding site. The wild-type E2
   protein inhibited expression of a luciferase gene linked to the cdc25A
   promoter in HT-3 cervical carcinoma cells. Mutation of the distal E2F
   binding site in the cdc25A promoter abolished E2-induced repression,
   whereas mutation of the proximal E2F site or the E2 site had no effect.
   None of these mutations affected the activity of the promoter in the
   absence of E2 expression. Expression of the E2 protein also led to
   posttranscriptional increase in the level of E2F4, p105(Rb), and p130
   and induced the formation of nuclear E2F4-p130 and E2F4-p105(Rb)
   complexes. This resulted in marked rearrangement of the protein
   complexes that formed at the distal E2F site in the cdc25A promoter,
   including the replacement of free E2F complexes with E2F4-p105(Rb)
   complexes. These experiments indicated that repression of E2F-responsive
   promoters following HPV E6/E7 repression was mediated by activation of
   the Rb tumor suppressor pathway and the assembly of repressing E2F4-Rb
   DNA binding complexes. Importantly, these experiments revealed that
   HPV-induced alterations in E2F transcription complexes that occur during
   cervical carcinogenesis are reversed by repression of HPV E6/E7
   expression.}},

Abstract = {{A piezoelectric quartz crystal (PQC) impedance method based on the
   alpha-amylase-catalyzed hydrolysis of starch:present in a culture medium
   has been developed for in situ monitoring of the whole growth process of
   Bacillus subtilis and the variation in the activity of alpha-amylase
   during bacterial growth. An S-shaped response behavior was observed for
   Delta f(0), and simultaneously inverse S-shaped responses were found for
   Delta R-1 and Delta L-1. The ratio of Delta R-1 to Delta f(0) or Delta
   L-1 coincided well with that calculated from Martin's equations
   reflecting the solution density-viscosity effect, suggesting that the
   continuing change in liquid loading onto the PQC surface causes
   significant variation in Delta f(0), Delta R-1, and Delta L-1. Bacterial
   growth equations were derived from-the kinetics of the enzyme-catalyzed
   hydrolysis of starch, which fit well with the experimental responses of
   Delta f(0), Delta R-1, and Delta L-1. Kinetic parameters of bacterial
   growth, including the asymptote (A), the maximum specific growth rate
   (mu(m)), and the lag time (lambda), were obtained and were in good
   agreement with those obtained from the pour plate count method. The
   variation in the activity of alpha-amylase exhibited peak-type behavior
   with its maximum value at the later stage of the log phase. In addition,
   the influence of initial bacterial concentration was also investigated.

   with reduced tumour necrosis factor alpha production}},

Abstract = {{Background: Preoperative portal vein embolization successfully reduces
   the incidence of postoperative hepatic failure in which endotoxin is
   postulated to be involved. To identify the mechanism of this preventive
   effect, the relationship of endotoxin-induced liver injury with tumour
   necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and nitric oxide production in the
   peripheral blood, liver and spleen of rats subjected to preoperative
   portal vein branch ligation (PVL) was compared with that in rats
   undergoing sham operation.
   Methods: Rats with PVL and those that underwent sham operation were
   subjected to resection of ligated liver lobes (PVL-Hx rats) and
   two-thirds hepatectomy (noPVL-Hx rats) respectively at day 5, followed
   by intravenous administration of endotoxin 200 mu g/kg body-weight at
   day 7. At various time intervals after endotoxin injection, the
   peripheral blood, liver and spleen tissues were harvested and analysed
   for TNF-alpha and nitric oxide production.
   Results: The survival rates of noPVL-Hx and PVL-Hx rats at 48 h after
   endotoxin administration were 40 and 100 per cent respectively. The
   former rats showed more extensive liver injury as represented by higher
   serum aminotransferase and hyaluronate levels than the latter. Plasma
   concentrations of TNF-alpha at 1.5 h after endotoxin treatment were
   significantly higher in noPVL-Hx rats (mean(s.e.m.) 22125(2175) pg/ml;
   n=6) than PVL-Hx rats (8344(4076)pg/ml; n=6) (P < 0.01). Consistent with
   this, expression of TNF-alpha messenger RNA in the liver and spleen was
   suppressed in PVL-Hx rats. In two-thirds hepatectomized rats, plasma
   TNF-alpha concentrations after endotoxin administration at 1, 2 and 3
   days (14350(2186), 26375(2478) and 23000(3745)pg/ml respectively; n=6
   each) were significantly higher than that before operation
   (9067(1559)pg/ml; n=6) (P < 0.05), whereas those at 5 and 7 days
   (10102(3616) and 8580(1427)pg/ml respectively; n=6 each) showed no
   significant increase. Furthermore, nitric oxide production in peripheral
   blood and liver was suppressed by preoperative PVL.
   Conclusion: Prevention of endotoxin-induced liver failure by
   preoperative PVL is associated with reduced production of TNF-alpha in
   the later phase of liver regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Periodontal surgery stimulates osteoclast activity, leading
   to varying amounts of alveolar crest loss. We have established that
   topical application of 20 mg/ml of alendronate placed at the surgical
   mucoperiosteal site produced a striking reduction of alveolar bone loss
   in the rat model. The aim of this investigation;was to examine the
   antiresorptive efficacy of 3 novel bisacylphosphonates topically
   delivered at the surgical site, in comparison to alendronate and
   etidronate which are in clinical use.
   Methods: Mucoperiosteal flap (MF) surgery was; performed on the buccal
   and lingual aspects next to molars on both sides of the rat mandible. A
   gelatin sponge soaked in the bisphosphonate solution prepared by
   dissolving 20 mg of the bisphosphonate (alendronate, etidronate, VS-5,
   VS-6, ISA-13, SuBP) in 1 mi of saline was applied to exposed bone on the
   right side of the mandible (experimental, MF + BPs) and the left, side
   was treated with saline only (control, MF + S). Sections were evaluated
   for bone loss using microradiography pattern and amount.
   Results: The 3 novel bisacylphosphonates, VS-5 VS-6, and ISA-13 were
   more effective than etidronate, and less effective than alendronate, The
   most effective among this group was ISA-13 followed by VS-5 and VS-6,
   Conclusion: We conclude that ISA-13-like alendronate is effective in
   reducing alveolar bone loss when delivered at surgical sites. Since
   ISA-13 is well absorbed through mucose tissues, we suggest that ISA-13
   efficacy on reducing bone loss should be tested by its application on
   the mucosal tissue.}},

Abstract = {{The rate and degree of solvent extraction of chromium(III), which was
   produced by the reduction of chromium(VI) with ascorbic acid in 0.1 mol
   dm(-3) sodium nitrate solutions containing acetic acid/acetate ion as
   the buffer, were examined by using acetylacetone as the extractant and
   chloroform as the solvent. The rate of formation of an extractable
   acetylacetonato complex was greater than that when metal ion was added
   as hydrated Cr3+ until a certain amount of chromium(III) was extracted.
   Although the rate was first order with respect to the acetylacetone
   concentration and inverse first order with respect to the hydrogen-ion
   concentration, the extraction of chromium(III) formed in this way was
   dependent on the concentration of acetate ions in the aqueous solution.
   From these results, it was assumed that the chromium(III) produced from
   chromium(VI) formed a complex with an acetate ion just after the
   reduction occurred, and that the complex functions as a precursor to the
   extraction. The acetylacetone reacted with the precursor much more
   rapidly than the hydrated chromium(III) ion. From the change in the
   UV-vis spectrum of the complex and in the easiness of stripping of
   chromium(III) from chloroform with a nitric acid solution, the
   thus-formed extractable complex was assumed to be an intermediate which
   changed to a final complex similar to that obtained by the dissolution
   of crystals of tris(acetylacetonato)chromium(III) in chloroform.}},

Abstract = {{Bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma (BAC) is a type of lung adenocarcinoma
   characterized by growth along the alveolar wall. It is divided into two
   subtypes: sclerosing BAC (SBAC), which has central fibrosis, and
   non-sclerosing BAC (NSBAC), which lacks central fibrosis. We compared
   the genetic alterations in these two types of BAC with those in atypical
   adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH). There were 39 cases of SBAC, 19 of NSBAC
   and 20 of AAH. To detect the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) we used the
   microsatellite markers D3S1234 and D3S1300 on chromosome 3p, IFNA and
   D9S144 on 9p, and TP53 on 17p. We also used polymerase chain
   reaction-SSCP analysis and direct sequencing to examine a point mutation
   of the p53 gene at exons 5-8. At the TP53 locus, the frequencies of LOH
   showed a statistical rank-difference correlation among AAH, NSBAC and
   SBAC. On chromosomes 3p and 9p there were no statistical differences of
   LOH among AAH, NSBAC and SBAC. We detected a significant statistical
   rank-difference correlation in the p53 mutation among AAH, NSBAC and
   SBAC. These findings suggest that a process of multistep carcinogenesis
   from AAH through NSBAC to SBAC might occur in some cases of
   adenocarcinoma, and LOH of 3p and 9p might be an early event of
   carcinogenesis, while the p53 mutation might be a later event.}},

Abstract = {{The in vitro activities of the new triazole, ravuconazole (BMS-207147),
   were compared to those of fluconazole and itraconazole against 541
   clinical isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans. Isolates were obtained
   from cerebrospinal fluid (396), blood (116), and miscellaneous clinical
   specimens (29). Overall, ravuconazole (MIC at which 90\% of the isolates
   are inhibited {[}MIC90], 0.25 mu g/ml) was more active than either
   itraconazole (MIC90, 0.5 mu g/ml) or fluconazole (MIC90, 8 mu g/ml).
   Among the isolates inhibited by greater than or equal to 16 mu g of
   fluconazole/ml, 90.2\% were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 mu g of
   ravuconazole/ml. On the basis of our findings and the favorable
   pharmacokinetic properties of ravuconazole, we suggest that ravuconazole
   may be useful for the treatment of infectious diseases due to C.
   neoformans and that further clinical studies to confirm these promising
   in vitro results are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Herbicide use can be reduced if the spatial distribution of weeds in the
   field is taken into account. This paper reports the initial stages of
   development of an image capture/processing system to detect weeds, as
   well as a fuzzy logic decision-making system to determine where and how
   much herbicide to apply in an agricultural field. The system used a
   commercially available digital camera and a personal computer. In the
   image processing stage, green objects in each image were identified
   using a greenness method that compared the red, green, and blue (RGB)
   intensities. The RGB matrix was reduced to a binary Form by applying the
   following criterion: if the green intensity of a pixel was greater than
   the red and the blue intensities, then the pixel was assigned a value of
   one; otherwise the pixel was given a value of zero. The resulting binary
   matrix was used to compute greenness area for weed coverage, and
   greenness distribution of weeds tweed patch). The values of weed
   coverage and weed patch were inputs to the fuzzy logic decision-making
   system, which used the membership functions to control the herbicide
   application rate at each location. Simulations showed that a graduated
   fuzzy strategy could potentially reduce herbicide application by 5 to
   24\%. and that an on/off strategy resulted in an even greater reduction
   of 15 to 64\%.}},

Abstract = {{We study a problem of adaptive estimation of a conditional probability
   function in a pattern recognition setting. In many applications, for
   more flexibility, one may want to consider various estimation procedures
   targeted at different scenarios and/or under different assumptions. For
   example, when the feature dimension is high, to overcome the familiar
   curse of dimensionality one may seek a good parsimonious model among a
   number of candidates such as CART, neural nets and additive models. For
   such a situation, one wishes to have an automated final procedure that
   performs as well as the best candidate.
   In this work, we propose a method to combine a countable collection of
   procedures for estimating the conditional probability. We show that the
   combined procedure has a property that its statistical risk is bounded
   above by that of any of the procedure being considered plus a small
   penalty. Thus asymptotically, the strengths of the different estimation
   procedures are shared by the combined procedure. A simulation study
   shows the potential advantage of combining models compared with model
   selection.}},

Abstract = {{A 3-D porosity field in a west Texas carbonate reservoir is modeled
   conditional to both ``hard{''} porosity data sampled by wells and 2-D
   seismic attribute map with less vertical resolution than the well log
   data. The difference-of-scales between the two sources of data is
   resolved by a prior 2-D estimation of vertically averaged porosity using
   well and seismic data. These 2-D estimates are then used to condition
   the 3-D stochastic simulation of porosity. The algorithm used to merge
   2-D average values and 3-D data values, i.e., to solve the
   difference-of-scale problem, is a form of block kriging, which ensures
   that vertical averages of the 3-D estimates reproduce exactly the 2-D
   average data values. The precision of the 2-D conditioning data is also
   addressed. Several new geostatistical algorithms, such as automatic
   covariance modeling and direct sequential simulation algorithms, are
   weaved into the application. These new algorithms facilitate the process
   of integration of the soft data in petrophysical modeling. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Point mutations in mitochondrial tRNA genes are responsible for
   individual subgroups of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, We have
   recently reported that point mutations in the tRNA(Leu)(UUR) and

   nucleotide of the anticodon, As part of a systematic analysis of
   pathogenic mutant mitochondrial tRNAs, we purified tRNA(lle) with a
   point mutation at nucleotide 4269 to determine its nucleotide sequence,
   including modified nucleotides, We found that, instead of causing a
   defect in the post-transcriptional modification, a pathogenic point
   mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA(lle) reduced the stability of the
   mutant tRNA molecule, resulting in a low steady-state level of
   aminoacyl-tRNA. The reduced stability was confirmed by examining the
   life-span of the mutant tRNA(lle) both in vitro and in vivo, as well as
   by monitoring its melting profile. Our finding indicates that the mutant

Abstract = {{Semiclassical electron-hydrogenic ion collisional excitation cross
   sections for 1s --> 2s and 1s --> 2p(0) in nonideal plasmas are
   obtained. An effective pseudopotential model taking into account the
   plasma screening and collective effects is applied to describe the
   electron-ion interaction potential in a classical nonideal plasma. The
   semiclassical straight-line trajectory approximation is applied to the
   motion of the projectile electron in order to investigate the variation
   of the total inelastic scattering cross section as a function of the
   projectile energy, nonideal plasma parameter, and Debye length. It is
   found that the transition probabilities in ideal plasmas described by
   the Debye-Huckel potential model are greater than those in nonideal
   plasmas described by the pseudopotential model. The maximum position of
   the transition probability gets closer to the target core as the
   projectile energy increases. It is also found that the scaled cross
   section decreases when the nonideal plasma parameter (gamma) is
   increased, i.e., the nonideality of plasmas reduces the electron-ion
   collision cross section. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Chip scale packages (CSP) have essential solder joint quality problems,
   and a board level reliability is a key issue in design and development
   of the CSP type packages. There has been an effort to eliminate Pb from
   solder due to its toxicology. To evaluate the various solder balls in
   CSP package applications, Pb-free Sn-Ag-X (X = In, Cu, Bi) and
   Sn-9Zn-1Bi-5In solder balls were characterized by melting behavior,
   phases, interfacial reaction, and solder joint reliability. For studying
   joint strength between solders and under bump metallurgy (UBM) systems,
   various UBMs were prepared by electroplating and electroless plating.
   After T/C (temperature cycle) test, Sn3.5Ag8.5In solder was partially
   corroded and its shape was distorted. This phenomenon was observed in a
   Sn3Ag10In1Cu solder system, too. Their fractured surface, microstructure
   of solder joint interface, and of bulk solder ball were examined and
   analyzed by optical microscopy, SEM and EDX. To simulate the real
   surface mounting condition and evaluate the solder joint reliability on
   board level, Daisy chain test samples using LF-CSP packages were
   prepared with various Pb-free solders, then a temperature cycle test
   (-65 similar to 150 degrees C) was performed. All tested Pb-free solders
   showed better board level solder joint reliability than Sn-36Pb-2Ag.
   Sn-3.5Ag-0.7Cu and Sn-9Zn-1Bi-5In solders showed 35\%, 100\% superior
   solder joint reliability than Sn-36Pb-2Ag solder ball, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A study of the characterization of the phenotypic patterns of
   Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from bovine subclinical mastitis
   in Israeli dairy herds and their correlation with the severity of the
   disease was undertaken. A total of 400 chronically S. aureus-infected
   Israeli-Holstein cows, from 15 dairy herds were included in this study.
   Based on the results of the biochemical reactions, of the anti-biogram
   and phage typing, one major type of S. aureus was determined in each
   herd, its prevalence being between 54 and 100\% of the total isolates
   from the same herd. The majority of the isolates were found to be
   non-haemolytic (62.7\%). The most common phage type was 3/A,3/C,55,71,
   which was predominant in five herds. In two herds none of the isolates
   (24) were typable by this set of phages. All isolates were susceptible
   to methicillin, erythromycin, cephalorin, norfloxacin,
   trimethoprin-sulphamethoxazole and novobiocin. Most isolates were
   resistant to penicillin (96.6\%) and 52\% to oxytetracyclin. Differences
   in protein patterns between 50 and 36 kDa were found by one-dimensional
   sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. No
   correlation between any combination of the phenotypic characteristics
   were found when correlation was done with milk yield and somatic cell
   count, corresponding to the 6 months before sampling. Otherwise, a
   positive correlation was found between type of haemolysis and the
   N-acetyl-beta -glucosaminidase (NAGase) values. In milk from quarters
   infected with the non-haemolytic strains, the level of NAGase was
   significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that from quarters infected with the
   haemolytic strains (69.7 and 105.9, respectively). However, the level of
   NAGase activity in the milk of the quarters infected with the
   non-haemolytic strains was significantly higher (P < 0.05) when compared
   to the milk of quarters infected with coagulase negative staphylococci
   (43.5).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper. a simplified in-plane permeability model for textile
   fabrics is developed. The model is based on a rectangular unit cell
   geometry, the one-dimensional Stokes equation for now in the channels or
   gaps between fiber tows, and the one-dimensional Brinkman equation for
   flow in fiber tows. Three different textile fabrics are considered in
   the model: plain woven, 4-harness, and bidirectional stitched fiberglass
   mats. The model incorporates the effect of porosity changes on
   permeability of fiber preforms under compression, which usually occurs
   in the molding process. To verify the validity of the model, the
   theoretical values are compared with a set of permeability measurements.
   Good agreement is found between the model prediction and the
   permeability measurements in the porosity ranges of phi less than or
   equal to 0.59 for plain woven fiber mats, phi less than or equal to 0.60

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{312-319}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Aims The monophasic action potential (MAP) is conventionally recorded
   using Ag-AgCl electrodes which are not suitable for delivering
   radiofrequency currents. To be able to use the sharp MAP upstroke for
   identifying the local activation, as a step towards the development of a
   MAP-guided catheter ablation technique, the possibility of recording MAP
   via platinum electrodes of an ordinary ablation catheter was explored.
   Methods and Results One hundred and forty-two MAP recordings from the
   endocardium were obtained via an ablation catheter in 40 patients
   undergoing electrophysiological study/catheter ablation. During sinus
   rhythm and pacing, 90\% of the ventricular and 100\% of the atrial MAPs
   had stable baselines. The amplitudes were 13+/-4.2 mV for ventricular
   and 2.4 +/- 0.8 mV for atrial MAPs. During mapping and ablation. MAPs
   and uni- and bipolar electrograms were recorded simultaneously using the
   same tip electrode in eight patients. The MAPs provided more distinct
   local activation than the electrograms. During 17 MAP recordings,
   additional MAPs were recorded simultaneously using an Ag-AgCl electrode
   catheter in the immediate vicinity of the ablation catheter. The MAPs
   taken with the ablation catheter had characteristics consistent with
   those taken with the Ag-AgCl catheter.
   Conclusions (1) Platinum electrodes can be used for timely recording of
   MAPs in patients. (2) It is feasible to record MAPs and deliver
   radiofrequency currents via the same platinum-tip electrode. These
   findings suggest that MAP-guided catheter ablation is technically
   possible. (Europace 2000; 2: 312-319) (C) 2000 The European Society of

Abstract = {{To elucidate the mechanism of sterility induced by gossypol:, we studied

   motility (HAM) and fertility in vivo were significantly inhibited when
   spermatozoa were exposed to gossypol (2.5 mug-60 mug/mL) for 15 min in

   weeks, sperm motility, HAM and rate of fertilization in vitro by the
   hamster cauda epididymal spermatozoa were significantly decreased and
   the extracts of testis delayed dispersion of the cumulus oophorus cells,
   suggesting that hyaluronidase and other acrosomal enzymes might be
   inhibited by gossypol. In addition, acrosin and arylsulfatase activities

Abstract = {{Activity of the Darkener of apricot (Doa) locus of Drosophila
   melanogaster is required for development of the embryonic nervous
   system, segmentation, photoreceptor maintenance, normal
   transcription,:and sexual differentiation. The gene encodes a protein
   kinase, with homologues throughout eukaryotes known as the LAMMER
   kinases. We show here that DOA is expressed as at least two different
   protein isoforms of 105 and 55 kD throughout development, which are
   primarily localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively. Doa
   transcripts and protein are expressed in all cell types both during
   embryogenesis and in imaginal discs. Although it was recently shown that
   DOA kinase is essential for normal sexual differentiation, levels of
   both kinase isoforms are equal between the sexes during early pupal
   development. The presence of the kinase on the cell membrane and in the
   nuclei of polytene salivary gland cells, as well as exclusion from the
   nuclei of specific cells, may be indicative of regulated kinase
   localization. Mosaic analysis in both the soma and germline demonstrates
   that Doa function is essential for cell viability. Finally, in contrast
   to results reported in other systems and despite some phenotypic
   similarities, genetic data demonstrate that the LAMMER kinases do not
   participate in the ras-MAP kinase signal transduction pathway.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the effect of hot-wet aging on the properties of a
   glass-reinforced epoxy resin, three kinds of specimens were subjected to
   static and dynamic (fatigue) tests, in both dry and moisture-saturated
   conditions. Although a reduction of both elastic properties and
   strengths was found, it seems that hygrothermal aging has no effect on
   the S-N fatigue behavior when the part at low loads is considered. It is
   proposed that there is a balance between the damage generated by
   micro-effects (such as fiber damaging, resin micro-cracking or
   micro-crazing) and the increased energy dissipation capability of the
   resin generated by the absorbed moisture. The first kind of behavior is
   dominant at high loads (low number of cycles: i.e., the static
   situation), while the second is more important where a high number of
   cycles is concerned.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive research has shown that the act of play is extremely important
   in the lives of human beings. It is thus not surprising that games have
   a long and continuing history in the development of almost every culture
   and society. The advent of computers and technology in general has also
   been akin to the need for entertainment that every human being seeks.
   However, a curious dichotomy exists in the nature of electronic games:
   the vast majority of electronic games are individual in nature whereas
   the non-electronic ones are collective by nature. On the other hand,
   recent technological breakthroughs are finally allowing for the
   implementation of electronic multiplayer games.
   Because of the limited experience in electronic, multiplayer game
   design, it becomes necessary to adapt existing expertise in the area of
   single-player game design to the realm of multiplayer games. This work
   presents a model to support the initial steps in the design process of
   multiplayer games. The model is defined in terms of the characteristics
   that are both inherent and special to multiplayer games but also related
   to the relevant elements of a game in general. Additionally, the model
   is used to assist in the design of two multiplayer games.

Abstract = {{We have shown that membrane sphingomyelin (SM) is an independent
   predictor of the variance of fasting plasma insulin (FPI) concentrations
   and the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) estimate of insulin
   resistance in obese women. The peroxisome proliferator-activated
   receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) is a key component in adipocyte
   differentiation that may also contribute to the sensitivity of cells to
   insulin. PPAR-gamma is activated by fatty acids, and the membrane
   composition may have an impact on the activity of PPAR-gamma and thus on
   the sensitivity of adipocytes to insulin. We investigated these possible
   links by determining the phospholipid contents of adipocyte membranes,
   the mRNA expression of PPAR-gamma, and the FPI and HOMA estimate of
   insulin resistance in obese women. The mRNA levels of tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which is suspected to play a role in insulin
   resistance and which downregulates PPAR-gamma expression, were also
   quantified. FPI and HOMA were strongly positively correlated with
   membrane SM (P < 0.005) and cholesterol (P < 0.005). PPAR-gamma mRNA
   levels were negatively correlated with FPI (P < 0.05) and HOMA (P <
   0.05) and positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
   cholesterol (P < 0.05), membrane SM (P < 0.05), and cholesterol contents
   (P < 0.05). TNF-alpha mRNA levels were not correlated with membrane
   parameters. In stepwise multiple regression analysis, the variations in
   PPAR-gamma mRNA levels were mainly explained by HDL cholesterol (31.9\%)
   and membrane SM (17.7\%). Our study shows that the expression of
   PPAR-gamma, a major factor controlling adipocyte functions, the lipid
   composition of the membrane, and insulin sensitivity are probably
   closely associated in the adipose tissue of obese women.}},

Abstract = {{In birds and frogs, species pairs retain the capacity to produce viable
   hybrids for tens of millions of years, an order of magnitude longer than
   mammals. What accounts for these differences in relative rates of
   pre-and postzygotic isolation? We propose that reproductive mode is a
   critically important but previously overlooked factor in the speciation
   process. Viviparity creates a post-fertilization arena for genomic
   conflicts absent in egg-laying species. With viviparity, conflict can
   arise between: mothers and embryos; sibling embryos in the womb, and
   maternal and paternal genomes within individual embryos. Such intra- and
   intergenomic conflicts result in perpetual antagonistic coevolution,
   thereby accelerating interpopulation postzygotic isolation. In addition,
   by generating intrapopulation genetic incompatibility, viviparity-driven
   conflict favors polyandry and limits the potential for precopulatory
   divergence. Mammalian diversification is characterized by rapid
   evolution of incompatible fete-maternal interactions, asymmetrical
   postzygotic isolation, disproportionate effects of genomically-imprinted
   genes, and ``F-2 hybrid enhancement.{''} The viviparity-driven conflict
   hypothesis provides a parsimonious explanation for these patterns in
   mammalian evolution. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Background: Chronic prostatic pain is still a diagnostic and therapeutic
   problem. The clinical observation that prostatic and pelvic pain is
   accompanied by motoric and sensoric disorders of the pelvic floor
   muscles led to the hypothesis that prostatic pain roots in a changed
   processing of afferent and efferent information with the central nervous
   system (CNS).
   Methods: Neuro-urological work-up of 11 male patients with chronic
   prostatic pain was completed. This included a clinical evaluation of
   pelvic floor function, urodynamic investigation of bladder and urethra
   function and a cystoscopy to exclude morphological aberrations. A
   transurethral perisphincteric injection of 200 units botulinum toxin
   type A (BTX) was followed by a 2- to 4-week visit to evaluate their
   influence on the neuro-urological symptomatology.
   Results: All chronic prostatic pain patients suffered from a
   pathological pelvic floor tenderness, an inability of sufficient
   conscious pelvic floor control, a urethral hypersensitivity/hyperalgesia
   and a urethral muscle hyperactivity. Basic parameters of bladder
   function (capacity, sensitivity, compliance) were normal. The BTX
   injection was followed by a pelvic floor muscle weakening and a relief
   of prostatic pain and urethral hypersensitivity/hyperalgesia. A
   botulinum-related decrease of the functional urethral length, the
   urethral sphincter closure pressure, the postvoid residual volume and an
   increase of the peak and average uroflow were objectivated.
   Conclusion: A weakening of the urethral sphincter muscle via blocking
   acetylcholine release by BTX injection is followed by pain relief and
   symptom improvement. It can therefore be concluded that a barrage of
   nociceptive information from the dysfunctional pelvic floor overflood
   the CNS and induce a changed CNS processing. Interrupting the efferent
   branch of the disturbed central circle is one opportunity to treat
   chronic prostatic pain. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.}},

Abstract = {{The satellite region on the short arm of chromosome 1B in wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42) carries many agronomically
   important genes; i.e., genes conferring fungal disease resistance, seed
   storage proteins, and fertility restoration. To find molecular markers
   located on the satellite region, we applied the fluorescent AFLP
   (amplified fragment length polymorphism) technique to aneuploids and
   deletion stocks of the cultivar T. aestivum `Chinese Spring'. Out of
   6017 fragments amplified with 80 primer combinations in normal `Chinese
   Spring', 24 were assigned to 1BS. Twelve of them clustered within a
   small region of the satellite known to be rich in RFLP (restriction
   fragment length polymorphism) markers. AFLPs in 1BS and in the whole
   genome were calculated between `Chinese Spring' and T. spelta var.
   duhamelianum. The polymorphism rates in the satellite region (58.3\%)
   and in the 1BS arm (45.8\%) were much higher than the average rate for
   the whole genome (10.7\%). Seven of the 12 AFLP markers in the satellite
   region were revealed to be specific to `Chinese Spring' and could
   potentially be useful for genetic mapping in a segregation population of
   `Chinese Spring' X T. spelta.}},

Abstract = {{A series of poly (phenylenevinylene) (PPV)/ TiO2 nanocomposites were
   prepared from the mixtures of PPV precursor and TiO2 sol by employing a
   sol-gel process. The luminescent properties of the PPV/TiO2
   nanocomposites were dependent on the mass ratio of TiO2 to PPV. When the
   mass ratio of TiO2 to PPV was 1/9, the resultant TiO2 nanoparticle
   quenched the luminescence of PPV. However, when the mass ratio of TiO2
   to PPV was 1/1, the PPV/TiO2 nanocomposites showed enhanced
   luminescence. In this paper, the relationships between the luminescent
   properties and structures of PPV/TiO2 nanocomposites were investigated
   by FT-IR, UV-Vis, FL spectra and TEM.}},

   fresh weight h(-1) and 19.7 ng N2O-N g(-1) fresh weight h(-1),
   respectively, i.e. approximately twice that of the controls. The NO2--N
   concentration in 2,4-D- and in bromoxynil-treated soybean was about 8
   mug N g(-1) fresh weight, i.e. fivefold the concentration found in
   control plants. The NO3- content in herbicide-treated soybean did not
   differ significantly from that of the control plants. Consequently, the
   accumulation of NO2--N during the assimilation of NO3--N was thought to
   cause the observed N2O release. Probably, N2O is a by-product produced

Abstract = {{Toluene dioxygenase (TDO) from Pseudomonas putida F1 converts indene to
   a mixture of cis-indandiol (racemic), 1-indenol, and 1-indanone. The
   desired product, cis-(1S, 2R)-indandiol, is a potential key intermediate
   in the chemical synthesis of indinavir sulfate (Crixivan), Merck's HIV-1
   protease inhibitor :For the treatment of AIDS. To reduce the undesirable
   byproducts 1-indenol and 1-indanone formed during indene bioconversion,
   the recombinant TDO expressed in Escherichia coli was evolved by
   directed evolution using the error-prone polymerase chain reaction
   (epPCR) method. High-throughput fluorometric and spectrophotometric
   assays were developed for rapid screening of the mutant libraries in a
   96-well format. Mutants with reduced 1-indenol by-product formation were
   identified, and the individual indene bioconversion product profiles of
   the selected mutants were confirmed by HPLC. Changes in the amino acid
   sequence of the mutant enzymes were identified by analyzing the
   nucleotide sequence of the genes. A mutant with the most desirable
   product profile from each library, defined as the most reduced 1-indenol
   concentration and with the highest cis-(1S, 2R)-indandiol enantiomeric
   excess, was used to perform each subsequent round of mutagenesis. After
   three rounds of mutagenesis and screening, mutant 1C4-3G was identified
   to have a threefold reduction in 1-indenol formation over the wild type
   (20\% vs 60\% of total products) and a 40\% increase of product
   (cis-indandiol) yield. (C) 2000 Academic Press}},

Abstract = {{SHP-1 is an important negative regulator of signaling by several
   receptors including receptors for interleukin-2 (IL-2R) and other
   cytokines, SHP-1 acts by dephosphorylating the receptors and
   receptor-associated kinases such as IL-2R-associated Jak3 kinase. We
   found that SHP-1 protein was not detectable or greatly diminished in
   most (six of seven) T cell. lines derived from various types of T cell
   lymphomas and all (eight of eight) cutaneous T-cell lymphoma tissues
   with a transformed, large-cell morphology, All T-cell lymphoma lines
   tested (eight of eight) expressed diminished amounts or no detectable
   SHP-1 mRNA. These T cell lines did not, however, carry any mutations in
   the SHP-1 gene-coding, splice-junction, and promoter regions.
   Importantly, SHP-1 DNA promoter region fn the T cell lines was resistant
   to digestion with three different methylation-sensitive restriction
   enzymes. This resistance was reversed by treatment of the cells with a
   demethylating agent, 5-deoxyazacytidine. The treatment resulted also in
   the expression of SHP-1 mRNA and, less frequently, SHP-1 protein. The
   expression of SHP-1 protein was associated with dephosphorylation of the
   Jak3 kinase. These results show that lack of SHP-1 expression is
   frequent in malignant T cells and results from methylation of the SHP-1
   gene promoter. Furthermore, they indicate that SHP-1 loss may play a
   role in the pathogenesis of T cell lymphomas by permitting persistence
   of signals generated by IL-2R and, possibly, other receptor complexes.}},

Abstract = {{The neutron diffusion equation is usually solved in a symmetric region.
   For a non-rectangular symmetric region, the nonphysical singular problem
   arises when the conventional method of deriving nodal solution is
   employed. In this paper,a new method based on both symmetries of the
   problem and an analytic representation of the nodal flux distribution is
   presented. The method is effective for the solution of multigroup
   diffusion equation in the symmetric region,especially for the
   non-rectangular problem. It can be applied in 2-D or 3-D problems and
   its application in hexagonal geometry is introduced as an example. The
   only approximations used in deriving the method are the treatment of
   unknown functions. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated
   by results of various 2-D and 3-D benchmark problems using the GTDIF-H

Title = {{Hydrous species geospeedometer in rhyolite: Improved calibration and
   application}},

Abstract = {{The hydrous species geospeedometer is based on the homogeneous
   interconversion reaction between molecular H2O species and OH species in
   silicate melts and glasses. Here we report new data for the calibration
   of the geospeedometer in rhyolitic glass, extending the coverage of
   quench rate to 94 Ws and of H2Ot to 7.7 wt.\% by using a piston-cylinder
   apparatus at low pressures (200-500 MPa) to prevent bubble growth and to
   generate high and monitored quench rates. The new experimental data at
   pressure are highly reproducible and consistent with earlier data at 0.1
   MPa, indicating negligible pressure effect on the relation between
   speciation and quench rate at P less than or equal to 500 MPa. In order
   to avoid calibration uncertainties, the original infrared data are used
   to represent species concentrations and the equilibrium constant. (A)
   over bar(523) and (A) over bar(452) (absorbances of the 523 and 452
   mm(-1) bands in terms of peak height per mm sample thickness) are used
   to represent concentrations of molecular H2O and OH groups,
   respectively, and Q' (= (A) over bar(452)(2)/(A) over bar(523)) is used
   to represent the quotient of the species interconversion reaction, since
   there is rough proportionality between the corresponding parameters ((A)
   over bar(523) and molecular H2O, (A) over bar(452) and OH, Q' and the
   quotient Q). Zhang et al. {[}Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 61, 3089-3100
   (1997a)] showed that for a given quench rate (q), there is an excellent
   linear relation between In Q' and 1n((A) over bar(523) + (A) over
   bar(452)) when total H2O is less than or equal to 3.0\%. With new data
   at higher total H2O, the linear relation does not hold anymore.
   Furthermore, the new data show that the linear relation between 1n Q'
   and 1n q does not hold at high q. Hence, the geospeedometry model of
   Zhang et al. can be used for interpolation, but extrapolation may lead
   to large errors. A new geospeedometry model using the combined data set
   is presented in this work and applied to natural rhyolitic glasses. The
   new geospeedometer can be used to quantify cooling rates in a quench
   medium or an experimental apparatus. Furthermore, it can be used to
   determine the cooling rates of individual pyroclasts, different parts of
   a lava flow, and melt inclusions in phenocrysts, thus allowing inference
   of rich details of volcanic processes. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Bayesian tomographic reconstruction algorithms generally require the
   efficient optimization of a functional of many variables, In this
   setting, as well as in many other optimization tasks, functional
   substitution (FS) has been widely applied to simplify each step of the
   iterative process. The function to be minimized is replaced locally by
   an approximation having a more easily manipulated form, e.g., quadratic,
   but which maintains sufficient similarity to descend the true functional
   while computing only the substitute. In this paper, we provide two new
   applications of FS methods in iterative coordinate descent for Bayesian
   tomography, The first is a modification of our coordinate descent
   algorithm with one-dimensional (1-D) Newton-Raphson approximations to an
   alternative quadratic which allows convergence to be proven easily. In
   simulations, we fmd essentially no difference in convergence speed
   between the two techniques. We also present a new algorithm which
   exploits the FS method to allow parallel updates of arbitrary sets of
   pixels using computations similar to iterative coordinate descent. The
   theoretical potential speed up of parallel implementations is nearly
   linear with the number of processors if communication costs are
   neglected.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we used comparative genomic hybridization to provide an
   overview of chromosomal imbalances in a series of 20 adult and 8
   childhood ependymomas. All tumors displayed multiple genomic imbalances.
   Loss of genetic material was observed in chromosomes 22q (71\%), 16
   (57\%), 17 (46\%), 6 (39\%), 19q (32\%), 20q (32\%), and 1p (29\%), with
   the overlapped deletion regions determined at 16p13.1-13.3, 16q22-q24,
   19q13.1-13.4, 20q13.1-13.2 and 1p36.1-36.3. Gain of DNA was commonly
   detected on chromosomes 5q (46\%), 12q (39\%), 7q (36\%), 9q (36\%), and
   4q (32\%), with overlapped regions of gain mapped to 5q21-22,

   findings suggest a greater degree of genomic imbalance in ependymomas
   than has been recognized previously and highlight chromosomal loci
   likely to contain oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that may
   contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of this tumor. Our study also
   confirmed previous findings on frequent losses of 17 and 22q in

   proposed. Indeed, this model has been applied for the block and the
   mortar. While confronting the experimental results with those of the
   model, the model proves to be satisfactory. The residue of approximation
   is tinder 10\%. The model is intermediate between the two limit models
   proposed for the heterogeneous materials, namely Voigt's and Reuss'.
   The determination by the model of the damage ratio gives information on
   the evolution of the damage within the walls according to the applied
   loading.}},

Abstract = {{The present study of structural and physiological changes during the
   development of the cushion moss, Grimmia pulvinata, quantifies the
   size-dependence of various parameters of water relations such as changes
   in surface:volume ratio (S/V) or water loss rates, and also measures net
   CO(2) gas exchange in the light and the dark. Larger cushions had lower
   S/V values than smaller ones and featured lower rates of area-based
   evapotranspiration, owing to higher boundary-layer resistance, but did
   not differ in relative water storage capacity (expressed as a percentage
   of d. wt). In combination, this leads to considerably longer hydration
   periods in larger cushions. By contrast, CO(2) gas-exchange parameters
   were negatively correlated with size: larger cushions showed
   significantly lower (mass-based) rates of net photosynthesis and dark
   respiration. Using these data, we estimated carbon budgets during a
   drying cycle as a function of cushion size. When including alternations
   of dark and light periods, the relationship proved to be rather
   complicated. Depending on the time of hydration, net carbon budgets not
   only varied quantitatively with size but sometimes took on both positive
   and negative values depending on cushion size. We conclude that
   neglecting plant size can lead to unrepeatable or even misleading
   results in comparative ecophysiological studies, and therefore urge for
   adequate attention to be paid to size in these studies.}},

   sleepy lizard (Tiliqua rugosa)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Sleepy lizards Tiliqua rugosa are large, long-lived, Australian skinks
   that live in stable home ranges. Previous studies showed that the
   lizards have a good sense of orientation and navigation towards home.
   However, since they are active only 4 months in every year, there is a
   question about which environmental cues enable them to locate their home
   boundaries. In the present study we determined whether surrounding
   olfactory and chemical cues are important for the sleepy lizards for
   home-range maintenance. In the first part of the study we showed in the
   laboratory that zinc sulphate (ZnSO4) is a chemical that induces anosmia
   and prevents detection of chemical cues in sleepy lizards for up to 30
   days, with no evident longterm harm to the animals. We then monitored
   the location of 50 radio-tagged sleepy lizards. After determining their
   home ranges they were divided into three groups: an untreated control, a
   saline-treated (sham-operated) group and a ZnSO4-treated group. Starting
   2 days after the treatment, the home ranges of all lizards were
   re-determined within the period that ZnSO4 blocked olfaction. Three
   variables were calculated comparing home ranges before and after
   treatments: the change in home-range size, the distance between the
   centre of activities of the lizards, and the overlap between the
   individual home ranges before and after treatments. Lizard home ranges
   varied from 1.9 +/- 0.6 ha to 4.6 +/- 1.4 ha before treatment, and 1.3
   +/- 0.3 ha to 3.1 +/- 0.7 ha after treatment. There was no significant
   effect of treatments or of sex on the home-range size or on the
   distances between the centre of activities, or on the overlap between
   the individual home ranges. Our data indicate that olfaction and
   vomerolfaction are not a major cue for home-range maintenance in the
   sleepy lizards.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of open-cell nickel foams are investigated for
   the range of densities used in industrial applications for energy
   storage. The obtained Young's modulus, compression yield stress and
   tensile fracture stress are compared to the predictions of models based
   on periodic, Penrose and Voronoi beam networks. It is found that Gibson
   and Ashby's model {[}L.J. Gibson, M.F. Ashby, Cellular Solids, Cambridge
   University Press, Cambridge, 1998] provides the proper scaling laws with
   respect to relative density for almost all investigated properties. The
   strong anisotropy of the observed overall responses can also be
   accounted for. The two-dimensional strain field during the tension of a
   nickel foam strip has been measured using a photomechanical technique.
   Non-homogeneous deformation patterns are shown to arise. The same
   technique is used to obtain the strain field around a circular hole in a
   nickel foam strip. The observed deformation fields are compared to the
   results of a finite element analysis using anisotropic compressible
   continuum plasticity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights

Abstract = {{Transparent ZnO films were prepared by rf magnetron sputtering, and
   their electrical, optical, and structural properties were investigated
   under various sputtering conditions. Aluminum-doped n-type(n-ZnO) and
   undoped intrinsic-ZnO (i-ZnO) layers were deposited on a glass substrate
   by incorporating different targets in the same reaction chamber. The
   n-ZnO films were strongly affected by argon ambient pressure and
   substrate temperature, and films deposited at 2 mTorr and 100 degrees C
   showed superior properties in resistivity, transmission, and figure of
   merit (FOM). The sheet resistance of ZnO film was less dependent on film
   thickness when the substrate was heated during deposition. These
   positive effects of elevated substrate temperature are presumably
   attributed to the rearrangement of the sputtered atoms by the heat
   energy. Also, the films are electrically uniform through the 5 cm x 5 cm
   substrate. The maximum deviation in sheet resistance is less than 10\%.
   All of the films showed strong (0 0 2) diffraction peak near 28 = 34
   degrees. The undoped i-ZnO films deposited in the mixture of argon and
   oxygen gases showed high transmission properties in the visible range,
   independent of the Ar/O-2 ratio, while resistivity rose with increased
   oxygen partial pressure. The Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 solar cells, incorporating
   bi-layer ZnO films (n-ZnO/i-ZnO) as window layer, were finally
   fabricated. The fabricated solar cells showed 14.48\% solar efficiency
   under AM 1.5 conditions (100 mW/cm(2)). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{We have developed a method to convert membrane-bound replication
   complexes isolated from Nicotiana benthamiana plants infected with
   potato virus X (PVX) to a soluble, template-dependent system for
   analysis of RNA synthesis. Analysis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
   activity in the membrane-bound, endogenous template extracts indicated
   three major products, which corresponded to double-stranded versions of
   PVX genomic RNA and the two predominant subgenomic RNAs. The endogenous
   templates were removed from the membrane-bound complex by treatment with
   BAL 31 nuclease in the presence of Nonidet P-40 (NP-40). Upon the
   addition of full-length plus- or minus- strand PVX transcripts, the
   corresponding-size products were detected. Synthesis was not observed
   when red clover necrotic mosaic dianthovirus (RCNMV) RNA 2 templates
   were added, indicating template specificity for PVX transcripts.
   Plus-strand PVX templates lacking the 3' terminal region were not
   copied, suggesting that elements in the 3' region were required for
   initiation of RNA synthesis. Extracts that supported RNA synthesis from
   endogenous templates could also be solublized using sodium
   taurodeoxycholate and then rendered template-dependent by BAL 31
   nuclease/NP-40 treatment. The solubilized preparations copied both
   plus-and minus-strand PVX transcripts, but did not supper? synthesis
   from RCNMV RNA 2. These membrane-bound and soluble template-dependent
   systems will facilitate analyses of viral and host components required
   for PVX RNA synthesis. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The instability of nonviral vectors in aqueous suspensions has
   stimulated an interest in developing lyophilized formulations for use in
   gene therapy. previous work has demonstrated a strong correlation
   between the maintenance of particle size and retention of transfection
   rates. Our earlier work has shown that aggregation of nonviral vectors
   typically occurs during the freezing step of the lyophilization process,
   and that high concentrations of sugars are capable of maintaining
   particle size. This study extends these observations, and demonstrates
   that glass formation is not the mechanism by which sugars protect
   lipid/DNA complexes during freezing. We also show that polymers (e.g,,
   hydroxyethyl starch) are not capable of preventing aggregation despite
   their ability to form glasses at relatively high subzero temperatures.
   Instead, our data suggest that it is the separation of individual
   particles within the unfrozen fraction that prevents aggregation during
   freezing, i.e., the particle isolation hypothesis. Furthermore, we
   suggest that the relatively low surface tension of mono- and
   disaccharides, as compared to starch, allows phase-separated particles
   to remain dispersed within the unfrozen excipient solution, which
   preserves particle size and transfection rates during freezing. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Prolonged serum deprivation induces a structurally and functionally
   contractile phenotype in about 1/6 of cultured airway myocytes, which
   exhibit morphological elongation and accumulate abundant contractile
   apparatus-associated proteins. We tested the hypothesis that
   transcriptional activation of genes encoding these proteins accounts for
   their accumulation during this phenotypic transition by measuring the
   transcriptional activities of the murine SM22 and human smooth muscle
   myosin heavy chain promoters during transient transfection in
   subconfluent, serum fed or 7 day serum-deprived cultured canine tracheal
   smooth muscle cells. Contrary to our expectation, SM22 and smooth muscle
   myosin heavy chain promoter activities (but not viral murine sarcoma
   virus-long terminal repeat promoter activity) were decreased in long
   term serum-deprived myocytes by at least 8-fold. Because serum response
   factor (SRF) is a required transcriptional activator of these and other
   smooth muscle-specific promoters, we evaluated the expression and
   function of SRF in subconfluent and long term serum-deprived cells.
   Whole cell SRP mRNA and protein were maintained at high levels in
   serum-deprived myocytes, but SRF transcription-promoting activity,
   nuclear SRF binding to consensus CArG sequences, and nuclear SRF protein
   were reduced. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry revealed extranuclear
   redistribution of SRF in serum-deprived myocytes; nuclear localization
   of SRF was restored after serum refeeding. These results uncover a novel
   mechanism for physiological control of smooth muscle-specific gene
   expression through extranuclear redistribution of SRF and consequent
   down-regulation of its transcription-promoting activity.}},

Abstract = {{Fenofibrate and fasting are known to regulate several genes involved in
   lipid metabolism in a similar way. In this study measuring several
   mitochondrial enzyme activities, we demonstrate that, in contrast to
   citrate synthase and complex II, cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is a
   specific target of these two treatments. In mouse liver organelles,
   Western blot experiments indicated that mitochondrial levels of p43, a
   mitochondrial T3 receptor, and mitochondrial peroxisome proliferator
   activated receptor (mt-PPAR), previously described as a dimeric partner
   of p43 in the organelle, are increased by both fenofibrate and fasting,
   In addition, in PPAR alpha-deficient mice, this influence was abolished
   for mt-PPAR but not for p43, whereas the increase in COX: activity was
   not altered. These data indicate that: (1) PPAR alpha is involved in

Abstract = {{An analytical method based on membrane introduction and fast gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been developed for the
   on-line monitoring of trihalomethanes (THMs) in chlorinated drinking
   water. The coupling of membrane introduction with fast CC-MS offers the
   advantage of membrane introduction as an on-line sampling device and
   fast CC-MS as a separation and identification method. While maintaining
   the on-line monitoring characteristic of traditional membrane
   introduction mass spectrometry (MIMS), the difficulty of distinguishing
   CHCl3 and CHBrCl2 in MIMS was overcome by rapid GC separation and MS
   analysis. Water permeated across the membrane affected the analysis of
   CHBr2Cl and CHBr3. A method based on controlling the injection
   temperature and injection time has been developed to overcome the
   moisture problem. This method is simple and less time consuming than the
   conventional moisture removing method. Under typical operating
   conditions, the sampling rate was about 20 samples h(-1) capable of
   on-line monitoring THMs in chlorinated drinking water. The detection
   limits of this system were found to be about 2 ppt, 4 ppt, 4 ppt, and 8
   ppt for CHCl3, CHBrCl2, CHBr2Cl, and CHBr3, respectively. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Background: HIV infection in Africa is associated with immune activation
   and a cytokine profile that stimulates CCR5 expression. We investigated
   whether this immune activation is environmentally driven; if a dominant
   expression of CCR5 could indeed be detected in African individuals; and
   if R5 HIV strains would be prevalent in this population.
   Methods: Freshly drawn peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
   HIV-uninfected African and Italian individuals living in rural Africa,
   from HIV-uninfected Africans and Italians living in Italy, and from
   HIV-infected African and Italian patients were analysed. Determinations
   of HIV coreceptor-specific mRNAs and immunophenotype analyses were
   performed in all samples. Virological analyses included virus isolation
   and characterization of plasma neutralizing activity.
   Findings: Results showed that: immune activation is detected both in
   Italian and African HIV-uninfected individuals living in Africa but not
   in African subjects living in Italy; CCR5-specific mRNA is augmented and
   the surface expression of CCR5 is increased in African compared with
   Italian residents (CXCR4-specific mRNA is comparable); R5-HIV strains
   are isolated prevalently from lymphocytes of African HIV-infected
   patients; and plasma neutralizing activity in HIV-infected African
   patients is mostly specific for R5 strains.
   Conclusions: Immune activation in African residents is environmentally
   driven and not genetically predetermined. This immune activation results
   in a skewing of the CCR5 : CXCR4 ratio which is associated with a
   prevalent isolation of R5 viruses. These data suggest that the selection
   of the predominant virus strain within the population could be
   influenced by an immunologically driven pattern of HIV co receptor
   expression. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To analyse the virological and clinical efficacy of
   cidofovir combined with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in
   AIDS-related progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).
   Design: Multicentre observational study of consecutive HIV-positive
   patients with histologically or virologically-proven PML. Group A, 26
   patients treated with HAART; group B, 14 patients treated with HAART
   plus cidofovir 5 mg/kg intravenously per week for the first 2 weeks and
   alternate weeks thereafter. JC virus DNA was quantified in cerebrospinal
   fluid (CSF) by PCR.
   Results: Baseline virological, immunological and clinical
   characteristics were homogeneous between the groups. In one case
   cidofovir was discontinued because of severe proteinuria. There was no
   significant difference in HIV RNA responses and changes in the number of
   CD4 cells between group A and B. After 2 months of therapy, five out of
   12 (42\%) patients from group A and seven out of eight (87\%) from group
   B reached undetectable JC virus DNA in the CSF (Chi-square P = 0.04);
   moreover, 24\% of group A and 57\% of group B patients showed
   neurological improvement or stability (P = 0.038). One-year cumulative
   probability of survival was 0.67 with cidofovir and 0.31 without
   (log-rank test, P = 0.01). Variables independently associated with
   longer survival were the use of cidofovir, HAART prior to the onset of
   PML, a baseline JC virus DNA load in CSF < 4.7 log(10) copies/ml, and a
   baseline Karnofsky performance status <greater than or equal to> 60.
   Conclusions: In AIDS-related PML, cidofovir added to HAART is associated
   with a more effective control of ICV replication, with improved
   neurological outcome and survival compared with HAART alone. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Background and objective: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) may develop into
   a serious disease leading to invalidism in a considerable proportion of
   patients. Detailed clinical and epidemiological data about the risks of
   TEE in Baden-Wurttemberg have been missing. A prospective study was
   started in 1994 to investigate the areas of risk in this part of Germany
   and to describe the clinical course and prognosis of TBE.
   Patients and methods: Doctors at all departments of Internal Medicine,
   Neurology and Paediatrics, at diagnostic laboratories and the
   departments of public health were asked to participate in this study.
   Data were recorded by means of a questionnaire.
   Results: Between 1994 and 1999, 771 patients with TEE were recorded.
   Detailed clinical and epidemiological data were available for 731
   patients. In 88\% of the patients infection took place during leisure
   time activity, two thirds of infections occurring between June and
   August. The median incubation period was 8 days with a range of 4-28
   days. 71\% of the patients reported a prodromal stage with flu-like
   symptoms. TEE manifested as isolated meningitis in 47\%, as
   meningoencephalitis in 42\% and as meningoencephalomyelitis in 11\%.
   With increasing age the number with a serious course of disease also
   increased. The most frequent symptoms were impairment of consciousness,
   ataxia and pareses of the limbs. In the children, the course of disease
   and prognosis was much better than in adults. Of 230 patients who were
   re-examined between 1 and 5 years after the acute illness 23\% suffered
   from persisting moderate or severe symptoms. The death rate was about
   1.4\%.
   Conclusion: In Baden-Wurttemberg, tick bites are associated with a high
   risk of tick-borne encephalitis and severe neurological complications.
   Therefore, active immunization is recommended for all persons exposing
   themselves to ticks. Persisting complications after TEE are by far more
   common than serious complications after active immunization.}},

Abstract = {{Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein was studied
   in the brain after intracerebroventricular injections of interferon
   (IFN)-gamma, and IFN-gamma combined with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or
   tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, compared to ovalbumin as control.
   Wild-type mice and mice with targeted deletion of the IFN-gamma receptor
   gene were used. Findings based on iNOS immunoreactivity were evaluated
   at 1, 2, 4 and 7 days post-injection, using also quantitative image
   analysis and double labeling with glial cell markers. IFN-gamma
   administration induced iNOS immmunostaining in activated microglia and
   macrophages in the parenchyma surrounding the ventricular system,
   several cortical fields and fiber tracts. IFN-gamma-elicited iNOS
   immunoreactivity was down-regulated after 1 day. The number of
   iNOS-immunopositive cells was significantly enhanced by
   co-administration of LPS or TNF-alpha; IFN-gamma+TNF-alpha injections
   also resulted in longer persistence of iNOS immunoreactivity. No
   immunopositive cells were seen in the brain of IFN-gamma receptor
   knockout mice after IFN-gamma administration; very few immunostained
   macrophages were detected in these cases, mostly around the injection
   needle track, after co-administration of LPS or TNF-alpha. Western blot
   analysis confirmed a marked iNOS induction in the brain of wild-type
   mice 24 h after IFN-gamma+LPS injections. The findings show that
   inflammatory mediators circulating in the cerebrospinal fluid induce in
   vivo iNOS in the brain with topographical selectivity and temporal
   regulation. The data also demonstrate that the signaling cascade
   activated by IFN-gamma binding to its receptor is critical for iNOS
   induction, and the synergistic action of LPS and TNF-alpha as iNOS
   inducers in brain cells is largely mediated by the receptor-regulated
   action of IFN-gamma. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In marsupials and in extraembryonic tissues of placental mammals, X
   inactivation is imprinted to occur on the paternal chromosome. Here, we
   find that imprinting is controlled by the antisense Xist gene, Tsix.
   Tsix is maternally expressed and mice carrying a Tsix deletion show
   normal paternal but impaired maternal transmission. Maternal inheritance
   occurs infrequently, with surviving progeny showing intrauterine growth
   retardation and reduced fertility. Transmission ratio distortion results
   from disrupted imprinting and postimplantation loss of mutant embryos.
   In contrast to effects in embryonic stem cells, deleting Tsix causes
   ectopic X inactivation in early male embryos and inactivation of both X
   chromosomes in female embryos, indicating that X chromosome counting
   cannot override Tsix imprinting. These results highlight differences
   between imprinted and random X inactivation but show that Tsix regulates
   both. We propose that an imprinting center lies within Tsix.}},

Abstract = {{The outer membrane subunit OprM of the multicomponent efflux pump of
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been assumed to form a transmembrane
   xenobiotic exit channel across the outer membrane. We challenged this
   hypothesis to clarify the underlying ambiguity by manipulating the
   amino-terminal signal sequence of the OprM protein of the MexAB-OprM
   efflux pump in P. aeruginosa, {[}H-3]Palmitate uptake experiments
   revealed that OprM is a lipoprotein. The following lines of evidence
   unequivocally established that the OprM protein functioned at the
   periplasmic space. (i) The OprM protein, in which a signal sequence
   including Cys-18 was replaced with that of periplasmic azurin, appeared
   in the periplasmic space but not in the outer membrane fraction, and the
   protein fully functioned as the pump subunit. (ii) The hybrid OprM
   containing the N-terminal transmembrane segment of the inner membrane
   protein, MexF, appeared exclusively in the inner membrane fraction. The
   hybrid protein containing 186 or 331 amino acid residues of MexF was
   fully active for the antibiotic extrusion, but a 42-residue protein was
   totally inactive. (iii) The mutant OprM, in which the N-terminal
   cysteine residue was replaced with another amino acid, appeared
   unmodified with fatty acid and was fractionated in both the periplasmic
   space and the inner membrane fraction but not in the outer membrane
   fraction. The Cys-18-modified OprM functioned for the antibiotic
   extrusion indistinguishably from that in the wild-type strain. We
   concluded, based on these results, that the OprM protein was anchored in
   the outer membrane via fatty acid(s) attached to the N-terminal cysteine
   residue and that the entire polypeptide moiety was exposed to the
   periplasmic space.}},

Abstract = {{The cure index and apparent activation energy of vulcanization of one
   grade of natural rubber (SMR L) and two grades of epoxidized natural
   rubbers (ENR 25 and ENR 50) were studied in the presence of three types
   of antioxidants {[}viz., 2,2' metllylene-bis(4-methyl-6-tertbutylphenol)
   (AO 2246), poly;2,2,4-trimelhyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline (TMQ), and
   N-isopropyl-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (IPPD)] in the temperature
   range of 120-180 degrees C. by using a Monsanto automatic Mooney
   viscometer. Accelerated sulfur vulcanization system and up to 5 phr of
   antioxidant concentration was used throughout the investigation. Results
   indicate that both cure index and apparent activation energy of
   vulcanization are dependent on the type and concentration of the
   antioxidant used. AO 2246 (a phenol-based antioxidant) would retard
   vulcanization as reflected by the higher cure index and activation
   energy, an observation which is attributed to the solvation and steric
   hindrance effects of the antioxidant. On the contrary, both TMQ and IPPD
   (amine-based antioxidants) exhibit reverse behavior due to the catalytic
   effect of the antioxidants in generating more active sulfurating agents
   for vulcanization. In all cases, SMR L gives higher cure index and
   apparent activation energy than the corresponding ENR, a phenomenon
   which is associated with the activation of the adjacent double bond by
   epoxide group in the latter. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{To succeed in scramble competition for food an individual fish will have
   to have characteristics that allow it to respond rapidly to encountered
   prey. A trait such as metabolic rate, which has a positive effect on
   oxygen consumption and growth rate, is likely to be positively
   correlated with the traits that determine the speed of reaction. An
   important factor underlying metabolic rare may be the transport
   efficiency of oxygen from the gills to the: respiring tissue and this is
   mediated by the structure of the haemoglobin molecule. In cod, two
   structures of this molecule exist due to polymorphism at the HbI{*}
   locus. An individual cod may be homozygous (HbI{*}1/1 or HbI{*}2/2) or
   heterozygous (HbI{*}1/2). Evidence exists in the literature that
   HbI{*}2/2 fish have higher growth rate and earlier maturation and higher
   transport efficiency of oxygen at low temperature. However, no study has
   examined whether this could be associated with fish behaviour. In a
   study reported here we designed an experiment to test the hypothesis
   that fish with the HbI{*}2/2 genotype have a higher motivation to feed
   and are better competitors than individuals with the other haemoglobin
   genotypes and that they will eat a larger share of the prey. We use prey
   capture success early in a feeding trial and the rank of the first prey
   taken, as proxy variables for competitive performance. Randomly chosen
   one-year-old cod Gadus morhua L. in small groups were tested
   experimentally for individual responses to prey offered sequentially. We
   analysed the effect on competitive performance of haemoglobin genotype,
   group, fish size, sex, maturation status and unobserved effects using
   Components of Variance Analysis, which accounts for repeated
   observations from the same individuals. The most successful fish were
   usually among the first to feed and tended to possess haemoglobin
   genotype HbI{*}2/2. Other factors such as body size, sex, stage of
   maturation and group also had effects which may modify the effect set by
   genotype. Our results suggest that the link between HbI{*} genotype and
   growth is through feeding behaviour and it supports the idea that fish
   with HbI{*}2/2 genotype are better able to support an active metabolism.
   The results obtained are among the first on fish that show that
   variation in feeding behaviour could be under genetic control.}},

Abstract = {{We have reported that a deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH,), an
   active cofactor of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), contributes to the
   endothelial dysfunction through reduced eNOS activity and increased
   superoxide anion (O-2(-)) generation in the insulin-resistant state. To
   further confirm this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of dietary
   treatment with BH4 on endothelium-dependent arterial relaxation and
   vascular oxidative stress in the aortas of insulin-resistant rats. Oral
   supplementation of BH4 (10 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) for 8 weeks significantly
   increased the BH4 content in cardiovascular tissues of rats fed high
   levels of fructose (fructose-fed rats). Impairment of
   endothelium-dependent arterial relaxation in the aortic strips of the
   fructose-fed rats was reversed with BH4 treatment. The BH4 treatment was
   associated with a 2-fold increase in eNOS activity as well as a 70\%
   reduction in endothelial O-2(-) production compared with those in
   fructose-fed rats. The BH4 treatment also partially improved the insulin
   sensitivity and blood pressure, as well as the serum triglyceride
   concentration, in the fructose-fed rats. Moreover, BH4 treatment of the
   fructose-fed rats markedly reduced the Lipid peroxide content of both
   aortic and cardiac tissues and inhibited the activation of 2
   redox-sensitive transcription factors, nuclear factor-kappa B and
   activating protein-1, which were increased in fructose-fed rats. The BH4
   treatment of control rats did not have any significant effects on these
   parameters. These results indicate that BH4 augmentation is essential
   for the restoration of eNOS function and the reduction of vascular
   oxidative stress in insulin-resistant rats.}},

   coefficients for the upper and lower rolls, whilst Model II considers
   different frictional coefficients for the upper and lower rolls. The
   relationships between the ratio of effective radius to initial thickness
   and bite angle for the two models are proposed. The comparisons of front
   tension, rolling force per unit width, reduction, and limiting roll
   speed ratio for the two models are examined. From an analytical
   approach, the values of minimum thickness can be obtained. The study
   proposes a new analytical technique to explore the minimum thickness.

   transition temperature decreases to disappear almost completely.
   Meanwhile the associated E(T) minimum at the beginning (n < 250) deepens
   and then becomes progressively shallower and wider (3 x 10(3) less than
   or equal to n < 18 x 10(3)). The strong sensitivity of P-AM (P-MA) to
   thermal cycling and to impurity (hydrogen) contents suggests that this
   peak is predominantly associated with stress-assisted corrective motions
   of twin boundaries located inside the martensite platelets embedded
   within the austenite phase, rather than with the martensitic transition
   itself. However, as the high temperature tail of P-AM starts at
   temperatures appreciably higher than the martensite start-temperature
   M-s, a premartensitic contribution to damping is also present. The
   widening of the E(T) minimum indicates that, for n greater than or equal
   to 3 x 103, the direct transformation is to some extent hindered by the
   dislocation network introduced by thermal cycling. A not thermally
   activated IF peak P-TWM, which is believed to be due to stress-assisted
   motions of (001) compound twin boundaries in the homogeneous martensite
   state, grows with increasing rr. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All

Abstract = {{In this paper we report an ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS)
   study of saturated alkane chains in various configurations and
   conformations. The dependence of the valence spectra on molecular
   structure characteristics has been assessed by comparing the results
   obtained from n-alkanethiol, alpha,omega-alkanedithiol, and
   alpha-cycloalkyl-omega-alkanethiol monolayers adsorbed on gold, and from
   gas-phase model alkane compounds. The differences between the spectra
   reflect directly the structural changes induced in the electronic
   structure of the alkane chains. We have determined the type of folding
   sequences adopted in a 1,12-dodecanedithiol monolayer. Angular dependent
   measurements and investigations on the photoelectron attenuation length
   have evidenced very fine structural differences between films obtained
   on deposited gold films, annealed gold films, and gold single crystals.}},

Abstract = {{A hydroxide-bridged dinuclear nickel complex with a urea molecule
   linking the two metal ions through its carbonyl oxygen atom has been
   prepared as a model for the metalloenzyme urease. This complex,
   {[}Ni-2(mu-OH)(mu-urea)(bdptz)(urea) (CH3CN)](ClO4)(3), where bdptz is
   the dinucleating ligand 1,4-bis(2,2'-dipyridylmethyl)phthalazine,
   effects the hydrolysis of urea upon heating in a two-step reaction. In
   the first step, a molecule of ammonia is eliminated from urea with
   concomitant production of cyanate, the first-order rate constant in
   acetonitrile being (7.7 +/- 0.5) x 10(-4) h(-1). This reaction is at
   least 500 times faster than the spontaneous decomposition of urea under
   the same conditions. When the cyanate-containing product is further
   heated in the presence of water, the cyanate is hydrolyzed with a
   second-order rate constant of (9.5 +/- 1) x 10(-4) M-1 h(-1). Reaction
   of {[}Ni-2(mu-OH)(mu-urea)(bdptz)(urea)(CH3CN)](ClO4)(3) in 50\% aqueous
   acetonitrile afforded ammonia with no appreciable buildup of the
   cyanate-containing species. A possible analogue of the
   cyanate-containing product,
   {[}Ni-2(mu-OH)(mu-H2O)(bdptz)(mu-OCN)](2)(OTs)(4) was independently
   synthesized and structurally characterized. These results establish the
   precedence for hydrolysis of urea via a cyanate intermediate as an
   alternative mechanism for the urease-catalyzed hydrolysis of urea.}},

Abstract = {{The stereoselective total synthesis of the sesquiterpene herbertenediol
   (3) and of its naturally occurring dimers, mastigophorenes A {[}(P)-1]
   and B {[}(M)-1], is. described. Following the ``lactone concept{''},:the
   configuration at the biaryl axis was atropo-divergently induced to be P
   or, optionally, M, by stereocontrolled reductive ring cleavage
   (diastereomeric ratio up to 97:3) of the configurationally unstable
   joint biaryl lactone precursor 17 using the oxazaborolidine-borane
   system, through dynamic kinetic resolution. Mechanistic considerations
   of the lactone coupling suggested interference by a methoxy group next
   to the halogen substituent and led to an improvement of the coupling
   yield from 39 to 87\% (to give the lactone 37). As a new, likewise
   highly efficient variant of the lactone method, we report for the first
   time, the-now nondynamic-kinetic resolution of a structurally related,
   but centrochiral ``aliphatic-aromatic{''} lactone, (rac)-10. Its highly
   efficient (k(rel) > 300) enantiomer-differentiating Corey-Bakshi-Shibata
   reduction delivers the centrochiral building block (R,R)-10 in good
   chemical yield and with excellent stereochemical purity (enantiomeric
   excess > 99.9\%; enrichment of the starting matrial). The ew synthesis
   of natural herbertenediol (3) confirms its absolute stereostructure as
   well as that of its dimers, (P)-1 and (M)-1.}},

Abstract = {{Four hundred and twenty-two nights of middle atmospheric temperature
   observations were obtained in the High Arctic at Eureka (80 degrees N,
   86 degrees W) during six wintertime measurement campaigns from 1992-1993
   to 1997-1998 by using a lidar and meteorological balloons. The
   measurements reveal that temperature changes of greater than 30 K occur
   in the stratosphere within the space of a few weeks. In a comparison
   with maps of wind in the Northern Hemisphere, it is clear that much of
   the thermal variability is associated with movements of the wintertime
   stratospheric vortex over the measurement site. Measurements in the
   vortex core show a persistently cold lower stratosphere and warm upper
   stratosphere. Conversely, outside of the vortex altogether the lower
   stratosphere is relatively warm and the upper stratosphere is cold. By
   separately examining measurements obtained inside the vortex core, a
   25+/-2 K annual warming of the upper stratosphere in late December is
   apparent. This annual vortex core warming is distinctly different from
   planetary-wave-driven sudden stratospheric warming and the seasonal
   march of temperatures due to changing insolation.}},

Abstract = {{Background Chronic rejection is the major obstacle to long-term survival
   of allografts and is associated with graft endothelial cell activation
   and apoptosis. Recent reports have found an association between graft
   survival, presence of Th2 cytokines, and expression by endothelial cells
   of cytoplasmic ``protective{''} molecules that prevent apoptosis and
   down-regulate the inflammatory process.
   Methods. Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were
   used. Apoptotic cells were detected by staining with FITC-annexinV
   followed by flow cytometry. Expression of vascular cell adhesion
   molecule-1, E-selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule-l were also
   measured by flow cytometry. Transcripts were detected by reverse
   transcription-PCR and quantitation was achieved by co-amplification of
   competing, internal standard RNA.
   Results. We demonstrate that exposure of HUVEC to interleukin (IL)-13
   for 72 hr afforded partial protection from apoptosis induced by tumor
   necrosis factor-alpha/cycloheximide or serum starvation. Pretreatment
   with IL-13 also modulated induction of E-selectin after acute exposure
   to tumor necrosis factor-alpha or IL-1 alpha. Protection was associated
   with transcription of the genes Al and A20. Prolonged treatment with
   IL-13 had minimal proinflammatory effects and did not induce expression
   of E-selectin or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 or increase
   intercellular adhesion molecule-1 above basal levels.
   Conclusions. Our data provide a possible explanation for the observed
   association between Th2 cytokines and expression of protective genes in
   the endo thelium of long-surviving allografts and xenografts.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Because epithelial cells are targets of alloimmune injury
   leading ultimately to airway obliteration, we tested whether epithelial
   re-growth could prevent obliterative airway disease (OAD) in orthotopic
   tracheal allografts.
   Methods. Brown Norway tracheal segments were orthotopically transplanted
   into nonimmunosuppressed Lewis rats, Allografts were removed on days
   2-10 (n=13), 30 (n=4), and 60 (n=5) for histology, computerized
   morphometry (obliteration), and immunohistochemical detection of
   mononuclear cells, smooth muscle alpha-actin, and tissue phenotype,
   Normal tracheas, host tracheas, and heterotopically transplanted
   allografts served as controls,
   Results. Orthotopic allografts removed on days 21-10 exhibited
   epithelial damage and re-growth and mononuclear cell infiltration. On
   days 30 and 60, partially ciliated cuboidal or attenuated epithelium
   completely covered the lumen. Although mononuclear cells declined,
   numerous T cells with a high CD4/CD8 ratio were found in the epithelium
   till day 60, Orthotopic allograft epithelium expressed donor phenotype
   on day 7, but recipient phenotype on days 30 and 60, Despite
   subepithelial a-actin positive myofibroblast proliferation, obliteration
   did not progress from day 7 to 30 and 60 (35, 30, and 33\%,
   respectively). Although more than in normal or host tracheas, the
   obliteration in orthotopic allografts on days 30 and 60 was
   significantly less (P < 0.001) than in heterotopic allografts.
   Conclusions. We describe, for the first time, longterm patency of fully
   histoincompatible orthotopic tracheal allografts in nonimmunosuppressed
   rats. Despite acute alloimmune injury and induction of myofibroblast
   proliferation, epithelial re-growth from the host limited the
   progression of OAD, thus emphasizing the role of epithelium in the
   control of airway obliteration.}},

Abstract = {{Though the hydrogen bond (H-bond) is known since 1920, all attempts to
   predict its geometry and energetics from the structure of the
   interacting molecules have been so far unsuccessful. This problem is
   addressed here through the Electrostatic-Covalent H-Bond Model (ECHBM)
   derived from the systematic analysis of structural and spectroscopic
   data of a large number of O-H ... O H-bonds, according to which: (i)
   weak II-bonds are electrostatic in nature but become increasingly
   covalent with increasing strength, very strong bonds being essentially
   three-centre-four-electron covalent bonds; (ii) strong H-bonds belong to

Abstract = {{AraC regulates transcription of the Escherichia coli arabinose operon,
   binding tandem DNA half-sites in the presence of arabinose and widely
   spaced half-sites in the absence of arabinose. In the structure of the
   AraC N-terminal dimerization domain with bound arabinose, the protein
   dimerizes via an antiparallel coiled-coil interface. The absence of
   bound ligand opens a second, beta-barrel interaction interface that also
   mediates interactions between unliganded AraC dimers in the crystal. The
   larger buried surface area of the beta-barrel interface, as compared
   with the coiled-coil interface, raised the possibility that
   protein-protein interactions mediated by the beta-barrel might play a
   role in ligand-mediated modulation of AraC DNA binding activity. For the
   crystallographically observed beta-barrel interaction to play a role in
   the cell, dimerization via this interface in the absence of arabinose
   would be predicted to be at least as energetically favorable as
   dimerization via the coiled-coil interface. In the study presented here,
   we use analytical ultracentrifugation to determine the oligomeric state
   of the AraC dimerization domain in the presence and absence of
   arabinose. Dimerization of the unliganded protein via the beta-barrel
   interface in the absence of interactions mediated by the coiled-coil
   interface is assayed using a mutant AraC protein with a disrupted
   coiled-coil interface. The results of these studies indicate that
   dimerization via the beta-barrel interface is substantially weaker than
   dimerization via the coiled-coil interface, indicating that the
   crystallographically observed beta-barrel interaction is not relevant to
   in vivo function.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental studies of protein stability often rely on the
   determination of an ``m value{''}, which describes the denaturant
   dependence of the free energy change between two states (Delta G = Delta
   GH(2)O - m{[}denaturant]). Changes in the rn value accompanying site
   specific mutations are usually attributed to structural alterations in
   the native or unfolded ensemble. Here, we provide an example of
   significant reduction in the in value resulting from a subtle deviation
   in two-state behavior not detected by traditional methods. The protein
   that is studied is a variant of Escherchia coli RNase H{*} in which
   three residues predicted to be involved in a partially buried salt
   bridge network were mutated to alanine (R46A, D102A, and B148A).
   Equilibrium denaturant profiles monitored by both fluorescence and
   circular dichroism appeared to be cooperative, and a two-state analysis
   yielded a Delta G(UN) Of approximately -3 kcal/mol with an oz value of
   1.4 kcal mol(-1) M-1 (vs 2.3 for RNase H{*}). Analysis of kinetic
   refolding experiments suggests that the system is actually three-state
   at equilibrium with an appreciable concentration of an intermediate
   state under low denaturant concentrations. The stability of the native
   state determined from a fit of these kinetic data is -6.7 kcal/mol,
   suggesting that the stability determined by traditional two-state
   equilibrium analysis is a gross underestimate. The only hint to this
   loss of two-state behavior was a decrease in the apparent m value, and
   the presence of the equilibrium intermediate was only identified by a
   kinetic analysis. Our work serves as a cautionary note; the possibility
   of a three-state system should be closely addressed before interpreting
   a change in the nz value as a change in the native or unfolded state.}},

Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{A theoretical model of an aeroengine intake-fan system is developed in
   order to show the existence of acoustic resonance in the intake. In
   general this phenomenon can be linked to instabilities in aircraft
   engine inlets.
   The model incorporates a slowly varying duct intake and accounts for the
   swirling flow downstream of the fan. The slow axial variation in
   cross-section gives rise to turning points where upstream-propagating
   acoustic modes are totally reflected into downstream-propagating modes.
   The effect of the swirling flow downstream can be to cut off a mode
   which is cut on upstream of the fan. It is shown that these two aspects
   of the flow, coupled with the effects of the fan (represented by an
   actuator disc), can lead to acoustic modes becoming trapped in the
   intake, thus giving rise to pure acoustic resonance.
   A whole range of system parameters, such as axial, fan and swirl Mach
   numbers, which satisfy the conditions for resonance are identified. The
   effects of a stationary blade row behind the fan are also considered
   leading to a second family of resonant states. In addition we find
   resonance due to reflection of acoustic modes at the open (inlet) end of
   the duct.}},

Abstract = {{Death and injury following exposure of Micrococcus luteus to nisin and

   buffer (pH 6.8, sigma = 4.8 ms/cm at 20 degrees C). Four types of
   experiment were carried out, a single treatment with nisin (100 IU/ml at
   20 degrees C for 2 h), a single PEF treatment, a PEF treatment followed
   by incubation with nisin (as before) and addition of nisin to the
   bacterial suspension prior to the PEF treatment. The application of
   nisin clearly enhanced the lethal effect of PEF treatment. The
   bactericidal effect of nisin reduced viable counts by 1.4 log(10) units.
   Treatment with PEF (50 pulses at 33 kV/cm) resulted in a reduction of
   2.4 log(10) units. PEF treatment followed by nisin caused a reduction of
   5.2 log(10) units in comparison with a 4.9 log(10) units reduction
   obtained with nisin followed by PEF. Injury of surviving cells was
   investigated using media with different concentrations of salt.
   Sublethally damaged cells of M. luteus could not be detected by this
   means, following PEF treatment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{We derive a perturbative series solution to the capacitance between two
   parallel electrodes with irregular profiles. The coefficients in the
   series are calculated using fast Fourier transform algorithms resulting
   in a very fast method. The applicability of the perturbative series
   solution is extended by introducing a spectral window function which can
   make the series converge in cases where the standard series does not
   converge. We show that the filtered perturbative solution is applicable
   to surface profiles with surprisingly large features. However,
   limitations on its applicability to surfaces with high spatial
   frequencies remain. Perturbation theory could be a powerful tool for
   simulating surface-profile images obtained by scanning a capacitive

Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{The stability of a laminar boundary layer has classically been analysed
   in terms of the solutions of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation, which assumes
   that the flow is parallel. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the
   principles underlying the work done by the authors on non-parallel
   flows. This work adopts an asymptotic approach that involves the
   formulation of what we shall call `minimal composite equations' in the
   limit of large Reynolds numbers. These equations include every term that
   is important somewhere, and none that is important nowhere, `importance'
   being defined in terms of errors to some prescribed order in the local
   Reynolds number. This approach leads to a hierarchy of stability
   equations of successively increasing accuracy, including, in the lowest
   order, an ordinary differential equation for similarity flows, a
   low-order parabolic partial differential equation in the next order, and
   finally a `full nonparallel' equation which is equivalent to the
   parabolized stability (partial differential) equations of Bertolotti et
   al.(1). The o.d.e., written here in similarity variables, is similar to
   but not identical with the Orr-Sommerfeld. Typical results from the
   present approach are given to illustrate the nature of the stability
   `surface' derived from the present theory, and the accuracy of the
   computed amplitude distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Over 20 mutations affecting the neurophysin moiety of the vasopressin
   prohormone, have been identified in families suffering from familial
   neurohypophysial diabetes insipidus (FNDI). Only one of these,
   NP87E-->stop, is located outside the central conserved domain implicated
   in sorting of the vasopressin prohormone. To obtain clues about the
   mechanism of induction of FNDI by this atypical mutant we stably
   expressed wild type and NP87E-->stop vasopressin prohormones in
   (neuro)endocrine cell lines. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation
   demonstrated reduced processing of the mutant prohormone to neurophysin.
   In addition, evoked secretion of neurophysin and vasopressin was
   diminished, suggesting that part of the mutant is retained in another
   intracellular compartment than the secretory granules. Indeed,
   immunofluorescence demonstrated accumulation of the truncated
   vasopressin prohormone in the endoplasmic reticulum. We conclude that
   the presence of the vasopressin moiety and the central conserved core of
   the neurophysin domain suffices for sorting and processing, but not for
   efficient endoplasmic reticulum exit of the vasopressin-neurophysin
   molecule. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The human receptor subtype for VIP and PACAP, referred to as VPAC(1)
   receptor, has a large N-terminal extracellular domain which is critical
   for VIP binding. We further investigated this domain by mutating 12
   amino acid residues which could participate in the formation of a tight
   bend (W67) or a coiled coil motif. They were changed to alanine (A) and
   the cDNAs were transiently transfected into Cos cells. All mutants but
   W67A exhibited K-d values similar to that of the wildtype receptor. For
   the W67A mutant, no specific I-125-VIP binding could be observed.
   Mutants at the W67 site were further characterized after stable
   transfection of epitope-tagged VPAC(1) receptor-GFP fusion proteins into
   CHO cells. W67A, W67E, W67H, and W67H mutants neither bound VIP nor
   mediated adenylyl cyclase activation by VIP. The W67F mutant mediated
   stimulation of adenylyl cyclase only at high VIP concentrations.
   Microscopic analysis and antibody binding experiments showed that all
   mutants were similarly expressed at the cell surface of CHO cells.
   Therefore tryptophan 67 in the human VPAC(1) receptor plays a crucial
   role in VIP binding due, in part, to its aromatic moiety. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study, conducted in the French Military
   hospitals, was to monitor the course of the antimicrobial sensibility of
   bacteria isolated from nosocomial infection in intensive care units.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study has been conducted from
   January to December 1998 in all the intensive care units of the French
   Army. All the non-repetitive strains isolated from nosocomial infection
   were collected and senile a reference centre. Antimicrobial
   susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method.
   Beta-lactamase were identified by iso-electro-focalisation. Antibiotics
   choice and interpretative criteria were those of the ``Comite Francais
   de l'Antibiogramme de la societe Francaise de Microbiologie.
   RESULTS: A total of 849 strains are included in this study. Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (20\%) followed by
   Escherichia coli (19\%) Staphylococcus aureus (15\%), coagulase-negative
   Staphylococci (CoNS) (11\%) and Enterococci (7\%).
   Imipenem was the most effective antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae
   (336 isolates; 100\% susceptibility). Gentamicin (92\%), amikacin (92\%)
   third generation cephalosporins (83\%), aztreonam (83\%) and
   ciprofloxacin (78\%) were also very effective.
   Resistance to III generation cephalosporins was correlated with an
   extended spectrum beta-lactamase (BLSE) in 36\% of cases. This ELSE
   could be associated with an over production of the constitutive
   cephalosporinase. The most frequent species producing ELSE were
   Enterobacter aerogenes (75\% of ELSE) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (17\%).
   Among the 172 P. aeruginosa isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility were
   respectively: 71\% for imipenem, 62\%: tobramycin, 60\%: amikacin 59\%:
   ciprofloxacin 59\% piperacillin + tazobactam, 55\% piperacillin, 53\%:
   ceftazidime and 44\% for ticarcillin.
   Seventy per cent of the 96 CoNS and 50.2\% of the 126 S, aureus isolated
   were resistant to methicillin. A strain of S. aureus and 2 CoNS strains
   had intermediate resistance to teicoplanin.
   Twenty per cent of the 59 Enterococci strains isolated were resistant to
   aminopenicillins (10/11 strains of E, faecium), and 9\% presented a high
   level of resistance to gentamicine. One strain of E. faecium was
   resistant to vancomycin.
   CONCLUSION: The evolution of the susceptibility to antibiotics in
   intensive care units reflects the antibiotic pressure and level of
   cross-transmission. High rates of meticillin-resistance among
   staphylococci, of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics among P.
   aeruginosa and of ciprofloxacin among Enterobacteriaceae are shown in
   this study. The implementation of appropriate strategies for
   surveillance and prevention is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Essentiality of dietary calcium (Ca) supplement was investigated in
   fingerling scorpion fish. Four purified diets were formulated with
   supplementation of 0.2\% Ca from Ca-lactate, no supplemental Ca, and 0.2
   and 2.5\% Ca from tricalcium phosphate (TCP), respectively. Each
   experimental diet was fed to three replicate groups of fish (mean
   weight, 0.8 g) for 12 weeks at a water temperature of 24 +/- 0.2 degrees
   C. Significantly lower weight gain was observed in fish fed the
   Ca-unsupplemented diet compared to the control diet with 0.2\% Ca
   supplement from Ca-lactate. The growth of fish fed the diet with a low
   level (0.2\%) of Ca from TCP was similar to that of fish fed the control
   diet. However, a high level (2.5\%) of dietary Ca from TCP significantly
   decreased growth. Calcium and phosphorus contents in whole body and
   vertebrae were similar in fish fed all the diets. A high level of
   dietary Ca from TCP decreased some trace elements in whole body, liver
   and vertebrae. Results suggest that scorpion fish do not obtain adequate
   Ca from seawater for normal growth and a dietary Ca supplement is
   necessary. Although this species can use a low level of dietary TCP as a
   source of Ca for growth, excessive dietary TCP depresses growth and
   negatively affects the contents of some trace elements in tissues.
   Readily available Ca (mono- or dibasic Ca) supplement to the diet
   appears to be essential for optimum growth and for maintaining normal
   mineral levels in tissues of scorpion fish. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Objective To determine whether availability of neonatal intensive care
   cots is a problem in any or all parts of the United Kingdom.
   Design Three month census fi-om 1 April to 30 June 1999 comprising
   simple data sheets on transfers out of tertiary units.
   Setting The 37 largest high risk perinatal centres in the United
   Kingdom.
   Participants One obstetric specialist and one neonatal specialist in
   each centre.
   Main outcome measures Suboptimal care resulting directly from pressure
   on service-that is, transfers out of tertiary units (either in utero or
   after delivery) because the unit was ``full{''} and not because the
   hospital was incapable of providing the care needed.
   Results All units provided data. The number of intensive care cots in
   each unit was between five and 16. During the three months 309 transfers
   occurred (equivalent to 1236 per year), of which 264 were in utero and
   45 postnatal. Sixty five in utero transfers involved multiple births,
   hence the census related to 382 babies (1528 per year). There was
   considerable regional variation. The reason for transfer in most cases
   was ``lack of neonatal beds{''}.
   Conclusions Currently most major perinatal centres in the United Kingdom
   are regularly unable to meet in-house demand; this has implications for
   the service as a whole. The NHS has set no standards to help health
   authorities and primary care groups develop services relating to this
   specialty; such a step may well be an appropriate lever for change.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were first to determine the cumulative
   incidence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the British
   cattle population from July 1986 to June 1997, secondly, to identify
   individual animal-associated risk factors that influenced the age of
   onset of clinical signs in confirmed BSE cases, and, thirdly, to assess
   the effectiveness of the measures introduced to control BSE during the
   epidemic. The analyses were based on the population of British cattle at
   risk, derived from agricultural census data collected between 1986 and
   1996, and BSE case data collected up to June 30, 1997. The unit of
   interest was individual adult cattle recorded on annual agricultural
   censuses between June 1986 and June 1996. Univariate and multivariate
   survival analysis techniques were used to characterise the age of onset
   of clinical signs. In total 167,366 cases of BSE were diagnosed in Great
   Britain up to lune 30, 1997 The cumulative incidence of BSE between July
   1986 and lune 1997 was 1.10 (95 per cent confidence interval {[}CI] 1.09
   to 1.10) cases per 100 adult cattle at risk. Cattle from the South east,
   South west and Eastern regions of England had 4.26 to 5.96 (95 per cent
   CI 4.15 to 6.14) times as great a monthly hazard of being confirmed with
   BSE as cattle from Scotland. Compared with cattle born before June 1985,
   those born between July 1987 and June 1988 had 22.5 (95 per cent CI 22.1
   to 22.8) times the monthly hazard of being confirmed with BSE, whereas
   those born in the 12 months after July 1988 had only 7.39 (95 per cent
   CI 7.24 to 7.54) times the monthly hazard of being confirmed with BSE.
   This reduction in hazard was directly attributable to the ban on the use
   of ruminant protein as a feed instituted in July 1988. Successive
   cohorts from 1989 to 1991 experienced further reductions in the hazard
   of experiencing BSE. The additional decrease in hazard observed for the
   1990 cohort may be attributed to the effect of the Specified Bovine
   Offal ban instituted in September 1990.}},

Abstract = {{The opportunistic fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans, shows a
   marked predilection for the central nervous system (CNS). This can be
   partially explained by its ability to synthesize melanin starting from
   the catecholamines, highly concentrated at the CNS level. Two
   cryptococcal strains, the avirulent non-melanogenic strain Sb26 and the
   virulent melanogenic revertant strain Sb26Rev, were used in a murine
   model of intracerebral (i.c.) infection, in order to evaluate their
   virulence and immunomodulating properties at the cerebral level. We
   found that, unlike Sb26Rev, Sb26 i.c. infection was never lethal
   regardless of the challenging dose. Sb26Rev infection resulted in
   massive CNS tissue damage, associated with little or no cytokine
   response, as established by semi-quantitative reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Differently, Sb26 infection failed to alter
   CNS structure, while inducing IL-12 p40, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma
   and iNOS specific-gene expression as well as IL-12, TNF-alpha and IL-1
   beta cytokine production. Interestingly, all Sb26 infected mice survived
   a subsequent lethal, challenge with Sb26Rev. The phenomenon was
   associated with enhanced IL-12, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta production and
   was strictly specific, as shown by heterologous challenges and delayed
   type of hypersensitivity assay. Overall, we provide evidence that
   protective immunity against cerebral cryptococcosis is established by
   means of an avirulent strain of C. neoformans. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

   Modest changes in ATP potency were observed for mutants at K70R and
   R292K/A (20- and 100-fold decrease, respectively). Mutations at residues
   K68A and K309A reduced the potency of ATP by >1400-fold and prolonged

Abstract = {{The effects of protracted cocaine administration (15 mg/kg i.p., twice a
   day for 9 days) on the circadian pattern of feeding behavior was studied
   in individually housed male Sprague-Dawley rats, maintained under a
   12:12 light:dark cycle. Water and food were available ad libitum and
   food intake was measured twice a day before, during and after withdrawal
   of cocaine (or saline) treatment. Neither total 24-h food intake, nor
   body mass at the end of the experiment, was significantly different
   between cocaine-treated and control animals. However, cocaine
   administration affected the temporal distribution of food consumption.
   During the dark (activity) phase, rats receiving cocaine injections
   consumed significantly less food than control animals, and this effect
   persisted for up to 3 days of cocaine withdrawal. During the light
   (rest) phase, cocaine administration promoted food consumption and a
   significantly higher food intake was also observed during the first five
   cocaine withdrawal days. Continuous monitoring of locomotor activity did
   not reveal significant changes in the circadian pattern of activity
   between the two experimental groups during different treatment periods.
   except for an acute increase in locomotion within an hour after daytime
   cocaine injection. The results of this study demonstrate that
   sub-chronic cocaine administration alters the circadian pattern of rats'
   feeding behavior. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The six dimethylbenzonitriles can be divided into two independent triads
   in their photochemical reactivity. The first triad is comprised of the
   2,3-dimethyl, 3,4-dimethyl, and 2,6-dimethyl isomers (11-2,3, 11-3,4,
   and 11-2,6, respectively); the second triad is comprised of the
   2,4-dimethyl, 2,5-dimethyl, and 3,5-dimethyl isomers (11-2,4, 11-2,5,
   and 11-3,5, respectively). In acetonitrile, phototransposition converts
   the members of one triad to other members of the same triad, although
   only 11-3,4 was reactive enough to have significant conversion
   approaching a steady-state composition. Irradiation in
   2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) resulted in the formation of addition
   products, 6-cyano-X,Y-dimethylbicyclo{[}3.1.0]hex-3-en-2-yl
   2,2,2,-trifluoroethyl ethers, but in significant yield only from 11-3,4
   of the first triad and 11-2,4 of the second triad. The 11-3,4 isomer
   gave seven major regio- and stereoisomers; the 11-2,4 isomer gave three
   different regio- and stereoisomers. These addition products were all
   explained by formation of bicyclo{[}3.1.0]hex-3-en-1-yl cations
   resulting from protonation by TFE at C6 followed by nucleophilic
   trapping by TFE. From these and previous results on aromatic nitriles, a
   consistent mechanistic picture is obtained where the critical carbon in
   determining the products of the phototransposition and photoaddition
   reactions is the cyano substituted one.}},

Abstract = {{(4Z)-9-(5-Carboxypentyl)-2,3,7,8-tetramethyl-(10H)-dipyrrin-1-one (1,
   semirubin), a new dipyrrinone model for one-half of bilirubin, the
   yellow-orange neurotoxic pigment of jaundice, was synthesized following
   Friedel-Crafts acylation of 2,3,7,8-tetramethyl-(10H)-dipyrrin-1-one (5)
   with the half-ester acid chloride of adipic acid. Unlike other
   dipyrrinone models for bilirubin, such as the xanthobilirubic acids,
   which engage only in intermolecular hydrogen bonding, 1 is unique in
   having been designed and found to engage in intramolecular hydrogen
   bonding, between the carboxylic acid and the dipyrrinone lactam and
   pyrrole. This important conformation-determining structural
   characteristic, shared by 1 and bilirubin, renders them less polar than
   their methyl esters and leaves them monomeric in nonpolar solvents,
   where their esters are dimeric. The corresponding 10-oxo analogue (3) of
   1 serves as a model for 10-oxo-bilirubin, a presumed bilirubin
   metabolite in alternate pathways for bilirubin excretion. Like 1, 3 is
   found to engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Unlike the methyl
   ester of 1, the ethyl ester of 3 is not intermolecularly hydrogen bonded
   in nonpolar solvents.}},

Abstract = {{Small noble-gas droplets are generated by adiabatic expansion and travel

   excited trimers. The heat released by condensation and coagulation of
   the Ag atoms on the droplets causes continuous evaporation of the
   noble-gas atoms, so that under suitable conditions even light emission

Abstract = {{The splicing endonuclease from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AF) belongs to
   the homodimeric family of splicing endonucleases, thought to have
   evolved from the homotetrameric endonucleases. We report here the
   crystal structure of the AF endonuclease determined at 2.8 Angstrom. The
   crystal structure of the full-length AF endonuclease contains a
   homodimer, with each monomer consisting of two homologous repeats joined
   together by an extended polypeptide chain of ten amino acid residues.
   The C-terminal repeat has a strong homology to that of a single subunit
   of the previously determined homotetrameric tRNA splicing endonuclease
   from Methanococcus jannaschii (MT), indicating its role in catalysis.
   The N-terminal repeat is a more degenerate form of the MJ enzyme. Thus
   the N-terminal repeat is a ``non-active{''} endonuclease fold evolved
   from the ``active{''} one. By detailed comparison of the structures of
   the N-terminal and the C-terminal repeats, the binding region for RNA
   substrates containing a bulge-helix-bulge motif can be identified. Based
   on the identified RNA binding region, a cation-pi interaction is
   suggested to be responsible for coordinating activities between the two
   active sites. In addition, the full-length AF endonuclease can adopt a
   higher-ordered fibrous structure in solution, as revealed by the unusual
   crystallographic packing interactions and other biochemical analysis.
   This 4(3)-fold fibrous structure adopted by the full-length enzyme is
   inaccessible to the RNA substrate and is largely stabilized by the first
   60 amino acid residues. A mutated form of AF endonuclease with its first
   60 residues removed catalyzes the cleavage reaction at a significantly
   higher rate. Whether there is any role in vivo for this
   structure-mediated modulation of activity remains to be determined. (C)

Abstract = {{Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) mRNA levels were measured in
   lymphocytes obtained from a cohort of university students and clinically
   diagnosed anxious patients. The average level of PER mRNA was decreased
   in anxious patients compared to a control group. This data confirms
   previously published results, but it also indicates that PER mRNA levels
   cannot be used as a sole diagnostic measure of anxiety because the range
   of the individual PER mRNA levels of the anxious group overlapped the
   range of the PER mRNA levels of the control group, PER mRNA levels in
   students following academic examinations were increased in some
   individuals and decreased in others. In the same cohort of students
   individual levels of cortisol and prolactin were predominantly increased
   and decreased respectively. There was no correlation between the
   individual changes in the hormone levels or PER mRNA, which suggests
   that each of these parameters is affected by different environmental and
   physiological factors. Lymphocyte PER mRNA measurement is a useful
   additional methodology for studying human stress responses however, its
   use in clinical studies would require the elucidation of PBR's
   physiological role. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing population fluctuations and their causes is a major theme
   in population ecology. The debate is on the relative merits of
   density-dependent and density-independent effects. One paradigm (revived
   by the research on global warming and its relation to long-term
   population data) states that fluctuations in population densities can
   often be accounted for by external noise. Several empirical models have
   been suggested to support this view Mt followed this by assuming a given
   population skeleton dynamics (Ricker dynamics and second-order
   autoregressive dynamics) topped off with noise composed of low- and
   high-frequency components. Our aim was to determine to what extent the
   modulated population dynamics correlate with the noise signal. High
   correlations (with time-lag -1) were observed with both model categories
   in the region of stable dynamics, but not in the region of periodic or
   complex dynamics. This finding is not very sensitive to low-frequency
   noise. High correlations throughout the entire range of dynamics are
   only achievable when the impact of the noise is very high. Fitted
   parameter values of skeleton dynamics modulated with noise are prone to
   err substantially. This casts doubt as to what degree the underlying
   dynamics are any more recognizable after being modulated hv the external
   noise.}},

Abstract = {{G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is able to phosphorylate a
   variety of agonist-occupied G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and plays
   an important role in GPCR modulation, However, recent studies suggest
   additional cellular functions for GRK2. Phosducin and phosducin-like
   protein (PhLP) are cytosolic proteins that bind G beta gamma subunits
   and act as regulators of G-protein signaling. In this report, we
   identify phosducin and PhLP as novel GRK2 substrates, The
   phosphorylation of purified phosducin and PhLP by recombinant GRK2
   proceeds rapidly and stoichiometrically (0.82 +/- 0.1 and 0.83 +/- 0.09
   mol of P-i/mol of protein, respectively). The phosphorylation reactions
   exhibit apparent K-m values in the range of 40-100 nM, strongly
   suggesting that both proteins could be endogenous targets for GRK2
   activity. Our data show that the site of phosducin phosphorylation by
   GRK2 is different and independent from that previously reported for the
   cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Analysis of GRK2 phosphorylation of a
   variety of deletion mutants of phosducin and PhLP indicates that the
   critical region for GRK2 phosphorylation is localized in the C-terminal
   domain of both phosducin and PhLP (between residues 204 and 245 and 195
   and 218, respectively). This region is important for the interaction of
   these proteins with G beta gamma subunits, Phosphorylation of phosducin
   by GRK2 markedly reduces its G beta gamma binding ability, suggesting
   that GRK2 may modulate the activity of the phosducin protein family by
   disrupting this interaction. The identification of phosducin and PhLP as
   new substrates for GRK2 further expands the cellular roles of this
   kinase and suggests new mechanisms for modulating GPCR signal
   transduction.}},

   of PrRP-R in human pituitary adenomas. Pituitary adenomas were collected
   from 13 patients by transsphenoidal resection. Six patients had
   prolactin-secreting adenomas, three had adrenocorticotropic
   hormone-secreting adenomas, one had a growth hormone-secreting adenoma,
   and three had non-secreting adenomas. All pituitary adenomas examined by
   reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis expressed
   PrRP-R. When semiquantitative competitive PCR was performed to determine
   the relative amounts of the PrRP-R mRNA expression level, there was no
   correlation between plasma prolactin levels and PrRP-R expression
   levels. These results suggest that the plasma prolactin level is

   time point). The GFAP expression was elevated in astrocytes (compared to
   the normal level of immunodensity) during the period peaking on day 3-6
   following the CSD. The hsp27 immunoreactivity was also elevated in
   astrocytes from day 1 to 12 peaking on day 1 and 6, but there was no
   expression of hsp70 during the period following CSD. The
   immunoreactivity for BDNF was elevated in neurons from day 0 to 18
   peaking on day 1 and 6. The protein levels of BDNF in the neocortex were
   significantly elevated from day 0 to 12 peaking on days 0 and 6
   (compared to the normal level) (P<0.05). Using a laser-scanning confocal
   imaging system, the BDNF-like immunoreactivity in neuronal nuclei was
   found to increase linearly peaking on day 12, which correlated well with
   the development of infarct tolerance. The intranuclear increase in
   BDNF-like protein might contribute to the induction of infarct tolerance
   in the brain. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of near-ultraviolet radiation (UV-A; 325-390 nm, peak at 365 nm)
   on melatonin content and activity of serotonin N-acetyltransferase
   (AA-NAT; a key regulatory enzyme in melatonin biosynthesis) were
   examined in the retina of chickens. Acute exposure of dark-adapted
   animals to UV-A light produced a marked decline in melatonin content and
   AA-NAT activity of the retina. The magnitude of the observed changes was
   dependent upon duration of the light pulse and age of chickens, with
   1-2-week old birds being more sensitive to UV-A action than 6-7-week old
   ones. The decrease in the nocturnal AA-NAT activity evoked by a 5-min
   UV-A pulse gradually deepened during the first 30 min after the return
   of chickens to constant darkness, then the enzyme activity began to
   rise, reaching nearly complete restoration within 2.5 hr. Systemic
   administration to chickens of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine tan inhibitor of
   catecholamine synthesis; 0.3 g/kg) blocked the suppressive effect of W-A
   light on retinal AA-NAT activity. Haloperidol, sulpiride (blockers of
   D2-family of dopamine (DA) receptors) and
   2-chloro-11-(4-methylpiperazino)dibenz{[}bf] (an antagonist of D-4-DA
   receptors), given intraocularly (1-100 nmol/eye) prevented the UV-A
   light-evoked decrease in AA-NAT activity in the chicken retina in a
   dose-dependent manner, while raclopride (300 nmol/eye), an antagonist of
   D-2/D-3-DA receptors, was ineffective. In dark-adapted chickens exposure
   to UV-A light increased the DA content of the retina. It is concluded
   that UV-A radiation, similar to visible light, potently suppresses
   melatonin biosynthesis in the retina of chicken, with a D-4-dopaminergic
   signal playing the role of an intermediate in this action. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Dynamic activation of ion channels formed by colicin Ia; incorporated
   into a planar bilayer lipid membrane (BLM) was investigated by the
   voltage clamp technique using different step voltage stimuli. We have
   demonstrated a critical resting interval, Delta t(c), between two
   identical successive voltage pulses. If the second pulse is applied
   within Delta t(c), it produces a predictable current response. On the
   contrary, if the second pulse is applied after Delta t(c), the current
   response cannot be reliably predicted. Computer simulations based on an
   idealized mathematical model, developed in this paper, qualitatively
   reproduce the system's dynamic responses to stimulus trains. The
   behavior of the ion channels, when the resting period exceeds Delta
   t(c), may be interpreted as a transient gain or loss or resetting of
   memory, as revealed by a specific sequence of electrical pulses used for
   stimulation. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrafast singlet excited state energy transfer occurs from the
   monomeric bacteriopheophytin (H) and bacteriochlorophyll (B)
   chromophores to the primary electron donor or special pair (P) in
   bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers. Because of rapid quenching of
   the singlet excited state of B by energy transfer to P, B-1 emission has
   not previously been observed in functional reaction centers. Using
   fluorescence upconversion, spontaneous fluorescence associated with the
   monomeric bacteriochlorophylls is observed for excitation of the
   monomeric bacteriochlorophylls and bacteriopheophytins at 85 K. The
   decay kinetics of the fluorescence match the kinetics of the rise of
   emission from P-1, the ultimate acceptor of singlet energy. Together
   with measurements of the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, the data
   suggest that B-1 is populated in the energy transfer pathway from H-1 to
   P. By exciting H in wild-type and in the reaction center mutant M182HL,
   where contributions from the chromophores in the B sites on the L and M
   sides are spectrally resolved, the amplitudes of the kinetic traces at
   several wavelengths between 790 and 825 nm can be used to construct the
   time-resolved emission spectrum of B-1. The Stokes shift of the
   accessory bacteriochlorophylls in wild-type on the femtosecond time
   scale is dose to zero, while for the monomeric bacteriopheophytin in the
   B-M binding site in the M182HL mutant, the Stokes shift is less than 100
   cm(-1). These results have significant implications fur the mechanism of
   ultrafast energy transfer in the reaction center.}},

   properties of the LC's were studied experimentally for different
   orientations of the confining surfaces as a function of the film
   thickness, humidity, and duration of the experiment. It was shown that
   upon progressive confinement the medium-range forces in the layer
   noticeably increase when the twisting angle between confining surfaces
   increases. It was demonstrated that increase in humidity diminishes
   anchoring of the LC's to the surface.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of controlling the impact dynamics of an inverted pendulum
   is addressed. Starting from the optimal excitation for avoiding chaos
   obtained in previous works, interest is in increasing its practical
   performance and its application range.; Two different implementations of
   the control procedure are developed in order to fulfil specific
   technical requirements of the system dynamics. They involve alternate
   use of one-side optimal and harmonic excitations, aimed at increasing
   the time spent by the hitting mass in the controlled potential well; or
   of right and left optimal excitations, aimed at reducing the scattered

   peptoid cholecystokinin receptor antagonists}},

Abstract = {{The two hormones cholecystokinin and gastrin share the same C-terminal
   sequence of amino acids, namely
   Gly(29)-Trp(30)-Met(31)-Asp(32)-Phe(33)-NH2. Nevertheless, this
   congruence has not precluded using this structure to develop selective
   ligands for either CCK1 or CCK2 receptors. Manipulation of the
   hydrophobic residues at positions 31 and 33 gave a series of CCK1
   tripeptide antagonists, typified by
   N-t-BOC-Trp-2-Nal-Asp-2-(phenyl)ethylamide (pK(B) 6.8 +/- 0.3).
   Molecular modeling was used to identify the bioactive conformation of
   these CCK1-selective compounds and prompted the design of new peptoid
   structures. We aimed to maintain the conformation of the parent series
   by exploiting patterns of hydrogen-bonding and pi-stacking interactions
   present in the original molecule, rather than introducing additional
   covalent bonds. The prototype,
   N-(succinyl-o-Asp-2-phenylethylamido)-L-Trp-2-( 2-naphthyl) ethylamide,
   was a potent and selective CCK1 antagonist (pK(B) 7.2 +/- 0.3).
   Furthermore, the new series showed patterns of biological activity that
   mirrored those of the parent tripeptides. These compounds contain
   elements of both peptide primary and secondary structure and represent a
   novel approach to designing peptidomimetics. Interesting results were
   obtained from comparing models of a representative tripeptide CCK1
   antagonist with a conformation of CCK30-33 that others have proposed to
   be responsible for its activity at the CCK2 receptor. The results
   suggest that CCK1 and CCK2 receptors recognize enatiomeric dispositions
   of the Trp(30) indole, Asp(32) carboxylic acid, and C-terminal phenyl
   groups arrayed about a common backbone configuration. This ``functional
   chirality{''} may underpin the mechanism by which these closely related
   receptor systems bind CCK30-33 and explain patterns of selectivity
   observed with optical isomers of a number of peptoid and nonpeptide
   ligands.}},

   result, 30 days of data from one IGEX detector, which has an energy
   threshold E-thr similar to 4 keV, have been considered. These data
   improve the exclusion limits derived from other ionization (non-thermal)
   germanium detector experiments in the similar to 50 GeV DAMA region, and
   show that with a moderate improvement of the background below 10 keV,
   the DAMA region may be tested with an additional 1 kg-year of exposure.

Abstract = {{The surface organometallic fragment (equivalent to SiO)(2)Cr=CHCMe3
   initiates the polymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene at room
   temperature in the absence of organoaluminum or other activators. The
   kinetics at the gas-solid interface were studied by in situ IR
   spectroscopy in a constant volume, variable pressure reactor. At low
   pressures, the reaction is first order in P(C2H4), first order in the
   number of moles of chromium, and linearly dependent on the Cr loading on
   silica. The second-order rate constant for polymerization is (177 +/- 3)
   s(-1) (mol Cr)(-1) at 21 degrees C, and is virtually unchanged upon
   subsequent additions of ethylene to the catalyst. The kinetic isotope
   effect, k(C2H4)/k(C2D4), is a meagre 1.29. The temperature dependence of
   the second-order rate constants yields Delta H double dagger(obs) =
   (30.2 +/- 0.9) kJ/mol and Delta S double dagger(obs) = (-99 +/- 3)
   J/(K.mol). These values are consistent with a propagation mechanism of
   agostically assisted migratory insertion at an alkylchromium(IV) active
   site. They are inconsistent with an alternating alkylidene/metallacycle
   mechanism requiring rate-determining C-H cleavage. The rate of
   polymerization is accelerated by a factor of 3.2 in the presence of 18
   mol \% H-2 Homopolymerization of 1-hexene is only 4.7 times slower than
   that of ethylene, an effect attributed to weaker preequilibrium binding
   of the substituted olefin which is partially compensated by faster
   migratory insertion. Copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene is
   random. It results in slower incorporation of ethylene but faster
   incorporation of 1-hexene relative to their respective
   homopolymerization rates.}},

Abstract = {{Alcoholysis and reverse hydrolysis reactions were performed
   enzymatically in one-phase water-saturated 1-heptanol systems. Lactose
   or glucose was used as substrate to produce heptyl-beta-galactoside
   and/or heptyl-beta-glucoside, respectively. When alcoholysis of lactose
   was performed at 37 degrees C with beta-galactosidase from Escherichia
   coli, the initial rate was 14 nmol/mL min, and the limiting factors were
   the poor solubility of the substrate in 1-heptanol and low thermal
   stability of the enzyme. When a hyperthermophilic beta-glycosidase was
   used at 90 degrees C, the rate was 3.14-fold higher; in this case a
   higher concentration of soluble lactose in the water-saturated heptanol
   was available to the enzyme due to the higher temperature. The
   hyperthermophilic beta-glycosidase was also able to use glucose and
   galactose as substrates to achieve the reverse hydrolysis reaction. As a
   consequence, when lactose was used as substrate, heptyl-beta-galactoside
   was formed by alcoholysis, while the released glucose moiety was used in
   a secondary reverse hydrolysis reaction to produce
   heptyl-beta-glucoside. Both reactions followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics
   behavior. Neither lactose nor heptyl glycosides were hydrolyzed by this
   enzyme in water-saturated heptanol. However, the conversion was limited
   by a strong product inhibition and the formation of oligosaccharides,
   especially at high substrate concentrations, reducing the final
   glycoside yield. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

   Epidemiologic Follow-up Study, conducted in 1982-1984, 1986, 1987, and
   1992.
   Participants A total of 8032 dentate adults aged 25 to 74 years with no
   reported history of cardiovascular disease, including 1859 individuals
   with periodontitis, 2421 with gingivitis, and 3752 with healthy
   periodontal tissues.
   Main Outcome Measure First occurrence of death from CHD or
   hospitalization due to CHD, or revascularization procedures, obtained
   from death certificates and medical records, by baseline periodontal
   status.
   Results During follow-up, 1265 individuals had at least 1 CHD event,
   including CHD fatality (n=468) or at least 1 hospitalization with a
   diagnosis of CHD (n=1022), including coronary revascularization
   procedures (n=155). After adjustment for known cardiovascular risk
   factors, gingivitis was not associated with CHD (hazard ratio, 1.05;
   95\% confidence interval. 0.88-1.26), while periodontitis was associated
   with a nonsignificant increased risk for CHD event (hazard ratio, 1.14;
   95\% confidence interval, 0.96-1.36).
   Conclusion This study did not find convincing evidence of a causal
   association be tween periodontal disease and CHD risk.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an HIV-based lentiviral vector that expresses a 1-kb
   antisense mRNA directed against the HIV-1 mRNAs containing env
   sequences. The expression of antisense env mRNAs (envAS) does not
   inhibit the synthesis of p24 expressed from the HIV-1 helper plasmid
   used to package the vector, as this helper has a deletion in the env
   gene. This allows the production of high-titer VSV-G pseudotyped
   lentiviral particles. In challenge experiments using unselected
   populations of SupT1 cells transduced with this vector, a complete
   inhibition of HIV-1 replication was observed for long periods of irt
   vitro culture, even at high HIV-1 infectious doses. The potent
   inhibition of HIV-1 replication by this vector correlated with a low
   occurrence of mobilization of the vector to previously untransduced
   cells. The infectivity of the wild-type HIV-1 that escapes inhibition
   was highly inhibited, suggesting that the vector is providing HIV-1
   inhibition of replication not only due to its antisense effect but also
   by competing for encapsidation and mobilization to noninfected cells.}},

   the minima was located only at the MP2//B3LYP level. The barrier heights

   levels, respectively, and methyl substitution did not affect appreciably
   this value. Fourier expansion terms and bond orders were used to explain
   the origins of the rotational barrier in terms of pi conjugation,

   which remains poorly constrained. The metallicity increases with
   increasing gravity and is below the solar value unless G1 229B is a
   high-gravity brown dwarf with log g (cgs) approximate to 5.5. The NH3
   abundance is determined from both the Hand the K-band spectra, which
   probe two different levels in the atmosphere. We find that the abundance
   from the K-band data is well below that expected from chemical
   equilibrium, which we interpret as strong evidence for dynamical
   transport of NH3 in the atmosphere. This is consistent with the previous
   detection of CO and provides additional constraints on the dynamics of
   the atmosphere of this T dwarf.}},

Pages = {{468-488}},
Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{The excitation of acoustic waves is studied using three-dimensional
   numerical simulations of the nonmagnetic solar atmosphere and the upper
   convection zone. Transient acoustic waves in the atmosphere are excited
   at the top of the convective zone (the cooling layer) and immediately
   above in the convective overshoot zone, by small granules that undergo a
   rapid collapse, in the sense that upflow reverses to downflow, on a
   timescale shorter than the atmospheric acoustic cutoff period (3
   minutes). These collapsing granules tend to be located above downflows
   at the boundaries of mesogranules where the upward enthalpy flux is
   smaller than average. An extended downdraft between larger cells is
   formed at the site of the collapse. The waves produced are long
   wavelength, gravity modified acoustic waves with periods close to the 3
   minute cutoff period of the solar atmosphere. The oscillation is
   initially horizontally localized with a size of about 1 Mm. The wave
   amplitude decays in time as energy is transported horizontally and
   vertically away from the site of the event. Observed ``acoustic
   events{''} and darkening of intergranular lanes could be explained by
   this purely hydrodynamical process. Furthermore, the observed
   ``internetwork bright grains{''} in the Ca II H and K line cores and
   associated shock waves in the chromosphere may also be linked to such
   wave transients.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously reported that myo-inositol uptake and metabolism is
   reduced in human fibroblasts derived from patients with ataxia
   telangiectasia (AT). Treating normal fibroblasts with 10-100 mu M
   wortmannin duplicates some of the phenotypic properties of AT
   fibroblasts including the decrease in myo-inositol accumulation. In the
   present study we examined whether treatment of other types of mammalian
   cells with wortmannin or LY294002 altered myo-inositol uptake. Cultured
   bovine aorta endothelial cells or 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with
   either wortmannin or LY294002, and afterwards, myo-inositol uptake and
   SMIT mRNA levels were determined. Incubating cultured bovine aorta
   endothelial cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes with either wortmannin or
   LY294002 caused a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in
   myo-inositol accumulation that was independent of changes in SMIT mRNA
   levels. The effect of wortmannin and LY294002 on myo-inositol
   accumulation was not due to an increase in myo-inositol secretion. The
   effect of LY294002 on myo-inositol accumulation was reversible.
   Furthermore, the LY294002-induced decrease in myo-inositol accumulation
   was specific since the uptake of serine or choline by cultured bovine
   aorta endothelial cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with LY294002 was
   not significantly decreased. Co-incubation of cultured bovine aorta

Abstract = {{A novel comb water-soluble associative polymer (hydrophobically modified
   alkali-soluble emulsion (HASE)), comprising of a random copolymer of
   methacrylic acid (MAA), ethyl acrylate (EA), and 1 mol \% of
   hydrophobically modified macromonomers, was studied using laser light
   scattering and rheological techniques. The hydrophobic substituents are
   separated from the backbone by a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG or PEG)
   spacer chain. The hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic substituents and the
   length of PEO spacers control the microstructure of the aggregates or
   clusters. In dilute solution regime, the relaxation times of both
   unimers and aggregates are almost independent of hydrophobic groups and
   PEO spacer length. The aggregates are formed via the closed-association
   mechanism, and the balance of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions
   controls their microstructures. However, by varying the hydrophobicity
   and the length of the PEO spacer chains, the internal conformation of
   the aggregates changes. Results from static and dynamic light scattering
   are consistent with the trends observed from rheological measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) with pendent N,N-diethyldifhiocarbamate
   groups (PVC-SR) was prepared through the reaction of PVC with sodium
   N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate (NaSR) in butanone and used as a
   photoinitiator for the grafting polymerization of three vinyl monomers
   {[}styrene (St), methyl methacrylate (MMA), and acrylamide (Am)]. The
   effects of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation time, PVC-SR amount, and the
   monomer amount on grafting and grafting efficiency were investigated.
   The results showed that PVC-SR could initiate the polymerization of
   three vinyl monomers effectively and obtained crosslinked copolymers.
   The grafting and grafting efficiency of styrene and methyl methacrylate
   were higher than those of acrylamide. The polymerization activity of
   three monomers was acrylamide > methyl methacrylate > styrene. By
   analyzing the UV spectrum of PVC-SR with a different irradiation time,
   it was confirmed that PVC-SR was dissociated mainly into macromolecular
   the sulfur radical PVC-S and the small molecular carbon radical
   C(S)N(C2H5)(2); the grafting polymerization mechanism was discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{Little is known about human anti-idiotypic antibodies. Phage display
   methodology was used to reconstruct these antibodies from lupus
   patients, which recognize a subset (T14(+)) of anti-DNA antibodies.
   Antigen-specific B cells were isolated from the blood using a peptide
   based on a complementarity determining region (V(H)CDR3) of the
   prototypic T14(+) antibody, cDNA fragments of the V-H and V-L genes
   prepared from the cells were expressed as phage displayed single chain
   Fv (scFv) fragments using the pCANTAB-5E phagemid vector. From a
   reactive clone obtained, the Ig genes used were identified to be VH3,
   D5-D3, J(H)4b, VkappaI and J(kappa)2. The heavy chain was highly
   mutated, especially in CDR3, which bears mutations mostly of the
   replacement type; this region is also unusual in being extremely long
   due to a D-D fusion. In contrast, a mouse hybridoma antibody, made to
   the same T14(+) peptide and transformed as a scFv fragment, uses a short
   V(H)CDR3 comprising five amino acids, three of which are tyrosines.
   Tyrosines may be important for antigen binding because two of these also
   exist in the human V(H)CDR3. The light chains of both antibodies may
   also contribute to the specificity of the protein, because their V-L
   segments, including the CDRs, are highly homologous to each other. (C)

Abstract = {{Building on a recently introduced technique for continuous online
   monitoring of absolute weight-average molecular weight M-w of polymers
   during polymerization reactions, a method is introduced here for finding
   a useful approximation to the polymer mass distribution and moments at
   each instant during the reaction. The method is based on finding the
   instantaneous weight-average mass at each instant, M-w,M-inst, from an
   expression involving the derivative of the cumulative M-w, which is
   directly monitored online. The method is restricted to chain growth
   polymerization where individual chains are produced and terminate
   rapidly compared to the overall time it takes for complete monomer
   conversion to polymer. Data from two different polymerization
   experiments that were monitored online were then analyzed. One of these
   experiments is from a reaction for poly(vinylpyrrolidone), which
   produced a bimodal population, and the other from a reaction that
   produced a broad, unimodal distribution. Finally, other possibilities
   for online polydispersity measurements are briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe the pattern of cancer among people living in
   rural and remote Indigenous communities in Queensland and to consider
   what implications the results have for cancer control.
   Design and setting: Descriptive analysis of data on incidence and
   mortality from the population-based Queensland Cancer Registry for the
   years 1982-1996.
   Main outcome measures: Age-standardised incidence and mortality rates
   for different cancer sites.
   Results: The pattern of cancer was different from that found in the
   Queensland population as a whole. Of all the cancer sites, cervical
   cancer showed the biggest difference: the age-standardised incidence was
   4.7 times the State average (95\% CI, 3.2-6.6) and the mortality rate
   was 13.4 times the State average (95\% CI, 7.8-21.4). Rates of lung
   cancer and other smoking-related cancers, although not as high as those
   for cervical cancer, were also significantly higher than the Queensland
   average, while rates for prostate and colorectal cancer were
   significantly lower.
   Conclusion: The cancers that are over-represented among Indigenous
   people are amenable to preventive measures. The cancer burden among
   Indigenous people could be reduced by lowering the prevalence of smoking
   and improving participation in cervical cancer screening and follow-up
   of screening-detected abnormalities.}},

Abstract = {{A new method was devised to visualize actin polymerization induced by

   entails masking myofibrillar filamentous (F)-actin with jasplakinolide,

   and then probing new actin assembly with fluorescent phalloidin. With
   this procedure, actin polymerization associated with newly induced
   acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering by heparin-binding
   growth-associated molecule-coated beads and by agrin was observed, The
   beads induced local F-actin assembly that colocalized with AChR clusters
   at bead-muscle contacts, whereas both the actin cytoskeleton and AChR
   clusters induced by bath agrin application were diffuse. By expressing a
   green fluorescent protein-coupled version of cortactin, a protein that
   binds to active F-actin, the dynamic nature of the actin cytoskeleton
   associated with new AChR clusters was revealed. In fact, the motive
   force generated by actin polymerization propelled the entire
   bead-induced AChR cluster with its attached bead to move in the plane of
   the membrane. In addition, actin polymerization is also necessary for
   the formation of both bead and argin-induced AChR clusters as well as
   phosphotyrosine accumulation, as shown by their blockage by latrunculin
   A, a toxin that sequesters globular (G)-actin and prevents F-actin
   assembly. These results show that actin polymerization induced by
   synaptogenic signals is necessary for the movement and formation of AChR
   clusters and implicate a role of F-actin as a postsynaptic scaffold for
   the assembly of structural and signaling molecules in neuromuscular
   junction formation.}},

Abstract = {{The dealumination of mordenite was carried out at 100 degrees C with
   nitric and oxalic acid; after calcination, the samples were
   characterised using various techniques. The bulk composition showed that
   both acids were very effective in removing aluminium, but that aluminium
   was extracted at a higher rate by oxalic acid even at low
   concentrations. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) images showed the formation of a secondary pore system
   in the zeolite after treatment with nitric acid but not with oxalic
   acid. NMR analysis revealed that, at the same Si/Al ratio, the mordenite
   was almost free of extra-framework aluminium (EFAl) after nitric acid
   extraction, whereas after extraction with oxalic acid half of the
   aluminium was octahedrally co-ordinated. The Si(0Al) peak in the Si-29
   NMR was found to be split when dealumination with nitric acid was
   carried out due to the presence of less EFAl. Treatment with oxalic acid
   led to the formation of a larger number of lattice defects. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The influence of organonitrogen Ligands on the network structure of
   molybdenum oxides was examined by preparing three new molybdenum oxide
   phases {[}MoO3(4,4'-bpy)(0.5)] (MOXI-8), {[}HxMoO3(4,4'-bpy)(0.5)]
   (MOXI-9) and {[}MoO3-(triazole)(0.5)] (MOXI-32). The structure of
   {[}MoO3(4,4'-bpy)(0.5)] consists of layers of corner-sharing MoO5N
   octahedra, buttressed by bridging 4,4'-bipyridyl ligands into a
   three-dimensional covalently bonded organic-inorganic composite
   material. Partial reduction of {[}MoO3(4,4'-bpy)(0.5)] yields the
   mixed-valence material {[}HxMoO3(4,4'-bpy)(0.5)] (x approximate to 0.5).
   The most apparent structural change upon reduction is found in the
   Mo-ligand bond lengths of the MoO5N octahedra, which exhibit the usual
   (2 + 2 + 2) pattern in {[}MoO3(4,4'-bpy)(0.5)] and a more regular (5 +
   1) pattern in {[}HxMoO3(4,4'-bpy)(0.5)]. Substitution of triazole for
   4,4'-bipyridine yields {[}MoO3(triazole)(0.5)], which retains the layer
   motif of corner-sharing MoO5N octahedra but with distinct sinusoidal
   ruffling in contrast to planar layers of {[}MoO3(4,4'-bpy)(0.5)] and
   {[}HxMoO3(4,4'-bpy)(0.5)]. The folding reflects the ligand constraints
   imposed by the triazole ligand that bridges adjacent Mo sites within a

Abstract = {{Much heavier sfermions of the first-two generations than the other
   superparticles provide a natural explanation for the flavor and CP
   problems in the supersymmetric Standard Model (SUSY SM). However, the
   heavy sfermions may drive the mass squareds for the light third
   generation sfermions to be negative through two-loop renormalization
   group (RG) equations, breaking color and charge. Introducing extra
   matters to the SUSY SM, it is possible to construct models where the
   sfermion masses are RG invariant at the two-loop level in the limit of
   vanishing gaugino-mass and Yukawa-coupling contributions. We calculate
   the finite corrections to the light sfermion masses at the two-loop
   level in the models. We find that the finite corrections to the
   light-squark mass squareds are negative and can be less than (0.3-1)\%
   of the heavy-squark mass squareds, depending on the number and the
   parameters of the extra matters. We also discuss whether such models
   realized by the U(1)(X) gauge interaction at the GUT scale can satisfy
   the constraints from Delta m(K) and epsilon(K) naturally. When both the
   left- and right-handed down-type squarks of the first-two generations
   have common U(l)(X) charges, the supersymmetric contributions to Delta
   m(K) and epsilon(K) are sufficiently suppressed without spoiling
   naturalness, even if the flavor-violating supergravity contributions to
   the sfermion mass matrices are included. When only the right-handed
   squarks of the first-two generations have a common U(1)(X) charge, we
   can still satisfy the constraint from Delta m(K) naturally, but evading
   the bound from epsilon(K) requires the CP phase smaller than 10(-2). (C)

Abstract = {{Airway epithelia are positioned at the interface between the body and
   the environment, and generate complex signaling responses to inhaled
   toxins and other stresses. Luminal mechanical stimulation of airway
   epithelial cells produces a propagating wave of elevated intracellular
   Ca2+ that coordinates components of the integrated epithelial stress
   response. In polarized airway epithelia, this response has been
   attributed to IP3 permeation through gap junctions, Using a combination
   of approaches, including enzymes that destroy extracellular nucleotides,
   purinergic receptor desensitization, and airway cells deficient in
   purinoceptors, we demonstrated that Ca2+ waves induced by luminal
   mechanical stimulation in polarized airway epithelia were initiated by
   the release of the 5' nucleotides, ATP and UTP, across both apical and
   basolateral membranes. The nucleotides released into the extracellular
   compartment interacted with purinoceptors at both membranes to trigger
   Ca2+ mobilization. Physiologically, apical membrane nucleotide-release
   coordinates airway mucociliary clearance responses (mucin and salt,
   water secretion, increased ciliary beat frequency), whereas basolateral
   release constitutes a paracrine mechanism by which mechanical stresses
   signal adjacent cells not only within the epithelium, but other cell
   types (nerves, inflammatory cells) in the submucosa. Nucleotide-release
   ipsilateral and contralateral to the surface stimulated constitutes a
   unique mechanism by which epithelia coordinate local and distant airway
   defense responses to mechanical stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Synthesis of TiO2/C composite xerogels and aerogels were obtained by
   polymerization of a mixture of resorcinol, formaldehyde and tetrabutyl
   orthotitanate. Samples so obtained were dried with supercritical CO2
   (aerogel) or at 110 degrees C in an oven (xerogel). The aerogel was
   prepared with two different initial TiO2 contents of 30 and 49\%. Both
   aerogels and thr xerogel were subsequently carbonized in an inert
   atmosphere at 500 and 900 degrees C. Surface area and porosity of the
   samples were measured by CO2 adsorption at 273 K and mercury
   porosimetry; X-ray diffraction (MD) technique was used to determine the
   crystallographic structure of the inorganic constituent of the composite
   (anatase or rutile); and acid-base surface characteristics of these
   materials were studied by testing them as catalysts in the decomposition
   reaction of isopropanol. Finally, some of these samples were used as
   supports for tungsten oxide catalysts and also tested in the above
   reaction. The composite aerogel with the lower TiO2 content and its
   carbonized derivatives had the more developed meso- and macroporosity,
   indicative of the importance of both the supercritical drying process of
   these materials and of the TiO2 content. In this case, the composite
   aerogel carbonized at 500 degrees C had the highest activity of propene
   production and therefore, the highest surface acidity, because of the
   good accessibility of the surface acid sites. The tungsten oxide
   catalyst supported on it also presented the highest conversion in the
   above reaction, although in this case acetone and diisopropyl ether were
   also obtained. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Triple helix formation of procollagen after the assembly of three
   alpha-chains at the C-propeptide is a prerequisite for refined
   structures such as fibers and meshworks. Hsp47 is an ER-resident stress
   inducible glycoprotein that specifically and transiently binds to newly
   synthesized procollagens. However, the real function of Hsp47 in
   collagen biosynthesis has not been elucidated in vitro or in vivo. Here,
   we describe the establishment of Hsp47 knockout mice that are severely
   deficient in the mature, propeptide-processed form of alpha 1(I)
   collagen and fibril structures in mesenchymal tissues. The molecular
   form of type IV collagen was also affected, and basement membranes were
   discontinuously disrupted in the homozygotes. The homozygous mice did
   not survive beyond 11.5 days postcoitus (dpc), and displayed abnormally
   orientated epithelial tissues and ruptured blood vessels. When triple
   helix formation of type I collagen secreted from cultured cells was
   monitored by protease digestion, the collagens of Hsp47+/+ and Hsp47+/-
   cells were resistant, but those of Hsp47-/- cells were sensitive. These
   results indicate for the first time that type I collagen is unable to
   form a rigid triple-helical structure without the assistance of
   molecular chaperone Hsp47, and that mice require Hsp47 for normal
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Ponderosa pine is one of the most sensitive species to ozone and a
   dominant species in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. To assess the factors
   controlling atone deposition to the forest and to study the forest
   response, we established a research site in a ponderosa pine plantation
   similar to 75 km northeast of Sacramento. Ozone concentration and ozone
   flux, along with relevant environmental variables, were measured from
   June to September in 1997 and from May to November in 1998. Summer of
   1997 had very low soil moisture and an early budbreak, while summer of
   1998 had very high soil moisture and later budbreak. Soil moisture and
   vapor pressure deficit exerted a strong control on ozone deposition in
   the dry year(1997), but the relationship was less clear in the wet
   year(1998). During the dry year ozone concentration and flux became
   decoupled owing to stomatal closure, but this did not occur explicitly
   in 1998. Phenology also proved to be important in controlling ozone
   deposition. Early in summer 1997 cumulative ozone flux was 50\% higher
   than that of 1998: the difference can be attributed to the late budbreak
   in 1998. Further, the highest ozone deposition velocity in both years
   occurred 3-4 weeks after budbreak. Total cumulative ozone flux during
   the summer was 6\% lower in 1998 due mainly to later budbreak even
   though drought stress reduced ozone flux late in summer 1997. Our
   results show that interannual climate variability impacts temporal
   patterns, physiological controls, and magnitude of ozone deposition to
   sensitive Mediterranean-type ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To assess the impact of the NHS breast screening programme on
   mortality from breast cancer in women aged 55-69 years over the period
   1990-8.
   Design Age cohort model with data for 1971-89 used to predict mortality
   for 1990-8 with assumption of no major effect from screening or
   improvements in treatment until after 1989. Effect of screening and
   other factors on mortality estimated by comparing three year moving
   averages of observed mortality with those predicted (by five year age
   groups from 50-54 to 75-79), the effect of screening being restricted to
   certain age groups.
   Setting England and Wales.
   Subjects Women aged 40 to 79 years.
   Results Compared with predicted mortality in the absence of screening or
   other effects the total reduction in mortality from breast cancer in
   1998 in women aged 55-69 was estimated as 21.3\%. Direct effect of
   screening was estimated as 6.4\% (range of estimates from 5.4-11.8\%).
   Effect of all other factors (improved treatment with tamoxifen and
   chemotherapy, and earlier presentation outside the screening programme)
   was estimated as 14.9\% (range 12.2-14.9\%).
   Conclusions By 1998 both screening and other factors, including
   improvements in treatment, had resulted in substantial reductions in
   mortality from breast cancer. Many deaths in the 1990s will be of women
   diagnosed in the 1980s and early 1990s, before invitation to screening.
   Further major effects from screening and treatment are expected, which
   together with cohort effects should result in further substantial
   reductions in mortality from breast cancer, particularly for women aged
   55-69, over die next 10 years.}},

   multiforme. Amongst the known etiological hypotheses is alteration of
   the immune system secondary to chemotherapy We seek new hypotheses
   relating this rare association. With better understanding of the causes
   provoking the appearance of these tumors new strategies could be
   designed for treatment Clinical case. A 26 year old man who was in a
   second complete remission of a nodular sclerosis type of Hodgkin's
   disease complained of headache and evening fever. Magnetic resonance
   showed a right frontal 6x5x4 cm cystic lesion with a vascular solid
   zone, with irregular margins and surrounded by vasogenic oedema. On
   investigation there were reduced levels of immunoglobulins G (522
   mg/dl)) and M (38 mg/dl). The lesion was removed surgically and
   histological studies confirmed the diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme.
   Conclusions. Although immunosuppression may contribute to the appearance
   of secondary neoplasia, it is not the only hypothesis in the case of
   glioblastoma multiforme occurring in a patient with Hodgkin's disease.
   In the literature similar cases, both isolated and familial, have been
   reported and may have been affected by genetic or environmental factors

Abstract = {{We have used a three-dimensional stratospheric model to investigate
   Arctic ozone depletion in the three winters from 1995/1996 to 1997/1998,
   winters with quite different dynamical conditions. We have diagnosed the
   chemical depletion from the model and compared the model ozone with
   ground-based and sonde measurements. In winter 1997/1998 the lower
   stratosphere was generally much warmer than the previous two cold
   winters. However, the occurrence of low temperatures in December 1997
   did cause chlorine activation and ozone loss in the model. In fact,
   despite the very different meteorological conditions for these three
   winters, by mid-February the model-calculated mean vortex loss was
   similar in each year at around 20\% at 480 Ii. Larger differences in the
   calculated loss occurred when low temperatures persisted into March,
   this seems a prerequisite for very large loss. By late March the
   model-calculated mean vortex column loss was 53 Dobson units (DU) in
   1998, 71 DU in 1996, and 80 DU in 1997. A first effort at a detailed
   day-to-day validation of a chemical transport model by comparison with
   ozone measurements is presented. The model reproduces the mean column
   observations to within about +/-10\%, although the bias varies in
   magnitude and changes sign in different years. The agreement between the
   model and ozonesonde profiles in the lower stratosphere varies from year
   to year and during the course of a particular winter/spring. In winter
   1997/1998, the model agrees well with sonde profiles at the 480 K and
   555 It levels with a positive mean difference (ozonesonde values minus
   model values) with amplitude of less than 6\%. In contrast, in winter
   1996/1997, the mean difference is negative and the amplitude is less
   than 15\%. In winter 1995/1996 the mean difference is negative and the
   amplitude reaches 43\%. The differences in 1995/1996 and 1996/1997
   result despite good agreement between model and observations in
   midwinter, and they develop following the large chemical losses which
   occurred in those winters. We suggest that a major contribution to the
   model/observation differences for those two winters is a model
   underestimation of the chemical ozone loss.}},

Abstract = {{The complete amino acid sequence of Japanese chestnut (Castanea crenata
   Sieb, et Zucc.) agglutinin (CCA) was determined. Analysis by SIMS of the
   acidic peptide obtained by pepsin digestion revealed that the N-terminal
   amino acid sequence should be Acetyl-Met-Glu-Glu. Prior to sequence
   analysis, redetermination of cysteine residues indicated the presence of
   one cysteine residue per subunit, The complete sequence was determined
   by endoproteinase Arg-C and Achromobacter protease I digestion, and CNBr
   cleavage. CCA consists of 309 amino acid residues with a high content of
   glycine (16.5 mol\%) and one cysteine residue, The calculated molecular
   mass was 33,387 Da including the N-terminal acetyl group. C-terminal
   sequence analysis of intact CCA gave only one sequence, HMEYF,
   indicating that no heterogeneous CCA formed by posttranslational
   cleavage at the C-terminal region, as occurs in some legume lectins,
   Analysis of the sequence of CCA itself revealed that CCA could be
   divided into two structural domains, the N-domain and the C-domain,
   almost at the center. These domains share about 35\% identical residues,
   so CCA has a repeat sequence. Also, both domains show a homology to
   jacalin-related lectins with 27-38\% identity, These results suggest
   that the structure of CCA resembles two molecules of jacalin-related
   lectin. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The Ca2+-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) protein causes stimulation

   investigated the consequence of CAML overexpression on Ca2+ signaling
   using rapid confocal imaging of Fluo3-loaded NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Control
   and CAML-expressing cells gave concentration-dependent responses to the
   Ca2+ mobilizing agonist ATP. CAML expression reduced the sensitivity of
   the cells so that higher concentrations of ATP were needed to achieve
   global Ca2+ waves. The amplitudes of Ca2+ waves were significantly
   reduced in CAML expressing cells, consistent with earlier suggestions
   that CAML causes depletion of internal Ca2+ stores. With low ATP
   concentrations, only local Ca2+ release events were observed. CAML did
   not affect the characteristics of these local Ca2+ signals, suggesting
   that it does not directly affect Ca2+ release channels. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Regucalcin was discovered in 1978 as a Ca(2+)-binding protein that does
   not contain EF-hand motif of Ca(2+)- binding domain {[}Yamaguchi, M.,
   and Yamamoto T., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 26, 1915-1918, 1978]. The name
   regucalcin was proposed for this Ca(2+)-binding protein, which can
   regulate liver cell functions related to Ca(2+). Regucalcin has been
   demonstrated to play a multifunctional role in liver and kidney cells,
   for which regucalcin mRNA expression and its protein content are
   pronounced. Hepatic regucalcin mRNA expression has been shown to be
   mediated through signaling pathway of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent
   protein kinase, protein kinase C, and tyrosine kinase. AP-1- and
   NF-1-like factors can bind to the promotor region of the rat regucalcin
   gene to mediate the Ca(2+) response for transcriptional activation.
   Growing evidence supports the view, moreover, that regucalcin plays an
   important role in the regulation of Ca(2+) signaling from the cytoplasm
   to nuclei in the proliferative cells of regenerating rat liver. Also,
   regucalcin has been demonstrated to be transported to liver nucleus, and
   it can inhibit nuclear protein kinase, protein phosphatase, and DNA and
   RNA synthesis in regenerating liver. Regucalcin plays a physiologic role
   in the control for overexpression of proliferative cells. Regucalcin has
   been proposed to be an important regulatory protein in nuclear signaling
   system. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Endogenous steroids and numerous environmental agents have potent
   effects on mammary development and carcinogenesis. Locally produced
   cytochrome P450 enzymes that modify such molecules are therefore likely
   to be important regulators of these processes. Here we describe the
   characterization of a novel mouse gene, termed Cyp2d22, that is highly
   expressed in the mammary tumor derived cell line RIIII/ Prl. Cyp2d22 is
   expressed at intermediate levels in the weakly tumorigenic cell line
   RIII/MG, whereas expression is low or absent in all normal mouse mammary
   epithelial cell lines tested and three C3H mammary tumor derived cell
   lines. Immunoblot analysis of mouse tissues with highly specific
   antisera indicates that 2D22 protein levels are most abundant in liver,
   while intermediate levels of expression are seen in adrenal, ovary, and
   mammary gland. Immunohistochemical staining of liver sections with these
   antisera demonstrates that 2D22 is most abundant in the first layer or
   two of parenchymal cells surrounding the central vein, with virtually no
   expression detected in periportal cells. Interestingly, sequence
   similarity and functional data suggest that Cyp2d22 may be the mouse
   ortholog of human CYP2D6. These observations support the hypothesis that
   2D22 mediates a distinct, biologically significant activity in relation
   to other mouse 2D family members. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The anesthetic propofol (PPF) has been shown to be an antioxidant in
   acellular experiments. This study was designed to assess the ability of
   PPF to protect primary-cultured brain cells against iron-mediated
   toxicity. A comparison with trolox (TX), a hydrosoluble vitamin E
   analogue, was performed. Rat cortical cells were exposed to 10 mu M
   FeSO4. PPF and/or TX. After a 4-h incubation, PPF and TX improved cell
   survival (lactate dehydrogenase measurements) in a
   concentration-dependent manner. The respective EC50s of each substance
   were 4 and 4.6 mu M. The maximal effect was obtained at a 25-mu M
   concentration which is similar to concentrations of PPF used clinically.
   The combination of both drugs at certain concentrations showed a
   complete protection of the cells, a significant decrease in
   intracellular peroxide production (dichloro-fluorescein diacetate
   (DCF-DA) fluorescence, 4-h incubation), in lipoperoxidation
   (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances fluorescence, PPF 6.25 mu M +
   TX 12.5 mu M) and an additive protective effect. This was true after 4-
   and 16-h incubation. These data suggest that PPF is neuroprotective.
   Moreover, the combination with a vitamin E analogue confers long
   duration protection against oxidative stress. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a natural product
   occurring in grapes and various other plants with medicinal properties.
   The phenolic antioxidant has been identified as a potential cancer
   chemopreventative agent and its presence in red wine has been suggested
   to be linked to the low incidence of heart disease in some regions of
   France. Recently, however, resveratrol was reported to promote DNA
   fragmentation in the presence of copper ions (K. Fukuhara and N. Miyata,
   1998, Bioorg. Med Chem. Lett. 8, 3187-3192), prompting us to investigate
   this phenomenon in mechanistic detail. By acting as a reducing agent,
   resveratrol was found to promote hydroxyl-radical ('OH) formation by
   DNA-bound Cu(II) ions. However, in the presence of either ascorbic acid
   or glutathione (i.e., under more physiological conditions), the phenolic
   lost this property and behaved as an antioxidant. In the ascorbate
   system, resveratrol had no effect on the rate of `OH formation, but
   protected DNA from damage by acting as a radical-scavenging antioxidant.
   In contrast, in the glutathione system, resveratrol inhibited `OH
   formation via a novel mechanism involving the inhibition of glutathione
   disulfide formation. We have concluded, therefore, that the DNA-damaging
   properties of resveratrol, identified recently by Fukuhara and Miyata,
   will hie of no significance under physiological conditions. To the
   contrary, we have demonstrated that the phenolic behaves as a powerful
   antioxidant, both via classical, hydroxyl-radical scavenging and via a
   novel, glutathione-sparing mechanism. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{In mitochondria, the hydrolytic activity of ATP synthase is regulated by
   a natural inhibitor protein, IF1. The binding of IF1 to ATP synthase
   depends on pH values, and below neutrality, IF1 forms a stable complex
   with the enzyme. Bovine IF1 has two oligomeric states, dimer and
   tetramer, depending on pH values. At pH 6.5, where it is active, IF1
   dimerizes by formation of an antiparallel alpha-helical coiled-coil in
   its C-terminal region. This arrangement places the inhibitory N-terminal
   regions in opposition, implying that active dimeric IF1 can bind two F-1
   domains simultaneously. Evidence of dimerization of F-1-ATPase by
   binding to IF1 is provided by gel filtration chromatography, analytical
   ultracentrifugation, and electron microscopy. At present, it is not
   known whether IF1 can bring about the dimerization of the F1F0-ATPase

Abstract = {{Purpose: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)failure within 2 years after
   radical prostatectomy (RP) has been shown to be a clinically significant
   predictor of distant failure. This study was performed to estimate
   2-year PSA failure rates on the basis of readily available clinical and
   pathologic factors to identify patients for whom effective adjuvant
   systemic therapy is needed.
   Patients and Methods: A Cox regression multivariable analysis was used
   to determine whether the percentage of positive prostate biopsies, PSA
   level, and the pathologic findings at RP in 1,728 men provided
   clinically relevant information about PSA outcome after RP, A
   bootstrapping technique with 2,000 replications was used to provide 95\%
   confidence intervals for the predicted 2-year PSA failure rates, which
   were determined on the basis of the independent clinical and pathologic
   predictors of PSA outcome.
   Results: The independent predictors of time to PSA failure included a
   percentage of positive prostate biopsies of greater than 34\% (P less
   than or equal to .009), PSA level greater than 10 ng/mL (P less than or
   equal to .01), seminal vesicle invasion (P = .02), prostatectomy Gleason
   score of 8 to 10 (P = .04), and positive surgical margins (P = .0001).
   Predictions of 2-year PSA failure rates and bootstrap estimates of the
   95\% confidence intervals ware arranged in a tabular format, stratified
   by independent clinical and pathologic predictors of PSA outcome.
   Conclusion: Patients who are most likely to benefit from effective
   adjuvant systemic therapy after RP can be identified using readily
   available clinical and pathologic data. (C) 2000 by American Society of

Abstract = {{The developmental program of cell-type switching of S. pombe requires a

   termination at the mat1-proximal polar-terminator of replication (RTS1).
   A genetic screen to identify termination factors identified an allele

Abstract = {{The cooperative antitumor effects of IL-12 and IL-15 gene transfer were
   studied in the N592 MHC class I-negative small cell lung cancer cell
   line xenotransplanted in nude mice. N592 cells engineered to secrete
   IL-15 displayed a significantly reduced tumor growth kinetics, and a
   slightly reduced tumor take rate, while N592 engineered with IL-12
   displayed only minor changes in their growth in nude mice. However, N592
   cells producing both cytokines were completely rejected, and produced a
   potent local bystander effect, inducing rejection of coinjected
   wild-type tumor cells. N592/IL-12/IL-15 cells were completely and
   promptly rejected also in NK-depleted nude mice, while in
   granulocyte-depleted animals a slight delay in the rejection process was
   observed. Immunohistochemical analyses of the N592/IL-12/IL-15 tumor
   area in intact nude mice revealed the presence of infiltrating
   macrophages, granulocytes, and NK cells, and expression of inducible NO
   synthase and of secondary cytokines such as IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and
   IFN-gamma, and at higher levels GM-CSF, macrophage-inflammatory
   protein-2, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. In NK cell-depleted
   nude mice, numerous macrophages and granulocytes infiltrated the tumor,
   and a strong expression of macrophage-inflammatory protein-2 and
   inducible NO synthase was also observed. Finally, macrophages cocultured
   with N592/IL-12/IL-15 produced NO in vitro, and inhibited tumor cell
   growth, further suggesting their role as effector cells in this model.}},

Abstract = {{The translocation of chromosome 11, long arm, region 2, band 1, to
   chromosome 18, long arm, region 2, band 1 (t(11;18)(q21;q21)) represents
   a recurrent chromosomal abnormality in extranodal marginal zone B-cell
   lymphoma (MZBCL) of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type and
   leads to a fusion of the apoptosis inhibitor-2 (API2) gene on chromosome
   11 and the MALT lymphoma-associated translocation (MLT) gene on
   chromosome 18. A 2-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
   assay, which can be used for the detection of t(11;18) in interphase
   nuclei and metaphase chromosomes on fresh and archival tumor tissue, was
   developed. The P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) clone located immediately
   telomeric to the MLT gene and the PAC clone spanning the API2 gene were
   differentially labeled and used to visualize the derivative chromosome
   II resulting from t(11;18), as evident by the overlapping or juxtaposed
   red and green fluorescent signals. The assay was applied to interphase
   nuclei of 20 cases with nonmalignant conditions and 122 B-cell
   non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), The latter group comprised 20 cases of
   nodal follicle center cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell NHL, 10
   cases of gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 10 cases of hairy cell
   leukemia, and 82 cases of MZBCL (41 extranodal from various locations,
   19 nodal, and 22 splenic MZBCL) including 35 cases with an abnormal
   karyotype, 2 of which revealed t(11;18). By interphase FISH, t(11;18)
   was detected in 8 gastrointestinal low-grade MALT-type lymphomas
   including the 2 cytogenetically t(11;18)(+) cases. In the 8 t(11;18)(+)
   cases, the FISH results were confirmed by reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using API2 and MLT
   specific primers. Our results indicate that t(11;18)(q21;q21)
   specifically characterizes a subgroup of low grade MZBCL of the
   MALT-type and that the FISH assay described here is a highly specific
   and rapid test for the detection of this translocation. (Blood,

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{Omi is a human serine protease whose catalytic domain is homologous to a
   bacterial heat shock endoprotease (HtrA), a protein indispensable to the
   survival of bacteria at elevated temperatures. Omi is expressed
   ubiquitously, and its protein product is predominantly localized in the
   endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells. Here we present the genomic
   structure of Omi, consisting of eight exons located on human chromosome
   2p12-p13. Furthermore, we describe an alternatively splice form of Omi
   (D-Omi) that is expressed predominantly in the kidney, colon, and
   thyroid. D-Omi lacks peptide sequence encoded by two exons (exons III
   and VII). The absence of exon VII leads to a protein with a modified PDZ
   domain unable to interact with a known partner, the Mxi2 protein. The
   absence of exon III affects the catalytic domain and leads to a protein
   with no detectable protease activity. Our studies suggest that D-Omi may
   have a unique role in the normal function of kidney, colon, and thyroid.

Abstract = {{Twelve medium to long chain fatty acid Esters (Esters), the total number
   of carbon atoms of which ranged from 17 to 34, were used to study the
   effect of the vehicle on the permeation of ketoprofen, and the effect
   was compared with the case of indomethacin. The solubility of ketoprofen
   was higher in Esters with a smaller number of carbon atoms. The
   permeation rate of ketoprofen from the Ester suspension through excised
   hairless rat skin was proportional to its solubility in the suspension,
   which was the same in the case of indomethacin. The diffusion constant
   and partition coefficient were calculated using the computer program
   MULTI(FILT). The diffusion constant decreased with increasing number of
   carbon atoms: and the partition coefficient was increased with
   increasing number of carbon atoms, in both cases of ketoprofen and
   indomethacin. Esters also penetrated the skin with the concentration of
   about 10 mg/g, independent of the number of carbon atoms. The Esters in
   the skin increase the diffusion rate of the drugs, especially in the
   case of Esters with a small number of carbon atoms. Also the drug
   solubility in the skin was improved, although the effect was similar for
   the range of Esters investigated in the present study. Then the
   permeation rate of ketoprofen and indomethacin increased. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The molecular simulations have been performed on the permeation of pure
   and mixed-gases across carbon membranes with three different pore
   shapes: the diamond path (DP), zigzag path (ZP) and straight path (SP),
   composed of micro-graphite crystallites. The smallest pore width of the
   membranes was set at 0.5 nm and the methane and ethane, whose molecular
   size in the shortest diameter is approximately 0.37-0.38 nm, were chosen
   as permeating gases. The density profiles of methane and ethane showed
   that the permeation resistance inside the DP and ZP membranes was
   significant while the resistance of the SP membrane was localized at the
   membrane exit. In the case of mixed-gas permeation, the
   permselectivities of ethane to methane were larger than the ideal
   separation factors for the three membranes due to the competitive
   adsorption of ethane which was a strongly adsorbed component. However,
   the permselectivities were smaller than the adsorption equilibrium
   separation factors since the higher permeation resistance of ethane
   played a role of counteraction. It is therefore suggested that two
   factors, selective adsorptions and permeation resistances, should be
   considered for a rational design of membranes suitable for the
   separation of specified species in gas mixtures. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Protease inhibitors were used to test the hypothesis that caspases and
   other proteases were active during apoptosis in cultured porcine
   granulosa cells. Cells isolated from 3 to 6 mm follicles were cultured
   for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium: Hams F12 (1:1')
   containing 1\% fetal bovine serum. Final inhibitor concentrations, added
   in 10 muL of dimethylsulfoxide, were 0, 1, 5, 25 and 125 muM. Cells with
   compromised plasma membrane integrity, identified by uptake ethidium
   homodimer, increased during culture in the absence of inhibitors from
   37\% to 43\%.'Apoptotic (A(o)) cells, identified by DNA fluorescence
   flow cytometry, increased (P < 0.05) from 1.7\% to 29\%. The serine
   protease inhibitor N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) at
   125 <mu>M was lethal increasing (P < 0.05) cells with compromised
   membranes to 92\%. In response to TPCK, A(o) cells decreased from 55\%
   to 1.2\%; progesterone and estradiol production were decreased by 94\%
   and 98\%, respectively. The general casp ase inhibitor,
   benzyloxycarbonyl-valinyl-alaninyl-aspartyl fluoro methylketone,
   decreased (P < 0.05) A(o) cells linearly from 33\% to 3\% between 0 and
   125 muM without significant effect on steroidogenesis or on the
   percentage of cells with compromised plasma membranes. Other inhibitors
   only had a marginal effect on apoptosis; concentrations of greater than
   or equal to1 muM decreased (P < 0.05) A(o) cells from 29\% to 18\% to
   21\% and had no significant effect on membrane integrity or steroid
   production. We conclude that caspases are associated with apoptosis in

Abstract = {{Syncollin is a 13-kDa protein associated with the membranes of
   pancreatic zymogen granules. Here we determine the in situ localization
   of syncollin in pancreatic acinar cells from adult and neonatal rats,
   and study the targeting of green fluorescent protein(GFP-) and
   His(6)-tagged syncollin chimaeras in model exocrine and endocrine
   secretory cells. Immunocytochemical analysis of the distribution of
   syncollin in fully differentiated and neonatal acinar cells revealed a
   granular pattern that corresponded with that of the zymogen-granule
   markers synaptobrevin 2 and amylase. In fully differentiated acinar
   cells syncollin-positive vesicles were detected in the apical region of
   the cells, whereas in neonatal acinar cells they were found clustered
   near the cell nucleus. Both GFP- and His(6)-tagged syncollin entered the
   secretory pathway when transiently expressed in AR42J or AtT-20 cells.
   Syncollin-GFP was found predominantly in amylase- positive granules in
   AR42J cells and in adrenocorticotrophic hormone- (ACTH-) positive
   granules in AtT-20 cells. Syncollin-GFP was also present in the Golgi
   complex in AR42J cells. Syncollin-His(6) became localized in
   ACTH-containing granules in the neuritic processes of AtT-20 cells. In
   AR42J cells syncollin-His(6) did not co-localize with amylase, but was
   detected in acidic vesicles. These results show that the exocrine
   protein syncollin contains intrinsic cell-type-independent targeting
   information that is retained in both exocrine and endocrine cells after
   fusion to the GFP tag. In contrast, His(6)-tagged syncollin is
   efficiently targeted to secretory granules only in AtT-20 cells and not
   in AR42J cells.}},

Abstract = {{Electroviscous effects and streaming potentials were measured for
   various track-etched ultrafiltration and microfiltration membranes at a
   number of salt concentrations, using both LiCl and KCl electrolytes. A
   calculation program was developed that calculates zeta potentials from
   this experimental data, using electrokinetic flow theory and a numerical
   solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation.
   It was demonstrated, both experimentally and by calculation, that the
   electroviscous effect for negatively charged membranes is larger when
   employing LiCl solutions than when employing KCl solutions. This effect
   is absent for positively charged membranes and can thus be used for
   determination of the sign of the membrane charge.
   It was found that zeta potentials calculated from electroviscosity data
   were al ways higher than those calculated from streaming potential data.
   This indicates that the electrokinetic theory underpredicts the
   electroviscous effect; It was also found that at low salt concentrations
   and small pore sizes (kappa r(p) < 1.5) it was not possible to calculate
   the zeta potential from streaming potential or electroviscous effect.
   This may be caused by the fact that some assumptions made in
   electrokinetic flow theory lose their validity under these conditions.

Title = {{Prospective analysis of the value of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure

Journal = {{TRANSPLANTATION}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{819-827}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background. No prospective study has been performed to determine the
   prognostic value of 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure (24-hr ABP) versus
   casual blood pressure (CBP) in patients after kidney transplantation. We
   have addressed this issue by analyzing renal graft function in patients
   for the first 5 years after transplantation.
   Methods. The 24-hr ABP (SpaceLabs 90207) was monitored 6 and 18 months
   after transplantation in 46 renal transplant recipients without any
   acute episodes of rejection. Combined study endpoints were death of
   patients, need for dialysis, second transplantation, and doubling of
   serum creatinine,
   Results. Six months after transplantation systolic and diastolic 24-hr
   ABP correlated with serum creatinine (r=0.41, P=0.005 and r=0.37,
   P<0.01, respectively) although CBP did not. Divided into tertiles
   according to average 24-hr ABP (lower tertile: less than or equal to 91
   mmHg; middle tertile: 92-97 mnHg; upper tertile: greater than or equal
   to 98 mmHg) serum creatinine significantly differed between the three
   groups (1.26+/-0.38 vs. 1.32+/-0.25 vs. 1.65+/-0.39 mg/dl, respectively;
   analysis of variance, P<0.01). Confounding factors of renal function
   such as age, body weight, cold and warm ischemic time, cytomegaly virus
   status, methylprednisone and cyclosporine dosages, cyclosporine
   concentrations, as well as concomitant antihypertensive medication did
   not differ among the three groups. In the long-term follow-up (5 years),
   combined endpoints were reached in 3 of 15 of the lower tertile group,
   in 3 of 15 of the median tertile group, and in 8 of 16 of the upper
   tertile group (log-rank test, P<0.01), No relation to long-term outcome
   was found when patients were stratified according to their CBP.
   Conclusion. In our small but homogenous study cohort 24-hr ABP was more
   closely related to renal function in patients after transplantation than
   CBP suggesting that 24-hr ABP is superior for evaluation of
   hypertension-related renal graft dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{Although the collisional belt between the North and South China blocks
   has been well defined in China, the location of its eastward extension
   in the Korean Peninsula is highly controversial. The Cambro-Ordovician
   sedimentary rucks in South Korea, the Joseon Supergroup, accumulated in
   the Ogcheon belt which has been proposed as the suture zone between the
   North and South China blocks or the block boundary. The Joseon
   Supergroup comprises five different lithostratigraphic units, and may be
   divided into two tectonic blocks by the Honam Shear Zone (HSZ) in the
   Ogcheon belt. Based on the affinities of the Cambrian trilobite faunas,
   previous studies correlated the Yeongweol unit in the western part of
   the HSZ with South China and the Duwibong unit in the eastern part of
   the HSZ with North China. To test the above geodynamic interpretation,
   this study analyzed and compared the degree of the provinciality of
   Upper Cambrian conodonts from the Yeongweol and Duwibong units and North
   and South China. The quantitative test for the Upper Cambrian
   provincialism shows high bioprovincial affinities between the Yeongweol
   and Duwibong units and both conodont faunas from the two units display
   higher bioprovincial affinities with that of North China rather than
   with that of South China. Their high conodont faunal similarity suggests
   that the Korean Peninsula might have been included in a larger
   continental block including the North China and the Korean Peninsula,
   the Sino-Korean block, in early Paleozoic time. This result is supported
   by recent studies on lower Paleozoic biogeography, stratigraphy and
   sedimentology that suggest that the Yeongweol unit of the Joseon
   Supergroup is more closely correlated with North China than with South
   China. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   genes and for allelic hypermethylation of the p16(INK4a) gene. DNA was
   isolated from sputum and bilateral bronchial lavage, and brushings were
   taken at bronchoscopy.
   Results: Forty-one genetic lesions were detected within exfoliative
   material from the group of 51 patients with lung cancer and 10 lesions
   in the chronic smoker group. K-ras mutations occurred exclusively in the
   lung cancer group, whereas p53 mutations and p16(INK4a) promoter
   hypermethylation were also found in chronic smokers. Three of eight
   chronic smokers who harbored an (epi)genetic alteration were
   subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer. Analysis of sputum yielded
   information equivalent to that of samples obtained during bronchoscopy.
   Conclusion: p16(INK4a) promoter hypermethylation and p53 mutations can
   occur in chronic smokers before any clinical evidence of neoplasia and
   may be indicative of an increased risk of developing lung cancer or of
   early disease. K-ras mutations occur exclusively in the presence of
   clinically detectable neoplastic transformation. Molecular analysis of
   sputum for such markers may provide an effective means of screening
   chronic smokers to enable earlier detection and therapeutic intervention
   of lung cancer. (C) 2000 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.}},

Abstract = {{Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary human brain tumor,
   and it is, for all practical purposes, incurable in adult patients, The
   high mortality rates reflect the fact that glioblastomas are resistant
   to adjuvant therapies (radiation and chemicals), the mode of action of
   which is cytotoxic, We show here that an p.o.-active small molecule
   kinase inhibitor of the 2-phenylaminopyrimidine class may have
   therapeutic potential for glioblastomas. STI571 inhibits the growth of
   U343 and U87 human glioblastoma cells that have been injected into the
   brains of nude mice, but it does not inhibit intracranial growth of
   ras-transformed cells, Studies on a broad panel of genetically validated
   human and animal cell lines show that STI571 acts by disruption of the
   ligand:receptor autocrine loops for platelet-derived growth factor that
   are a pervasive feature of malignant astrocytoma. The cellular response
   of glioblastoma cells to STI571 does not appear to involve an apoptotic
   mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Amphiphilic diblock and triblock copolymers of various block
   compositions based on hydrophilic poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOz) and
   hydrophobic poly(epsilon-caprolactone) were synthesized. The micelle
   formation of these block copolymers in aqueous media was confirmed by a
   fluorescence technique and dynamic light scattering. The critical
   micelle concentrations ranged from 35.5 to 4.6 mg/L for diblock
   copolymers and 4.7 to 9.0 mg/L for triblock copolymers, depending on the
   block composition. The phase-transition behaviors of the block
   copolymers in concentrated aqueous solutions were investigated. When the
   temperature was increased, aqueous solutions of diblock and triblock
   copolymers exhibited gel-sol transition and precipitation, both of which
   were thermally reversible. The gel-sol transition- and precipitation
   temperatures were manipulated by adjustment of the block composition. As
   the hydrophobic portion of block, copolymers became higher, a larger gel
   region was generated. In the presence of sodium chloride, the phase
   transitions were shifted to a lower temperature level. Sodium
   thiocyanate displaced the gel region and precipitation temperatures to a
   higher temperature level. The low molecular weight saccharides, such as
   glucose and maltose, contributed to the shift of phase-transition
   temperatures to a lower temperature level, where glucose was more
   effective than maltose in lowering the gel-sol transition temperatures.
   The malonic acid that formed hydrogen bonds with the PEtOz shell of
   micelles was effective in lowering phase-transition temperatures to
   1.0M, above which concentration the block copolymer solutions formed
   complex precipitates. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Title = {{Brane world cosmology: Gauge-invariant formalism for perturbation}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{In the present paper the gauge-invariant formalism is developed for
   perturbations of the brane world model in which our universe is realized
   as a boundary of a higher dimensional spacetime. For the background
   model in which the bulk spacetime is (n + m) dimensional and has the
   spatial symmetry corresponding to the isometry group of an n-dimensional
   maximally symmetric space, gauge-invariant equations are derived for
   perturbations of the bulk space-time. Further, for the case
   corresponding to the brane world model in which m = 2 and the brane is a
   boundary invariant under the spatial symmetry in the unperturbed
   background, relations between the gauge-invariant variables describing
   the bulk perturbations and those for brane perturbations are derived
   from Israel's junction condition under the assumption of Z(2) symmetry.
   In particular, for the case in which the bulk spacetime is a
   constant-curvature spacetime, it is shown that the bulk perturbation
   equations reduce to a single hyperbolic master equation for a master
   variable, and that the physical condition on the gauge-invariant
   variable describing the intrinsic stress perturbation of the brane
   yields a boundary condition for the master equation through the junction
   condition. On the basis of this formalism, it is pointed out that it
   seems to be difficult to suppress brane perturbations corresponding to
   massive excitations for a brane motion giving a realistic expanding
   universe model.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of molecular weight distributions (MWDs) with monomer
   conversion in the catalytic chain transfer (CCT) polymerization of
   methyl methacrylate at 60 degrees C is investigated by simulation (via

   is used as the precursor for the CCT agent, which is formed in situ by
   initiator-derived (2,2' -azobisisobutyronitrile) radicals to yield the
   catalytically active Co(II) species. The small shifts seen in the MWD
   toward lower molecular weights with increasing monomer conversion are
   shown to be of the same order of magnitude as the associated changes in
   the Nn;VD in non-CCT controlled free-radical polymerization, indicating
   that no significant change in the MWD with monomer conversion is
   associated with the CCT process. These results are compared to the
   evolution of MWDs in conventional chain transfer polymerizations with
   thiols as transfer agents. A clear shift toward higher molecular weights
   is seen with increasing monomer conversion, indicating disparate rates
   of thiol and monomer consumption. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We present results of experimental studies on the formation of gas
   hydrates (clathrates) at conditions of geophysical interest. Clathrate
   hydrates formed by a reaction of gas at ice Ih surfaces are always found
   to be mesoporous to macroporous with pores sizes between 100 to 400 nm
   and pore volumes of approximately 25-40\% for CH4, Ar and Nz hydrate,
   and smaller pores of 20 to 100 nm with a porosity of approximately
   10-20\% for CO2 hydrate. The three-dimensional sponge-like
   microstructure occurs in single crystalline grains of typically a few mu
   m size and was observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy.
   It forms over a wide range of p-T conditions below the ice Ih melting.
   The porous microstructure is stable for at least several months, even
   close to the clathrate decomposition, and is proposed to be formed by
   local differences in the energy balance between hydrate formation and
   ice decompositon. The results presented are considered of potential

Abstract = {{The attraction, binding, and entry of monocytes into the vessel wall
   play an important role in atherogenesis. We have previously shown that
   minimally oxidized/modified LDL (MM-LDL), a pathogenically relevant
   lipoprotein, can activate human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) to
   produce monocyte chemotactic activators. In the present study, we
   demonstrate th at MM-LDL and oxidation products of
   1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC) activate
   endothelial cells to synthesize monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1)
   and interleukin-8 (IL-8). Several lines of evidence suggest that this
   activation is mediated by the lipid-dependent transcription factor
   peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha), the most
   abundant member of the PPAR family in HAECs. Treatment of transfected
   CV-1 cells demonstrated activation of the PPAR alpha ligand-binding
   domain by MM-LDL, Ox-PAPC, or its component phospholipids,
   1-palmitoyl-2-oxovalaroyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine and
   1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine; these lipids also
   activated a consensus peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
   response element (PPRE) in transfected HAECs. Furthermore, activation of
   PPAR alpha with synthetic ligand Wy14,643 stimulates the synthesis of
   IL-8 and MCP-1 by HAECs. By contrast, troglitazone, a PPAR gamma
   agonist, decreased the levels of IL-8 and MCP-1. Finally, we demonstrate
   that unlike wild-type endothelial cells, endothelial cells derived from
   PPARa null mice do not produce MCP-1/JE in response to Ox-PAPC and
   MM-LDL. Together, these data demonstrate a proinflammatory role for PPAR
   alpha in mediation of the activation of endothelial cells to produce
   monocyte chemotactic activity in response to oxidized phospholipids and
   lipoproteins.}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of the work was to develop a method for evaluating wind
   damage risk of the forest stands. The risk treated in the work
   represents relative ranking with values from 1 (the lowest risk) to 9
   (the highest risk). In general, the damage risk is divided into a
   permanent and a temporary damage risk. Defining permanent risk areas is
   based on the existence of factors that cannot be influenced by man (the
   character of the soil, terrain and all climatic factors). The temporary
   damage risk is based on the characteristics of vegetation. Input
   parameters for calculating the damage risk are the soil, the vegetation
   and the terrain. GIS-based data are used for calculating damage risk
   based on the soil and damage risk based on the forest stands,
   respectively. An airflow model, developed within the computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) programme FIDAP, is used for calculating terrain exposure
   classification (TEREX) which evaluates wind exposure of sites
   independently of current vegetation. Integrating TEREX with damage risk
   based on the soil yields permanent exposure classification (PERMEX),
   evaluating the risk of wind damage occurrence that cannot be influenced
   by man. A result of combining PERMEX with damage risk based on the
   forest stands is a complex regional wind damage risk classification
   (WINDARC) which represents current threat of forest stands from wind.

Abstract = {{On 6 January 1992 measurements of a mountain wave with significant
   amplitude were taken over the southern tip of Greenland during an ER-2
   flight at an altitude of about 20 km. This work focuses on 3D numerical
   simulations of the wave generation and its propagation into the
   stratosphere during this event. The sensitivity ni the simulated
   mountain wave to surface friction and horizontal resolution is explored.
   A nonhydrostatic model I used for experiments with horizontal
   resolutions of 12. 4. and 1.3 km.
   In all simulations the flow over the southern tip of Greenland generates
   a mountain wave. which propagates into the stratosphere. Changes of
   surface friction and horizontal resolution affect mostly the amplitude
   of the mountain wave. Increasing surface friction on the slopes reduces
   the amplitude of the excited orographic gravity wave. Horizontal
   diffusion required for numerical stability attenuates gravity waves
   during their propagation into the stratosphere Increasing the horizontal
   resolution permits a smaller diffusion and thereby results in larger
   stratospheric wave amplitudes.
   The experiment with increased surface friction at 1.3-km horizontal
   resolution shows the best agreement with the observational data of the
   wave in the stratosphere. The differences between the simulated and
   measured amplitudes of vertical displacement and temperature anomaly are
   less than about 20\%. The disparity in vertical velocity is larger:
   downward velocities were observed up to 3.8 m s(-1) and simulated up to
   2.7 m s(-1) In the experiments with lower surface friction at 4-km
   resolution, the accuracy regarding the amplitude of vertical
   displacement and temperature anomalies is similar, but the simulated
   maximum downdraft is even weaker. The experiment suggests with increased
   surface friction at 4-km resolution and normal friction at 12-km
   resolution;significantly underestimate the wave amplitude. The results
   of the experiments suggest that the generation of orographic gravity
   waves and their propagation into the stratosphere can be simulated in
   three dimensions in a realistic manner provided that the magnitude of
   the parameterized surface friction is in a realistic range and the
   horizontal reslution is sufficient.}},

Abstract = {{A bovine cartilage explant system was used to evaluate the effects of
   injurious compression on chondrocyte apoptosis and matrix biochemical
   and biomechanical properties within intact cartilage. Disks of newborn
   bovine articular cartilage were compressed in vitro to various peak
   stress levels and chondrocyte apoptotic cell death, tissue biomechanical
   properties, tissue swelling, glycosaminoglycan loss, and nitrite levels
   were quantified. Chondrocyte apoptosis occurred at peak stresses as low
   as 4.5 MPa and increased with peak stress in a dose-dependent manner.
   This increase in apoptosis was maximal by 24 h after the termination of
   the loading protocol. At high peak stresses (>20 MPa), greater than
   50\%, of cells apoptosed. When measured in uniaxial confined
   compression, the equilibrium and dynamic stiffness of explants decreased
   with the severity of injurious load, although this trend was not
   significant until 24-MPa peak stress, In contrast, the equilibrium and
   dynamic stiffness measured in radially unconfined compression decreased
   significantly after injurious stresses of 12 and 7 MPa, respectively.
   Together, these results suggested that injurious compression caused a
   degradation of the collagen fibril network in the 7- to 12-MPa range.
   Consistent with this hypothesis, injurious compression caused a
   dose-dependent increase in tissue swelling, significant by 13-MPa peak
   stress. Glycosaminoglycans were also released from the cartilage in a
   dose-dependent manner, significant by 6- to 13-MPa peak stress. Nitrite
   levels were significantly increased above controls at 20-MPa peak
   stress. Together, these data suggest that injurious compression can
   stimulate cell death as well as a range of biomechanical and biochemical
   alterations to the matrix and, possibly, chondrocyte nitric oxide
   expression. Interestingly, chondrocyte programmed cell death appears to
   take place at stresses lower than those required to stimulate cartilage
   matrix degradation and biomechanical changes. While chondrocyte
   apoptosis may therefore be one of the earliest responses to tissue
   injury, it is currently unclear whether this initial cellular response
   subsequently drives cartilage matrix degradation and changes in the
   biomechanical properties of the tissue. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{We report new accurate ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs) for

   are calculated by the configuration-selecting multi-reference
   configuration-interaction method employing the cc-pVTZ basis set. We
   diabatize the adiabatic potential energy data and investigate the
   nuclear dynamics on these coupled electronic states by a time-dependent
   wave packet method. First, we investigate the photodetachment spectrum
   of NO2- for a transition to the (A) over tilde B-2(2) State and compare
   our findings with the available experimental results. The agreement is
   very satisfactory. In addition, we examine the femtosecond decay of the
   (A) over tilde B-2(2) diabatic electronic population revealing the
   impact of the nonadiabatic coupling on the time-dependent dynamics
   (internal conversion process) of NO2. The present study based on more
   accurate ab initio PESs enables us to confirm our earlier estimate of
   the vibronic coupling strength near the energetic minimum of the (X)

Abstract = {{The G-protein-coupled peptide YY (PYY)/neuropeptide YY1 receptor (Y1R)
   subtype is highly expressed in the proliferative zone of human colonic
   crypt epithelial cells but biochemical and biological support for growth
   effects have been lacking. Using a model gut epithelial cell system, we
   have stably expressed the human Y1R in IEC-6 cells and show that the Y1R
   does couple to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation
   and cell growth. This pathway uses pertussis-toxin-sensitive G-proteins
   and beta gamma subunits, inhibited by co-transfected alpha-transducin.
   The Src-family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP1, as well as specific
   inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR
   TK) by PD153035, also blocks PW stimulation of MAPK. This pathway
   further requires protein kinase C with EGFR TK inhibition blocking
   PYY-induced protein kinase C epsilon (PKC epsilon) translocation to the
   cell membrane. Finally, we show that PYY stimulates growth in
   Y1R-expressing gut epithelial cells that is dependent on EGFR TK
   activity. These results demonstrate a novel pathway involving G(i)/G(o)
   protein, EGFR and PKC to activate MAPK. Further, they support a role for
   PYY and the Y1R in regulating growth in human colonic epithelium.}},

Abstract = {{In aqueous solution, bis(nucleoside) complexes formed by the reaction of
   cis-{[}Pt(NH3)(2)(H2O)(2)](2+) with an excess of either adenosine (ado)
   or a mixture of adenosine and guanosine (guo) undergo a slow N7 --> N1
   linkage isomerisation in the adenine moiety. The isomerisation probably
   involves the breaking and reformation of Pt-nucieoside bonds, thus
   favouring the more stable N1 binding mode of the adenine base. Dynamic
   processes due to the presence of adenosine in the platinum coordination
   sphere are slow on the NMR time scale. The N7 binding mode of Pt-II in
   cis-{[}Pt(NH3)(2)(ado-N-7)(2)]-(ClO4)(2). 3.5H(2)O was confirmed by
   X-ray crystal structure analysis. In both of the crystallographically
   independent cations, the Pt-II coordination sphere is almost ideally
   square planar, with typical Pt-N bond lengths and angles. The most
   significant difference between the two cations lies in the sugar
   conformation of the coordinated nucleosides. In one cation, both have an
   anti (-ap) conformation, whilst in the other cation one has an anti
   (-ap) conformation and the other a syn (Ssc) conformation stabilised by
   a relatively strong H-bond. Substitution of the nucleosides by thiourea
   follows an associative mechanism with only a negligible contribution by
   the solvent path. For symmetric complexes, the order of lability of
   different binding modes is ado-N1 < guo-N7 < ado-N7 for substitution of
   the first nucleoside, whereas for the second nucleoside it is guo-N7 <
   ado-N1 < ado-N7. For asymmetric complexes, the concomitant cleavage of
   different Pt-II-nucleoside bonds can be explained by two parallel
   reaction pathways. The change in the (PtI)-I-I coordination sphere
   affects the lability of the coordination nucleosides in a different
   manner. The ado-N1 binding mode renders all binding modes less labile,
   whereas the ado-N7 mode has the opposite effect, and the guo-N7 mode
   increases the lability of the ado-N1 mode but decreases that of the
   ado-N7 mode. The mixed-ligand complex with (ado-N7)(guo-N7) mode is far
   more susceptible to attack by thiourea than the symmetric (guo-N7)2
   species. These two species can be considered as models for the two most
   abundant Cisplatin-DNA adducts.}},

Abstract = {{The chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) has been shown to be
   involved in cell migration. As the receptor CXCR-4 is expressed on
   endothelial cells and upregulated by angiogenic factors, we were
   prompted to study the effect of SDF-1 on angiogenesis in endothelial
   cells from microvasculature. This study demonstrates that SDF-1 induces
   an angiogenic effect in vitro, primarily in a tridimensional fibrin gel.
   The increase in capillary tube formation was evident after a 10-day
   incubation with SDF-1. This was associated with a mild increase in VEGF
   production by microvascular endothelial cells (ELISA and rt-PCR) and a
   potent chemotactic effect. SDF-1 also induced an in vivo angiogenic
   activity as shown in the model of the rabbit corneal pocket. However,
   the angiogenesis was located in an area rich in inflammatory cells. The
   results of our study suggest that these data underline the potential
   role of SDF-1 in angiogenesis as the microvascular endothelial cells
   were greatly involved in this process. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The environmental management of ash produced from the brown coal Fewer
   stations of the Latrobe Valley region of Australia has been studied.
   Current practice consists of slurrying fly and bottom ash, a short
   distance to an ash disposal pond. However, storage facilities are
   approaching capacity and alternative ash management strategies are
   required in the near future. Initially, the ash produced within the
   power stations is known to possess a large soluble mass, which can leach
   rapidly to generate a saline leachate with minor trace metal content.
   After slurrying and deposition within the ash pond, it has been
   demonstrated that the soluble mass is significantly lower and the ash
   can be considered as aged or ``leached{''} ash - a more benign waste
   that meets the criteria for fill material. In order to assess the
   lung-term behaviour of the leached ash and its suitability for
   co-disposal in engineered sites within overburden dumps, two field cells
   were constructed and monitored over a period of 1 year. Each cell was 5
   X 5 m in area, 3-m deep and HDPE lined with a coarse drainage layer and
   leachate collection pipe, The first cell only collected natural rainfall
   and was known as the Dry Cell. The second cell had an external tank of
   5000 1 installed (200-mm rainfall equivalent) and water was
   spray-irrigated regularly to simulate higher rainfall and accelerate the
   leaching process. The cumulative inflow and outflow for each cell has
   been calculated using a linear relationship and the leachate quality was
   monitored over time. The results demonstrate that the ash behaves as an
   unsaturated porous material, with the effect of evaporation through the
   profile being dominant and controlling the production of leachate. The
   leachate quality was initially moderately saline in both cells, with the
   concentration dropping by nearly 95\% in the Wet Cell by the end of the
   field study. The leachate chemistry has been analysed using the PHREEQC
   geochemical model. The log activity plots of various species suggest the
   mineralogical controls on these species in leachate. The full results
   from this study are presented. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We present both theoretical and experimental investigations of optical
   properties of excitons in semiconducror-insulator quantum wires. Spectra
   of linear and nonlinear absorption, photoluminescence and its
   polarization, photoluminescence excitation, time-resolved
   photoluminescence of GaAs, CdSe, and InP quantum wires 4-6 nm in
   diameter, crystallized in dielectric matrix, demonstrate the prominent
   excitonic behavior. In these structures an essential difference of
   dielectric constants of constituent materials lends to a considerable
   enhancement of excitons, the binding energies ranging from 120 meV to
   260 meV and exciton transitions being well distinguished in nanowires
   with sufficient dispersion of diameter even at room temperature. A
   theoretical approach to calculations of the exciton parameters in a
   semiconductor- insulator cylindrical quantum wire of finite diameter is
   developed. This approach accounts for a band-gap renormalization due to
   the spatial confinement and self-image effect, as well as for a
   dielectric enhancement of the electron-hole interaction. The calculated
   exciton transition energies and absorption spectra are consistent with
   the experimental results.}},

Title = {{Mesenchymal expression of nuclear factor-kappa B inhibits epithelial
   growth and branching in the embryonic chick lung}},
Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{225}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{322-338}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{It is becoming increasingly recognized that the ubiquitous, inducible
   transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) is involved in
   developmental processes. For example, NF-kappa B acts as a mediator of
   epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in the developing chick limb. We
   investigated the role of NF-kappa B in directing the branching
   morphogenesis of the developing chick lung, a process which relies on
   epithelial-mesenchymal communication. High level expression of relA was
   found in the mesenchyme surrounding the nonbranching structures of the
   lung but was not detected either in the mesenchyme surrounding the
   branching structures of the distal lung or in the developing lung
   epithelium. Specific inhibition of mesenchymal NF-kappa B in lung
   cultures resulted in increased epithelial budding. Conversely,
   expression of a trans-dominant activator of NF-kappa B in the lung
   mesenchyme repressed budding. Ectopic expression of RelA was sufficient
   to inhibit the ability of the distal mesenchyme to induce epithelial bud
   formation. Cellular proliferation in the mesenchyme was inhibited by
   hyperactivation of NF-kappa B in the mesenchyme of lung cultures.
   Interestingly, increased NF-kappa B activity in the mesenchyme also
   decreased the proliferation of the associated epithelium, while
   inhibition of NF-kappa B activity increased cellular proliferation in
   lung cultures. Expression patterns of several genes which are known to
   influence lung branching morphogenesis were altered in response to
   changes in mesenchymal NF-kappa B activity, including fgf10, bmp-4, and
   tgf-beta 1. Thus NF-kappa B represents the first transcription factor
   reported to function within the lung mesenchyme to limit growth and
   branching of the adjacent epithelium. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Various hereditary diseases analogous to particular human heritable
   diseases have been identified in cattle, Investigation of these cattle
   diseases will provide useful information regarding the pathogenesis of
   the corresponding human diseases. Renal tubular dysplasia is an
   autosomal recessive disease of Japanese black cattle characterized by
   renal failure and growth retardation. We have previously mapped the
   locus responsible for the disease within a region on bovine chromosome
   1. Tn the present study, we further typed additional markers in this
   region and found that a genomic segment of bovine chromosome 1 including
   the microsatellite marker BMS4009 was deleted in the affected animals.
   Construction of a physical map covering this region with BAC clones and
   comparison of the nucleotide sequences of this region between normal and
   affected animals revealed that a region of 37 kb including exons 1 to 4
   of the bovine paracellin-1 gene was deleted in the: affected animals.
   The paracellin-1 gene, which is the causative gene for human renal
   hypomagnesemia with hypercaciuria and nephrocalcinosis, encodes a tight
   junction protein of renal epithelial cells. Therefore, we concluded that
   deletion of the paracellin-1 gene is responsible for renal tubular
   dysplasia of cattle, and the cattle disease could be a good model for
   the human disease. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide on Ca2+ flux
   responses mediated by voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels was studied in
   transverse tubule membrane vesicles from rabbit skeletal muscle.
   Vesicles were loaded with Ca2+ and membrane potentials were generated by
   establishing K+ gradients across the vesicle using the ionophore,
   valinomycin. Anandamide, in the range of 1-100 mu M, inhibited
   depolarization-induced efflux responses. Anandamide also functionally
   modulated the effects of nifedipine (1-10 mu M) and Bay K 8644 (1 mu M)
   on Ca2+ flux responses. Pretreatment with the specific cannabinoid
   receptor antagonist, SR141716A (1 mu M), pertussis toxin (5 mu g/ml),
   the amidohydrolase inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mM) or
   the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (5 mu M) did not alter the
   inhibition of efflux responses by anandamide. Arachidonic acid (10-100
   mu M) also effectively inhibited Ca-45(2+) efflux from membrane
   vesicles. in radioligand binding studies, it was found that both
   anandamide and arachidonic acid inhibited the specific binding of
   {[}H-3]PN 200-110 to transverse tubule membranes with IC50 values of 4.4
   +/- 0.7 and 13.4 +/- 3,5 mu M, respectively. These results indicate that
   anandamide, independent of cannabinoid receptor activation, directly
   inhibits the function of voltage-dependent calcium channels and
   modulates the specific binding of calcium channel ligands of the
   dihydropyridine class. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the involvement of the opioid and

   N/OFQ and the opioid peptides dynorphin B (DYNB) and
   Met-enkephalin-Arg(6) Phe(7) (MEAP) were examined in the
   alcohol-preferring C57BL/6J mice. Basal peptide levels were compared in
   the brain and the pituitary gland with basal levels in the
   alcohol-avoiding DBA/2J mice. Furthermore, the effects of chronic
   alcohol self-administration on peptides were studied in the C57BL/6J
   mice. Compared to the DBA/2J mice, C57BL/6J mice had low immunoreactive
   (ir) levels of DYNB and MEAP in the nucleus accumbens, the hippocampus,
   and the substantia nigra, low ir-DYNB levels in the striatum and low
   ir-MEAP levels in the frontal cortex. Higher ir-DYNB levels in the
   pituitary gland and in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and higher ir-N/OFQ
   levels in the frontal cortex and in the hippocampus were detected in
   C57BL/6J mice compared to the DBA/2J mice. After 4 weeks of voluntary
   alcohol consumption, only minor changes in steady-state peptide levels
   were identified. However, 5 days after the alcohol-drinking period,
   lower levels of all peptides were detected in the ventral tegmental area
   and ir-DYNB levels were also lower in the amygdala and in the substantia

   the amygdala and substantia nigra as compared to control C57BL/6J mice.
   This study demonstrates strain differences between C57BL/6J mice and
   DBA/2J mice that could contribute to divergent drug-taking behaviour,

Abstract = {{Triplet repeat sequence (TRS) inserts containing (CTG.CAG)(n) (17-175
   units in length) were tandemly duplicated when propagated in plasmids in
   Escherichia coli, The products of this novel type of TRS genetic
   instability are tracts of as many as 34 multiple units, which contain
   the entire TRS as well as 129 base pairs of nonrepetitive flanking
   sequence. The duplication process required the presence of two or more
   TRS-containing units. Close proximity (170 base pairs) of the TRS to the
   R6K gamma origin of replication of the pUTminiTn5Cm-derived constructs
   stimulated the tandem duplication process. These events are proposed to
   occur due to secondary structure formation, stalling of DNA synthesis,

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. Blacks are less likely than whites to develop bladder
   cancer; although once diagnosed, blacks experience poorer survival. This
   study sought to examine multiple biological and behavioral factors and
   their influence on extent of disease.
   METHODS. A population-based cohort of black bladder cancer patients and
   a random sample of frequency-matched white bladder cancer patients,
   stratified by age, gender, and race were identified through cancer
   registry systems in metropolitan Atlanta, New Orleans, and the San
   Francisco/Oakland area. Patients were ages 20-79 years at bladder cancer
   diagnosis from 1985-1987, and had no previous cancer history. Medical
   records were reviewed at initial diagnosis. Of the patients selected for
   study, a total of 77\% of patients was interviewed. Grade, stage, and
   other variables (including age, socioeconomic status, symptom duration,
   and smoking history) were recorded. Extent of disease was modeled in 497
   patients with urothelial carcinoma using logistic regression.
   RESULTS. Extent of disease at diagnosis was significantly greater in
   Blacks than in Whites. Older age group, higher tumor grade, larger
   tumors, and presence of carcinoma in situ were related to greater extent
   of disease in blacks and in whites. Large disparities between blacks and
   whites were found for socioeconomic status and source of care. Blacks
   had greater symptom duration and higher grade. Black women were more
   likely to have invasive disease than white women; this difference was
   not seen among men. Blacks in unskilled occupational categories, perhaps
   reflecting socioeconomic factors, were at much higher risk for muscle
   invasion than whites.
   CONCLUSIONS. While specific relationships between variables were noted,
   an overall pattern defining black and white differences in stage did not
   emerge. Future studies should examine the basis upon which occupation
   and life style factors operate by using biochemical and molecular
   methods to study the genetic factors involved. Published 2000 by the
   American Cancer Society.{*}.}},

Abstract = {{The biological significance of cytosine methylation is as yet
   Incompletely understood, but substantial and growing evidence strongly
   suggests that perturbation of methylation patterns, resulting from the
   infidelity of DMA cytosine methyltransferase, is an important component
   of the development of human cancer. We have developed a novel in vitro
   assay that allows us to quantitatively determine the DNA substrate
   preferences of cytosine methylases. This approach, which we call mass
   tagging, involves the labeling of target cytosine residues in synthetic
   DNA duplexes with stable isotopes, such as N-15. Methylation is then
   measured by the formation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry. The DNA substrate selectivity is
   determined from the mass spectrum of the product 5mC. With the
   nonsymmetrical duplex DNA substrate examined in this study we find that
   the bacterial methyltransferase HpaII (duplex DNA recognition sequence
   CCGG) methylates the one methylatable cytosine of each strand similarly,
   Introduction of an A-C mispair at the methylation site shifts
   methylation exclusively to the mispaired cytosine residue. In direct
   competition assays:with HpaII methylase we observe that the mispaired
   substrate is methylated more extensively than the fully complementary,
   normal substrate, although both have one HpaII methylation site. Through
   the use of this approach we will be able to learn more about the
   mechanisms by which methylation patterns can become altered.}},

Abstract = {{A real matrix A is called an L-matrix if every matrix with the same sign
   pattern as A has linearly independent columns. A nearly L-matrix is a
   matrix which is not an L-matrix, but each matrix obtained by deleting
   one of its columns is an L-matrix. A generalized row sign balanced
   (GRSB) matrix is a matrix which can be transformed to a matrix having
   both positive and negative entries in each row by multiplying some of
   its columns by -1. In this Raper, we study the relations between
   L-matrices, nearly L-matrices and GRSB matrices. We obtain a complete
   characterization of nearly L-matrices in terms of GRSB matrices. By
   comparing this result with a well-known theorem about L-indecomposable,
   barely L-matrices, we find an interesting duality relation between
   L-matrices and GRSB matrices. We also use GRSB matrices to characterize
   the conditional S{*}-matrices (which are closely related to nearly
   L-matrices and the conditionally sign solvable linear systems). Finally,
   we propose some unsolved problems for further research. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Although interruption of CD40-CD40L interactions via their respective
   mAbs yields prolonged allograft survival, the relative importance of
   CD40 or CD40L on donor or host cells remains unknown. Moreover, it is
   uncertain whether any allospecific tolerance occurring with CD40-CD40L
   blockade will also prevent allograft arteriopathy, the major long-term
   limitation to transplantation. Therefore, we performed cardiac
   transplantations using CD40L-deficient (CD40L(-/-)) mice to investigate
   the mechanisms underlying prolonged allograft survival. Without
   immunosuppression, wild-type (WT) hosts rejected allo-mismatched WT or
   CD40L(-/-) heart allografts within 2 wk, Conversely, allografts in
   CD40L(-/-) hosts beat vigorously for 12 wk, Anti-CD40 treatment did not
   induce graft failure in CD40L(-/-) recipients. Although
   graft-infiltrating cells were reduced similar to 50\% in
   CD40L(-/-)hosts, the relative percentages of macrophages and T cell
   subsets were comparable to WT. IFN-gamma TNF-alpha, and IL-10 were
   diminished commensurate with the reduced cellular infiltrate; IL-4 was
   not detected. CD40L(-/-) recipients did not develop IgG alloantibodies
   and showed diminished B7 and CD28 expression on subsets of
   graft-infiltrating cells. CD40L(-/-) transplant recipients developed
   allospecific tolerance to the donor haplotype; second set donor skin
   grafts engrafted well, whereas third-party skin grafts were vigorously
   rejected. By MLR, splenocytes from CD40L(-/-) allograft recipients also
   demonstrated allo-specific hyporesponsiveness, Nevertheless, allografts
   in CD40L(-/-) hosts developed significant graft arteriosclerosis by 8-12
   wk posttransplant. Therefore, we propose that early alloresponses,
   without CD40-CD40L costimulation, induce allospecific tolerance but may
   trigger allo-independent mechanisms that ultimately result in graft
   vasculopathy.}},

Title = {{Differential activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38

Abstract = {{Methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), a direct-acting alkylating agent, is a
   strong brain carcinogen but a poor hepatocarcinogen in rats. To
   elucidate the mechanism(s) leading to tissue-specific carcinogenesis in
   response to MMS, we compared the activation of the stress-activated
   protein kinases (SAPKs), the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, in
   the liver and brain of rats after i.p. injection of MMS, p38 was
   activated in both the liver and brain, but JNK was activated only in the
   liver in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The activation of JNK was
   preceded by the activation of SAPK or extracellular signal-regulated
   protein kinase kinase 1/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 in the
   liver, but no activation of SAPK or extracellular signal-regulated
   protein kinase kinase 1/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 was
   observed in the brain. The activation of JNK in the liver was
   accompanied by increased phosphorylation of activating transcription
   factor 2 and followed by an increase in the phosphorylation and level of
   c-Jun protein, in contrast to no such changes in the brain. To study the
   physiological consequences of these differential molecular events in the
   liver and brain, we examined MMS-induced apoptosis, a process shown to
   involve stress kinase activation. A significant increase in apoptotic
   cell death was detected in the liver but not in the brain after a MMS
   injection, which correlated with the patterns of JNK activation in the
   liver, Taken together, our results demonstrate that a tissue-specific
   signaling pathway(s) leading to distinct physiological responses in the
   liver and brain of rats exposed to MMS exists, suggesting a possible
   explanation for tissue-specific carcinogenic effects exerted by MMS in
   vivo.}},

Abstract = {{We model the evolution of the concentration held of macromolecules in a
   rectangular asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation channel using
   center manifold techniques. The deviation of the primary now from a
   parabolic profile influences the concentration field and this is
   investigated to complement previously known results. The long-term
   evolution of the components of the sample is shown to be well described
   by a one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation. The coefficients of
   this equation are determined by the rigorous analysis of the complete
   set of equations governing the two-dimensional fluid now. This model
   gives quantitative predictions of the elution time of the samples, the
   width of the concentration pulse, and the resolution of the apparatus.
   The influence of initial sample width and effects of the secondary
   relaxation from focusing to elution conditions are discussed. Reported
   theoretical predictions are in agreement with experimental results
   published previously.}},

Abstract = {{The albumin-alpha-fetoprotein locus epitomizes the main features of
   transcriptional regulation of fetal and adult hepatocyte-specific genes:
   developmentally regulated promoters and strong distant enhancers. Full
   enhancer activity required only a proximal albumin-promoter region
   containing the TATA box, hepatic nuclear factor 1 (HNF1), and nuclear
   factor Y (NF-Y) sites. Deletion of the HNF1 site abrogated enhancer and
   promoter activity, whereas methylation of the site reduced all activity
   by about 3-fold. Deletion of the NF-Y site attenuated activity by about
   half, but much of the activity could be replaced by juxtaposition of an
   upstream region (designated distal element TV). Gel shift and
   competition analysis demonstrated that binding of architectural factors
   overlapped NF-Y binding. Moreover, a mutation that eliminated NF-Y
   binding but only minimally perturbed the surrounding region did not
   affect enhancer function. In plasmids with a second promoter, the
   enhancers simultaneously stimulated both albumin and Lu-fetoprotein
   promoters with minimal competition, but surprisingly some mutations in
   the albumin promoter attenuated expression from both promoters, whereas
   another uncoupled their expression. With single promoters, the function
   of the proximal promoter region was controlled by three parameters in
   the following hierarchy: HNF1 binding > local architecture > NF-Y
   binding, but integrated two-promoter function had a much greater
   dependence on NF-Y.}},

Abstract = {{High-performance liquid chromatography was used to measure concentration
   of 8-chloroadenosine (8-Cl-A) and its two major metabolites
   8-chloroadenine (8-Cl-Ad) and 8-chloroinosine (8-Cl-I), and their
   pharmacokinetics in dogs. 8-Cl-A and its metabolites in serum were
   treated by deproteinization with acetonitrile, then organic impurities
   were extracted with dichloromethane, followed by centrifuged and direct
   injection of the supernatant into the liquid chromatograph. After
   intravenous injection of 8-Cl-A (30 mg/kg), the parent drug and 8-Cl-I
   were not detected, but the other metabolite, 8-Cl-Ad, was found at a
   high concentration for 240 min in dog serum. The main pharmacokinetic
   parameters of 8-Cl-Ad, t(1/2 beta) and AUC, were 69.30 min and 580 mu g
   min/ml. Our finding indicates that in dogs 8-Cl-A is rapidly metabolized
   and forms its major metabolites, 8-Cl-Ad and 8-Cl-I. 8-Cl-Ad appeared in
   many tissues, but 8-Cl-A and 8-Cl-I did not. The concentration of
   8-Cl-Ad in dog tissues was highest in the liver and spleen, intermediate
   in the kidney, intestine, and lowest in the bone marrow, heart, and
   lungs. However, it was not detected in some liposoluble tissues such as
   the testes, brain, or uterus. Our study provides useful information for

Abstract = {{Neutrophil granulocytes are among the first cells to encounter a plasma
   protein-coated implant and may through frustrated phagocytosis release
   toxic oxidative species. We used two model surfaces, hydrophobic and
   hydrophilic glass, to investigate the effects of plasma immunoglobulin G
   (IgG)-complement interactions for neutrophil adhesion and respiratory
   burst. The respiratory burst was measured with luminol-amplified
   chemiluminescence and cell adhesion was determined by labeling
   neutrophils with 2', 7'-bis-(carboxy-ethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. We
   demonstrate that the IgG-triggered neutrophil adhesion and oxygen
   radical production is augmented in the presence of normal human serum,
   in particular on hydrophobic surfaces, indicating that complement
   factors enhance the neutrophil activation. We propose that the
   complement factors C3, C5a, and Clq are especially important fur this
   amplification, but factor B is probably not. Disturbance of the actin
   filament dynamics with cytochalasin B or jasplakinolide blocked the
   neutrophil radical generation on all surfaces. However, these drugs did
   not affect the number of adherent neutrophils. We suggest that there is
   a synergistic interaction between adsorbed IgG, and the complement
   system, which amplifies the neutrophil acute inflammatory responses
   through a dynamic actin cytoskeleton on synthetic surfaces. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Solid solutions of xPb(Yb1/2Nb1/2)O-3-(1-x)Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O-3,
   x=0-0.25, were investigated from the viewpoint of structural,
   dielectric, and piezoelectric properties. With increasing
   Pb(Yb1/2Nb1/2)O-3 content (x), the structural change occurred from the
   tetragonal to the pseudocubic phase at room temperature. The
   morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) between the tetragonal and pseudocubic
   phases was shown in the region of x=0.05-0.10. Polarization and
   electric-field-induced strain exhibited a maximum at the composition
   near MPB. It may be concluded that both the ease of domain switching and
   the enhanced polarization play an important role in bringing about large
   electric-field-induced strain. At this composition, the remnant
   polarization and coercive field were 29.5 mu C/cm(2) and 4.5 kV/cm at 17
   kV/cm, respectively, and a maximum electric-field-induced strain of
   0.97x10(-3) at 25 kV/cm was obtained. Also, the electromechanical
   coupling coefficient (K-p) and mechanical quality factor (Q(m)) were
   0.47 and 65, respectively. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was shown to
   produce atypical subgenomic RNAs that contain open reading frame la
   nucleotides and are present under a wide variety of culture conditions,
   including high and low multiplicities of infection, in simian and
   porcine host cells, and during infection with cell-adapted and wild-type
   PRRSV strains. Sequence analysis demonstrated that they are
   heterogeneous in 5'-3' junction sequence and size and may code for
   different predicted fusion proteins. This is the first report of these
   novel RNAs in arteriviruses and we have termed them heteroclite (meaning
   ``deviating from common forms or rules{''}) subgenomic RNAs. The unique
   properties of these subgenomic RNAs include (a) apparent association
   with normal virus infection and stability during serial passage, (b)
   packaging of heteroclite RNAs into virus-like particles, (c) short,
   heterogeneous sequences which may mediate the generation of these RNAs,
   (d) a primary structure which consists of the two genomic termini with
   one large internal deletion, and (e) little apparent interference with
   parental virus replication. These subgenomic RNAs may be critical to, or
   a necessary side product of, viral replication. The expression of these
   novel RNA species support the template-switching model of
   similarity-assisted RNA recombination, In summary, PRRSV readily
   undergoes nonhomologous RNA recombination to generate heteroclite
   subgenomic RNAs. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

   of the corrosion products was studied by X-ray, SEM, TEM and HRTEM.
   Adding Y2O3 reduces the corrosion rate. This is particularly observed in
   the long-term behavior of the batteries and is more pronounced at higher
   temperature. When yttrium is added as an oxide to the electrode or
   electrolyte, it is dissolved in the electrolyte and is further
   incorporated as hydroxide in the corrosion scale. The decrease in the
   global alloy corrosion rate can be explained by a decrease of the
   driving force for diffusion of Mm(3+) and OH-. Yb is the rare earth
   element which is expected to produce the largest decrease in corrosion
   rate, since its solubility in the electrolyte and its content in the
   corrosion scale are higher than for any other rare earth element. (C)

Title = {{Binuclear homoleptic iron carbonyls: Incorporation of formal iron-iron

Abstract = {{The homoleptic binuclear compound Fe-2(CO)(9) is well characterized
   experimentally, although there has been some discussion as to the nature
   of the iron-iron bond, which is at most a single bond. In this research,
   we consider homoleptic iron carbonyls that satisfy the 18-electron rule
   but may have formal double Fe-2(CO)(8) (seven distinct structures),
   triple Fe-2(CO)(7) (three distinct structures), and even quadruple
   Fe-2(CO)(6) (seven distinct structures) iron-iron bonds. These novel
   structures are characterized in terms of their equilibrium geometries,
   thermochemistry, and vibrational frequencies. The range of predicted
   iron-iron distances is remarkable, from 2.52 Angstrom for the known
   Fe-2(CO)(9) to 2.00 Angstrom for the unbridged quadruple bond species
   Fe-2(CO)(6). The lowest energy structure of Fe-2(CO)(7) is a distorted
   unbridged C-s symmetry structure with iron-iron separation 2.23
   Angstrom. This is followed energetically by the tribridged structure
   with bond distance 2.21 Angstrom, and finally by the monobridged
   structure with iron-iron distance 2.13 Angstrom. The latter structure is
   consistent with an Fe=Fe triple bond, but is not a genuine minimum. For
   Fe-2(CO)(6) the lowest energy structure is the distorted dibridged
   structure with perhaps a weak Fe=Fe double bond. However, the unbridged
   Fe-2(CO)(6) structure with an iron-iron bond distance of 2.00 Angstrom
   (suggesting a quadruple bond) is also a genuine minimum, The unsaturated
   structures Fe-2(CO)(8) and Fe-2(CO)(7), are thermodynamically resistant
   to CO removal. The iron-iron linkages are also analyzed in terms of
   contributions from the different vibrational potential energy
   distributions. A clear Badger's Rule correlation between Fe-Fe
   vibrational frequency and bond distance is established. Prospects for
   the synthesis of these and related diiron compounds are discussed in
   some detail. The most promising routes to preparation of these
   fascinating species would appear to be matrix isolation or iron vapor
   synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Nested chromosomal deletions are powerful genetic tools. They are
   particularly suited for identifying essential genes in development
   either directly or by screening induced mutations against a deletion. To
   apply this approach to the functional analysis of mouse chromosome 2, a
   strategy for the rapid generation of nested deletions with Cre
   recombinase was developed and tested. A loxP site was targeted to the
   Notch1 gene on chromosome 2. A targeted line was cotransfected with a
   second loxP site and a plasmid for transient expression of Cre,
   Independent random integrations of the second loxP site onto the
   targeted chromosome in direct repeat orientation created multiple nested
   deletions. By virtue of targeting in an F-1 hybrid embryonic stem cell
   line, F-1(129S1 xCast/Ei), the deletions could be verified and rapidly
   mapped. Ten deletions fell into seven size classes, with the largest
   extending six or seven centiMorgans. The cytology of the deletion
   chromosomes were determined by fluorescent in site hybridization, Eight
   deletions were cytologically normal, but the two largest deletions had
   additional rearrangements. Three deletions, including the largest
   unrearranged deletion, have been transmitted through the germ line.
   Several endpoints also have been cloned by plasmid rescue. These
   experiments illustrate the means to rapidly create and map deletions
   anywhere in the mouse genome. They also demonstrate an improved method
   for generating nested deletions in embryonic stem cells.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the suspicion of a gynaecologist, a pathologist was suspected of
   incorrect diagnoses in cases of breast cancer and the interchanging of
   tissue samples. Many women applied to the attorney's bureau to clarify
   the reproaches. The privately owned laboratory for pathology was
   searched and 920 histological slides, roughly the same number of
   paraffin blocks and about 20 formalin fixed tissue samples were
   confiscated. Together with other confiscated material, at least 1236
   histological slides and additional 249 paraffin blocks had to be sorted.
   Histological slides and paraffin blocks were matched with patients as
   far as possible following the laboratory book. Many of the warranted
   samples which were diagnosed as containing the carcinoma by the
   pathologist were missing. A total of 160 samples were chosen and
   rediagnosed by two independent pathologists. The formalin fixed tissue
   was negative for DNA most likely due to storage in formalin for years.
   Most of the histological slides were positive for DNA. On the whole, 18
   expertises about histological findings and the DNA results were given.
   In some cases only DNA results could be presented, as previous experts
   had only performed DNA examinations without controlling the histological
   diagnosis. In six cases a carcinoma could be confirmed and the DNA
   profile marched with patient's DNA; in seven cases a carcinoma was
   confirmed without march with the patient; in two cases the carcinoma
   could not be confirmed in the presented samples. A jurisdictional
   solution was impossible because the accused pathologist died during the
   investigation. In conclusion, it must be stated that a DNA examination
   of histological slides should never be performed without a rediagnosis
   of an independent pathologist and photographic documentation of the
   findings. Whenever possible, material should be left on the slide. (C)

   either due to bacterial spread from bacterial endocarditis, mycoses, or
   from HIV-I infection. Other complications include hypoxic-ischemic
   changes with cerebral edema, ischemic neuronal damage and neuronal loss,
   which are assumed to occur under conditions of prolonged heroin-induced
   respiratory depression, stroke due to, for example, thrombembolism,
   vasculitis, septic emboli, hypotension, and positional vascular
   compression. Myelopathy is believed to be the result of;ln isolated
   vascular accident within the spinal cord due to an as yet unknown
   mechanism. A distinct entity, spongiform leukoencephalopathy, has been
   described mainly after inhalation of pre heated heroin. A lipophilic
   toxin-induced process was considered to be clue to contaminants and to
   be induced or enhanced by cerebral hypoxia, but a definite toxin could
   not be identified. At the cellular level, abnormalities in signal
   transduction systems and changes of various receptor densities have been
   reported. The exact etiology of the different neuropathological
   alterations associated with heroin abuse is still unclear, but may also
   be related to additional substances used as adulterants. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{A series of heteroepitaxial Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 were grown on
   0.29(LaAlO3):0.35(Sr2TaAlO6) substrates using pulsed-laser deposition.
   X-ray characterization revealed compressive in-plane stresses in the
   thinnest films, which were relaxed in a continuous fashion with
   increasing thickness. A theoretical treatment of the misfit strain was
   in good agreement with the measured out-of-plane lattice parameter. The
   low-frequency dielectric constant was measured to be significantly less
   than the bulk value and found to decrease rapidly for films less than
   100 nm. A thermodynamic model was developed to understand the reduction
   in dielectric constant. By observing the microstructure using plan-view
   and cross-section transmission electron microscopy, we identified local
   strain associated with a threading dislocation density on the order of
   10(11) cm(-2) as a possible mechanism for dielectric degradation in
   these films. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

   camera technology. With the use of a radio-frequency-based spiral
   scanning sub-ps resolution can be maintained for an observation interval
   as long as 10 ns. In the new scheme, two operational regimes can be set
   for the camera. The first one is the circular scanning regime, which is
   suitable for single-light pulses with a total duration less than one RF
   period. The second regime accomplishes a spiral scanning, i.e., a
   circular scanning with variable strength, to overcome the problem of
   small duration of RF period. This regime is provided by an appropriate
   decrease in amplitude for the RF field in the cavities of the camera. A
   spiral scanning technique can be realized by the fast RF energy
   transition between two coupled cavities driven by a microwave switch.

   D5S818, D13S317, D7S820) was used to generate allele frequency databases
   for two Hungarian population samples, Caucasians from the Budapest area
   and Romanies from Baranya county. During the analysis two intermediate
   sized alleles and a sequence variant allele were observed at the D7S820
   locus. All three types of allelic variants were found to have
   modification (deletion, insertion, transversion) in the same block of a
   (T)(9) stretch located within the 3' flanking region of each allele,
   which may indicate a possible higher mutation rate of this (T)(9) block.
   For the loci D3S1358 and D7S820 the Romany population database showed
   departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The forensic efficiency
   values for the Romany population were slightly different from those
   found in the Hungarian Caucasian population. Comparing the allele
   frequency values by G-statistic, calculating the F-st indices and with
   the pairwise comparisons of inter-population variance, the two Hungarian
   populations could be distinguished using data of the eight STR loci. (C)

Abstract = {{Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) is a very rare congenital (autosomal
   recessive) condition with fetal onset. Only a few cases have been
   published on the basis of both clinical data (symptoms/neuroradiological
   imaging) and autopsy results. This paper reports on such a case
   involving a 1.5-year-old male infant. The child suffered from severe
   psychomotor delay, extrapyramidal dyskinesia and epileptic seizures, but
   did not exhibit signs of spinal muscular atrophy as related to PCH type
   1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the age of 6 months demonstrated
   olivo-pontine and bilateral cerebellar hypoplasia. The boy was
   unexpectedly found dead. Autopsy disclosed a severe aspiration of
   gastric contents as the final cause of death. The neuropathological
   examination confirmed PCH type 2 (according to Earth {[}Brain Dev., 15
   (1993) 411-422]) with marked microcephaly and olivopontocerebellar
   hypoplasia. Histologically, decreased density of olivo-pontine neurons,
   reduction of granular and Purkinje's cell layers of the cerebellum,
   slight astroglial proliferation and fragmented appearance of the dentate
   nuclei were observed. The immunohistochemical expression pattern was
   determined using antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein,
   synaptophysin and neurofilament pl otc in. Summarizing, typical features
   of PCH type 2 were present and proved by clinical course, MRI and
   autopsy. Despite severe symptoms due to a natural disease this rare
   neurogenetic entity can become of forensic interest, when sudden
   unexpected death occurs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We experienced an autopsy case, small testes and tall stature, which
   suggested Klinefelter's syndrome. DNA analysis was performed to confirm
   the genetic abnormality. Case History: A 28-year-old man who was single
   and lived with his parents. He suddenly lost his consciousness in a
   sitting room and died. Autopsy findings: He was 176 cm in height and 57
   kg in weight. The post-mortem hypostasis was red-purple on his back, and
   rigor mortis was strong in each joint of the whole body. The heart
   weighted 340 g, in which dark red fluidal blood (300 ml) without
   coagulation was contained. The testes were smaller than normal adult
   male (left and right testes with epididymides weighted 8.1 g and 6.0 g,
   respectively). As a results of pathological examination, clumped Leydig
   cells, sclerotic and hyalined tubules were observed. Some germ cells
   with spermatozoid were also present. DNA Analysis: Generally,
   Klinefelter's syndrome is determined by karyotype analysis and/or the
   detection of sex chromatin. However, in this case, karyotype analysis
   and the detection of sex chromatin could not be demonstrated, because
   the blood which was: collected in the autopsy became too old. Therefore,
   we tried sex determination and STR analysis (HPRT, HUMARA and DXS 1470)
   using DNA extracted from stored blood materials. Consequently, in the
   sex determination, no different situation was found in the X- and
   Y-specific bands from normal male's and as results of STR analyses, we
   could nut corroborate the Klinefelter's syndrome. (C) 2000 Elsevier

   used in major surgery and treatment of pain in tumor patients. Cases of
   fentanyl abuse by intravenous injection, inhalation, or al ol nasal
   application have been reported especially in the USA. Therapeutic levels
   of fentanyl are as low as 1 ng/ml of serum and therefore a screening
   test must have a detection limit below that concentration. Recently
   three non-radioactive enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) have become
   commercially available from COZART, STC and DIAGNOSTIX, all of them
   supplied by MAHSAN Diagnostika for evaluation with serum samples from
   Forensic and clinical cases. A calibration curve is obtained with
   samples that contain 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5 ng fentanyl per ml of negative
   serum. The calibration curve of COZART is especially in the low range,
   steeper than those of STC and DIAGNOSTIX. The cut-off for all these
   EIAs, however, can be: Yet at 0.5 ng/ml. After the administration of
   therapeutic doses, fentanyl concentrations were between 3 and more than
   5 ng/ml as determined with the EIAs. The presence of the typical drugs
   of abuse, e.g. heroin, methadone, cocaine, cannabinoids and amphetamines
   including the derivatives of methylenedioxyamphetamine, don't generate
   false-positive results. No cross-reactivity was also observed at toxic
   levels of benzodiazepines and paracetamol and therapeutic levels of
   barbiturates, phenothiazines, antidepressants and analgesics. The EIAs
   tested so far appear to be suitable for the detection of fentanyl at
   therapeutic levels. False-positive results or cross-reactivity towards
   other compounds have not been observed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Month = {{SEP 11}},
Abstract = {{Our laboratory and others have reported that pupillary constrictions
   following application of the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine are
   increased in depressed patients. Moreover, mood improvements in manic
   patients, given lithium or Depakote(R), are also correlated with
   increases in pupil sensitivity. The present report describes the
   relationship between symptom severity and cholinergic sensitivity in a
   larger group (N = 20) of manic patients (bipolar I; 296.4x). Pupil
   responses to pilocarpine eye: drops (0-2\%) were recorded using infrared
   pupillometry. The results were compared with pupil sizes measured under
   conditions of cholinergic blockade (0.5\% tropicamide). Pupil responses
   were computed as percentages of the maximal range of areas measured
   under saturating agonist and antagonist conditions. Dose response curves
   were subjected to a log-legit transformation and ED50 values were
   determined by weighted least squares regression. Bech-Rafaelsen mania
   ratings were found to be linearly related to ED50 values (r = 0.48).
   Patients with more severe mania required higher concentrations of
   pilocarpine in order to elicit a 50\% reduction in pupil size. The
   present findings support a putative cholinergic role in the regulation
   of mood state. Moreover, the results suggest that pupillary responses
   may provide a simple and non-invasive means to evaluate cholinergic
   sensitivity in patients with affective disorders. (C) 2000 Published by

Abstract = {{Although cognitive impairments are well recognized in patients with
   schizophrenia, it is unclear which impairments are due to a genetic
   predisposition and which are caused by secondary disease effects or
   phenotype. The aim of this study is to investigate: the possible
   relationship between genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia and
   cognitive functioning. Three groups of subjects were compared: 14
   patients with schizophrenia, 15 healthy siblings and 32 healthy control
   subjects. All subjects were tested neuropsychologically. The raw test
   data were rescaled to standard equivalents (z-scores). Subjects' z
   scores on tests assessing the same cognitive domain were clustered and
   analyzed. Differences in cognitive functioning were found in the domains
   of abstraction, attention, executive functioning, spatial memory, and
   sensory-motor functioning. The schizophrenic probands were impaired on
   all these five domains whereas the healthy probands showed impairments
   on executive functioning and partially on sensory-motor functioning.
   Furthermore, for spatial memory the significant finding could mainly be
   attributed to impaired functioning in the patients, but not healthy
   siblings or control subjects, whereas for executive functioning patients
   and healthy siblings seemed equally impaired as compared to control
   subjects. The planning time of the Tower of London (TOL) and the
   initiation time of the Motor Planning Task (MPT) were used for measures
   of executive functioning, while the `time to move of the Motor Planning
   Task' was used as measures of sensory motor functioning. These results
   suggest that the cognitive abnormalities in schizophrenia that may be
   related to genotype are represented in the domain of executive
   functioning and to some extent in the domain of sensory-motor
   functioning. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   detected in the urine with REMEDi HS. Most of the psilocin was excreted

   first step in analysis. Free psilocin was determined at a concentration
   of 0.23 mg/l while the total amount was 1.76 mg/l urine. The
   concentration of psilocin in serum was too low for detection with REMEDi
   HS. We proved a GC-MS-method with d(3)-morphine as internal standard and
   silylation with MSTFA. Similarly to urine, most of the psilocin in serum
   was found in the conjugated form. The concentration of free psilocin was
   0.018 mg/l, that of total psilocin, 0.052 mg/l serum. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We develop the exact solution for a stochastic plant disease model with
   nonlinear density dependence and time-decaying susceptibility. In our
   biological application only the transient behaviour, rather than the
   stationary state, is relevant. To model the population noise we use the
   Master equation, lending to a linear ordinary differential equation
   system with finally time-independent coefficients. A numerically stable
   procedure is given by the Pade approximation of the solution in form of
   an exponential of a matrix. On the basis of this solution the parameter
   estimation is performed using experimental data from epidemiological
   microcosms.
   In the Master equation formalism, in order to generalize to more
   complicated models, for example, including a time-independent latent
   period as a first multivariate model, we finally suggest a numerical
   procedure to estimate the likelihood comparing data time series with
   simulated Master equation time series. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A mechanical strain field applied to a monodomain cholesteric elastomer
   will unwind the helical director distribution. There are similarities
   with the classical problem of an electric field applied to a cholesteric
   liquid crystal but also differences. Frank elasticity is of minor
   importance unless the gel is very weak. The interplay is between the
   director being helically anchored to the rubber elastic matrix and the
   external mechanical field. Stretching perpendicular to the helix axis
   induces the uniform unwound state via the elimination of sharp, pinned
   twist walls above a critical strain. Unwinding through conical director
   states occurs when the elastomer is stretched along the helical axis.}},

Title = {{Experimental evidence for a new instability of a vertical columnar
   vortex pair in a strongly stratified fluid}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{418}},
Pages = {{167-188}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{This paper shows that a long vertical columnar vortex pair created by a
   double flap apparatus in a strongly stratified Fluid is subjected to an
   instability distinct from the Crow and short-wavelength instabilities
   known to occur in homogeneous fluid. This new instability, which we name
   zigzag instability, is antisymmetric with respect to the plane
   separating the vortices. It is characterized by a vertically modulated
   twisting and bending of the whole vortex pair with almost no change of
   the dipole's cross-sectional structure. No saturation is observed and,
   ultimately, the vortex pair is sliced into thin horizontal layers of
   independent pancake dipoles. For the largest Brunt-Vaisala frequency N =
   1.75 rad s(-1) that may be achieved in the experiments, the zigzag
   instability is observed only in the range of Froude numbers: 0.13 < F-h0
   < 0.21 (F-h0 = U-0/NR, where U-0 and R are the initial dipole travelling
   velocity and radius). When F-h0 > 0.21, the elliptic instability
   develops resulting in three-dimensional motions which eventually
   collapse into a relaminarized vortex pair. Irregular zigzags are then
   also observed to grow. The threshold for the inhibition of the elliptic
   instability F-h0 = 0.2+/-0.01 is independent of N and in good agreement
   with the theoretical study of Miyazaki \& Fukumoto (1992). Complete
   stabilization for F-h0 < 0.13 is probably due to viscous effects since
   the associated Reynolds number is low, Re-0 < 260. In geophysical flows
   characterized by low Froude numbers and large Reynolds numbers, we
   conjecture that this viscous stabilization will occur at much lower
   Froude number.
   It is tentatively argued that this new type of instability may explain
   the layering widely observed in stratified turbulent flows.}},

Abstract = {{The detection and differentiation of C-4 hydrocarbon gases, including
   n-butane, 1-butene, iso-butylene, cis- and trans-2-butene are
   investigated over a palladium-promoted tin oxide sensor using AC
   impedance. It is found that 1\% Pd-SnO2 gives a good linear response and
   good sensitivity with respect to a wide range of n-butane concentrations
   (0-10,000 ppm). At high operation temperatures (greater than or equal to
   400 degrees C), the tin oxide-based sensor offers no differentiation on
   different C-4 gases and is consistent with the literature that this type
   of sensor is rather non-selective. However, at less than or equal to 300
   degrees C, the sensor gave broadly two different types of sensitivity
   towards the C-4 gases of the same concentration: the sensitivities of
   n-butane and trans-a-butene are analogous, while I-butene, iso-butylene
   and cis-2-butene all show sensitivities a factor of 20-30 higher. The
   sensitivity difference apparently depends on the chemical reactivity of
   the particular C-4 molecules, which in turn depends on the presence and
   position of their double bond. Hence, high sensitivity is obtained if
   the positions of their double bond are more susceptible for attack by
   surface oxygen species leading to total surface combustion of the C-4
   hydrocarbons. On the other hand, if there is an absence or a surface
   inaccessible double bond as in the cases of n-butane and the
   trans-a-butene, surface attack to the hydrocarbon gases involves a
   kinetically more difficult hydrogen abstraction reaction, hence giving a
   lower sensitivity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new parallel supercomputer implementation of the Monte
   Carlo method for simulating the dynamical evolution of globular star
   clusters. Our method is based on a modified version of Henon's Monte
   Carlo algorithm for solving the Fokker-Planck equation. Our code allows
   us to follow the evolution of a cluster containing up to 5 x 10(5) stars
   to core collapse in less than or similar to 40 hours of computing time.
   In this paper we present the results of test calculations for clusters
   with equal-mass stars, starting from both Plummer and King model initial
   conditions. We consider isolated as well as tidally truncated clusters.
   Our results are compared to those obtained from approximate,
   self-similar analytic solutions, from direct numerical integrations of
   the Fokker-Planck equation, and from direct N-body integrations
   performed on a GRAPE-4 special-purpose computer with N = 16384. In all
   cases we find excellent agreement with other methods, establishing our
   new code as a robust tool for the numerical study of globular cluster
   dynamics using a realistic number of stars.}},

   Antarctica occurs in February, and hence the detection of snow cover
   during January and February should indicate a depletion phase. An
   overall 14\% decrease of snow has been observed during this period.
   Corresponding data for accumulation/depletion of snow indicates a

Abstract = {{Recent numerical simulations of self-gravitating protostellar disks have
   suggested that gravitational instabilities can lead to the production of
   substellar companions. In these simulations, the disk is typically
   assumed to be locally isothermal; i.e., the initial, axisymmetric
   temperature in the disk remains everywhere unchanged. Such an idealized
   condition implies extremely efficient cooling for outwardly moving
   parcels of gas. While we have seen disk disruption in our own locally
   isothermal simulations of a small, massive protostellar disk, no
   long-lived companions formed as a result of the instabilities. Instead,
   thermal and tidal effects and the complex interactions of the disk
   material prevented permanent condensations from forming, despite the
   vigorous growth of spiral instabilities. In order to compare our results
   more directly with those of other authors, we here present
   three-dimensional evolutions of an older, larger, but less massive
   protostellar disk. We show that potentially long-lived condensations
   form only for the extreme of local isothermality, and then only when
   severe restrictions are placed on the natural tendency of the
   protostellar disk to expand in response to gravitational instabilities.
   A more realistic adiabatic evolution leads to vertical and radial
   expansion of the disk but no clump formation. We conclude that
   isothermal disk calculations cannot demonstrate companion formation by
   disk fragmentation but only suggest it at best. It will be necessary in
   future numerical work on this problem to treat the disk thermodynamics
   more realistically.}},

Abstract = {{Current hexahedral mesh generation techniques rely on a set of meshing
   tools, which when combined with geometry decomposition leads to an
   adequate mesh generation process. Of these tools, sweeping tends to be
   the workhorse algorithm, accounting for at least 50 per cent of most
   meshing applications. Constraints which must be met for a Volume to be
   sweepable are derived, and it is proven that these constraints are
   necessary but not sufficient conditions for sweepability. This paper
   also describes a new algorithm for detecting extruded or sweepable
   geometries. This algorithm, based on these constraints, uses topological
   and local geometric information, and is more robust than feature
   recognition-based algorithms. A method for computing sweep dependencies
   in volume assemblies is also given. The auto sweep detect and sweep
   grouping algorithms have been used to reduce interactive user time
   required to generate all-hexahedral meshes by filtering out
   non-sweepable volumes needing further decomposition and by allowing
   concurrent meshing of independent sweep groups. Parts of the auto sweep
   detect algorithm have also been used to identify independent sweep
   paths, for use in volume-based interval assignment. Published in 2000 by
   John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (maxi-K channels) are known
   to modulate uterine activity during gestation. Electrophysiological
   recordings demonstrate that myometrial maxi-K current is suppressed in
   term-pregnant compared to non-pregnant mice. We sought to determine
   whether maxi-K current suppression is due to reduction of maxi-K channel
   protein or differential expression of maxi-K channel isoforms that vary
   in their Ca2+ and voltage sensitivities. Immunoblot analyses show an
   increase of maxi-K channel protein throughout gestation. Polymerase
   chain reaction of mouse myometrial cDNA identified four alternatively
   spliced sites within the maxi-K transcript and three within the
   Ca2+-sensitive ``tail{''} domain. Ribonuclease protection analyses
   demonstrate that total channel transcript levels mimic protein
   expression; however transcript levels of alternatively spliced regions
   of regulatory domains that alter sensitivity to voltage and Ca2+ differ
   in their gestational expression. An insert that increases the maxi-K
   channel sensitivity to voltage and Ca2+ is present at steady levels
   throughout gestation, differing from total channel transcript
   regulation. The insert-less form of this transcript, which reduces the
   channel voltage and Ca2+ sensitivity, is not detected until midterm
   pregnancy. These findings verify that multiple isoforms of the maxi-K
   channel are present in the mouse myometrium and are regulated
   differentially during gestation, which is a likely mechanism for
   modulation of myometrial excitability during pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pancreatic involvement in AIDS is rarely mentioned in
   medical literature.
   Aims: To identify the main morphological patterns of the pancreas using
   optical and electron microscopy in AIDS patients.
   Design: An open, prospective, and sequential study in a tertiary
   institutional hospital.
   Methods: Consecutive post-mortems of 109 AIDS patients and 38 controls
   (1995). Baseline characteristics of AIDS patients and controls were
   evaluated. Morphological analysis consisted of: (i) semi-quantitative
   score of acinar and parenchymal elements; (ii) qualitative analysis of
   ducts, vascular components, nerves, and Langerhans' islets; (iii)
   specific stains and immunohistochemistry for opportunistic agents; (iv)
   ultrastructural data.
   Results: The mean age of AIDS patients was 37 years; 80\% were male;
   60\% were white; 210/0 were alcoholic. All patients with AIDS had normal
   blood amylase, blood glucose, and pancreatic ultrasound. Histological
   findings were: acinar atrophy (60\%), few zymogen granula in acinar
   cytoplasm (52\%), abnormalities in acinar nucleus (65\%), pancreatic
   steatosis (66\%), and focal necrosis (17\%). Immunohistochemistry
   revealed: mycobacteriosis (22\%), toxoplasmosis (13\%), cytomegalovirus
   (9\%), Pneumocystis carinii (9\%), and HIV p24 antigen in macropahge
   cytoplasm (22\%). Ultrastructural examination showed: decreased zymogen
   granula, enlargement and proliferation of the endoplasmic reticulum and
   mitochondria, nuclear abnormalities, and increased lipid droplets in
   acinar cytoplasm.
   Conclusion: Pancreatic involvement in AIDS is very frequent (90\%) and
   is usually asymptomatic. Morphological changes showed three patterns of
   pancreatic alterations: `nutritional-like', inflammatory and both of
   these together. The `nutritional-like' pattern (atrophy, few zymogen
   granula and steatosis) may be due to many factors such as nutritional
   characteristics (Kwashiorkor-like) induced by the HIV infection or
   related to the HIV virus itself. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams \&

Abstract = {{Efficient syntheses of A-ring synthons 24 and 32 are described from
   hydroxy ester 16, which is easily available on a preparative scale from
   (-)-quinic acid. Key features of the syntheses were (a) the ability to
   selectively perform desilylations in the presence of p-nitrobenzoate
   esters and (b) the excellent yield and complete stereospecificity with
   which the configuration of alcohols 16, 18, and 26 could be inverted

Abstract = {{A number of recent studies have examined the roles of charged amino acid
   residues in guiding protein association. Motivating these studies is the
   hypothesis that patterns of charged amino acid residues cooperate
   electrostatically to assist in orienting the interacting proteins,
   increasing the rate of association, This `electrostatic steering' effect
   is enhanced by decreasing the ionic strength in the surrounding solvent,
   and has been shown experimentally to raise the association rate
   coefficient several-fold. The present study employs a recent advance in
   the computational methodology of Brownian dynamics simulation to dissect
   the process of electrostatic stet:ring in two model systems. A dimeric
   hemoglobin, whose constituent monomer is predicted to dimerize rapidly,
   and the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation factor ARF-1 from rat,
   shown to dimerize only at high concentrations, were approximated as
   spheres and the effects of their respective patterns of surface charges
   on dimerization kinetics were compared. The hemoglobin charge pattern
   yielded higher association rate coefficients consistently than did that
   of ARF-I and the difference was especially pronounced when the charge
   patterns of each protein were applied to spheres the size of the other
   protein, In future work planned for this system, the detailed dissection
   of the roles of individual charges within the patterns on the surfaces
   of these proteins will indicate how the respective charge patterns
   dictate the observed association rates. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Anti-Mullerian hormone induces the regression of fetal Mullerian ducts
   and inhibits the transcription of gonadal steroidogenic enzymes. It
   belongs to the transforming growth factor-p family whose members signal
   through a pair of serine/threonine kinase receptors and Smad effecters.
   Only the anti-Mullerian hormone type II receptor has been identified.
   Our goal was to determine whether anti-Mullerian hormone could share a
   type I receptor with another family member. Co-immunoprecipitation of
   known type I receptors with anti-Mullerian hormone type II receptor
   clearly showed that the bone morphogenetic protein type LB receptor was
   the only cloned type I receptor interacting in a ligand-dependent manner
   with this type II receptor. Anti-Mullerian hormone also activates the
   bone morphogenetic protein-specific Smad1 pathway and the XVent2
   reporter gene, an anti-Mullerian hormone type II receptor-dependent
   effect abrogated by a dominant negative version of bone morphogenetic
   protein type LB receptor. Reverse amplification experiments showed that
   bone morphogenetic protein type IB receptor is co-expressed with
   anti-Mullerian hormone type II receptor in most anti-Mullerian hormone
   target tissues. Our data support a model in which a ligand,
   anti-Mullerian hormone, gains access to a shared type I receptor and
   Smad1 system through a highly restricted type II receptor.}},

   PriA protein, with a single-stranded (ss) DNA have been performed, using
   the quantitative fluorescence titration technique. The stoichiometry of
   the PriA helicase.ssDNA complex has been examined in binding experiments
   with a series of ssDNA oligomers. The total site-size of the PriA.ssDNA
   complex, i.e. the maximum number of nucleotide residues occluded by the
   PriA helicase in the complex, is 20 +/- 3 residues per protein monomer,
   However, the protein can efficiently form a complex with a minimum of 8
   nucleotides, Thus, the enzyme has a strong ssDNA-binding site that
   engages in direct interactions with a significantly smaller number of
   nucleotides than the total site-size, The ssDNA-binding site is located
   in the center of the enzyme molecule, with the protein matrix protruding
   over a distance of similar to 6 nucleotides on both sides of the binding
   site. The analysis of the binding of two PriA molecules to long
   oligomers was performed using statistical thermodynamic models that take
   into account the overlap of potential binding sites, cooperative
   interactions, and the protein.ssDNA complexes with different
   stoichiometries. The intrinsic affinity depends little upon the length
   of the ssDNA. Moreover, the binding is accompanied by weak cooperative

Abstract = {{Enthalpies of formation and enthalpies of reaction at 298 K for a set of
   fluorocarbon species derived from the pyrolysis of hexafluoropropylene
   oxide (HFPO) were computed using the B3LYP (Becke three-parameter
   Lee-Yang-Parr) density functional theory. Total energies were calculated
   at the B3LYP/6-311+G(3df )//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. Zero-point energies
   and thermal corrections were calculated using
   B3LYP/6-31G(d)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) vibrational frequencies scaled by a
   factor of 0.96. The average absolute deviation of enthalpies of
   formation and reaction were 2.33 and 1.42 kcal/mol, respectively. The
   pyrolysis of HFPO to produce difluorocarbene, CF2, and trifluoroacetyl
   fluoride, CF3CFO, was predicted to be endothermic at 23.6 kcal/mol. The
   singlet state of CF2 was predicted to be more stable than its triplet
   state by 52.4 kcal/mol. CF2 polymerization through the addition of a
   singlet CF2 to an existing unterminated chain was calculated to be more
   favorable than through the addition of a singlet CF2 to an existing
   perfluoroalkene molecule. For the former pathway, a linear relationship
   was found between the enthalpy of formation of the CF2 chains and the
   number of chain carbons (n) for n greater than or equal to 2. The
   reaction enthalpy for each successive CF2 extension was found to be
   -48.7 kcal/mol, and the carbon-carbon bond dissociation energy was found
   to be 75.5 kcal/mol. For the latter pathway, the stability of CF2=CF2
   hindered chain polymerization but provided theoretical support to
   CF2=CF2 as a primary product in HFPO pyrolysis experiments. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The general principles of a new concept of chemical analysis, called
   stoichiography, are represented. Stoichiography allows the
   reference-free analyzing of the molecular and phase composition of
   complex substances. The differential dissolving technique as a new
   stoichiography method was developed to characterize in detail the phase
   composition of heterogeneous catalysts and to identify known and
   absolutely unknown phases composing the catalyst. The analyzed phases
   may be in crystalline or amorphous state, which is of no importance for
   the analysis performance. Such phase analysis is performed with a high
   sensitivity and very fast. Equipment, developed specially for this
   analysis, is called stoichiograph. The advantages of differential
   dissolving in studying the phase composition of catalysts are
   demonstrated through many particular examples. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Electron microscopy and single-particle analyses have been carried out
   on negatively stained photosystem Il (PSII) complexes isolated from the
   green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the thermophilic cyanobacterium
   Synechococcus elongatus, The analyses have yielded three-dimensional
   structures at 30-Angstrom resolution. Biochemical analysis of the C.
   reinhardtii particle suggested it to be very similar to the
   light-harvesting complex II (LHCII)PSII supercomplex of spinach, a
   conclusion borne out by its three-dimensional structure. Not only was
   the C, reinhardtii LHCII PSII supercomplex dimeric and of comparable
   size and shape to that of spinach, but the structural features for the
   extrinsic OEC subunits bound to the lumenal surface were also similar
   thus allowing identification of the PsbO, PsbP, and Psba OEC proteins.
   The particle isolated from S. elongatus was also dimeric and retained
   its OEC proteins, PsbO, PsbU, and PsbV (cytochrome c(550)), which were
   again visualized as protrusions on the lumenal surface of the complex.
   The overall size and shape of the cyanobacterial particle was similar to
   that of a PSII dimeric core complex isolated from spinach for which
   higher resolution structural data are known from electron
   crystallography, By building the higher resolution structural model into
   the projection maps it has been possible to relate the positioning of
   the OEC proteins of C. reinhardtii and S. elongatus with the underlying
   transmembrane helices of other major intrinsic subunits of the core
   complex, D1, D2, CP47, and CP43 proteins. It is concluded that the PsbO
   protein is located over the CP47 and D2 side of the reaction center core
   complex, whereas the PsbP/PsbQ and PsbV/PsbU are positioned over the
   lumenal surface of the N-terminal region of the D1 protein. However, the
   mass attributed to PsbV/PsbU seems to bridge across to the PsbO, whereas
   the PsbP/PsbQ proteins protrude out more fi om the lumenal surface.
   Nevertheless, within the resolution and quality of the data, the
   relative positions of the center of masses for OEC proteins of C.
   reinhardtii and S. elongatus are similar and consistent with those
   determined previously for the OEC proteins of spinach.}},

Abstract = {{Dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), the first stable oxidation product of
   vitamin C, was transported by GLUT1 and GLUT3 in Xenopus laevis oocytes
   with transport rates similar to that of P-deoxyglucose (2-DG), but due
   to inherent difficulties with GLUT4 expression in oocytes it was
   uncertain whether GLUT4 transported DHA (Rumsey, S, C., Kwon, O., Xu, G.
   W., Burant, C. F., Simpson, I., and Levine, M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem.
   272, 18982-18989). We therefore studied DHA and 2-DG transport in rat
   adipocytes, which express GLUT4. Without insulin, rat adipocytes
   transported 2-DG 2-3-fold faster than DHA. Preincubation with insulin
   (0.67 mu M) increased transport of each substrate similarly: 7-10-fold
   for 2-DG and 6-8-fold for DHA, Because intracellular reduction of DHA in
   adipocytes was complete before and after insulin stimulation, increased
   transport of DHA was not explained by increased internal reduction of
   DHA to ascorbate, To determine apparent transport kinetics of GLUT4 for
   DHA, GLUT4 expression in Xenopus oocytes was reexamined. Preincubation
   of oocytes for >4 h with insulin (1 mu M) augmented GLUT4 transport of
   2-DG and DKA by up to 5-fold. Transport of both substrates was inhibited
   by cytochalasin B and displayed saturable kinetics. GLUT4 had a higher
   apparent transport affinity (K-m of 0.98 versus 5.2 mM) and lower
   maximal transport rate (V-max of 66 versus 880 pmol/oocyte/10 min) for
   DHA compared with 2-DG. The lower transport rate for DHA could not be
   explained by binding differences at the outer membrane face, as shown by
   inhibition with ethylidene glucose, or by transporter trans-activation
   and therefore was probably due to substrate-specific differences in
   transporter/substrate translocation or release. These novel data
   indicate that the insulin-sensitive transporter GLUT4 transports DHA in
   both rat adipocytes and Xenopus oocytes, Alterations of this mechanism
   in diabetes could have clinical implications for ascorbate utilization.}},

   effective binding of the active electron in the quasi-diatomic molecule
   formed during the course of collision is obtained for the first time: in
   an ab initio way. The electron translation factor (ETF) modified
   Born-Oppenheimer wave function is generated to obtain the adiabatic
   molecular states of the quasi-molecule (LiHe)(3+). A set of eight
   close-coupled . The equations is solved numerically to obtain both the
   partial and total capture cross-sections at 0.5 less than or equal to E
   less than or equal to 5 keV amu(-1) cross-sections are compared with
   both the low-energy measurements and other available theoretical
   results. The explicit n- and l-distributions of the capture
   cross-sections are also presented for the first time. Comparison is made
   with a recent calculation carried out in a similar manner for Li3+-H-2,
   another two-electron colliding system. The structureless ion of Li, as

Abstract = {{Nonstructural protein 3 (Nsp3) is an essential subunit of the alphavirus
   RNA replication complex, although its specific function(s) has yet to be
   well defined. Previously, it has been shown that Semliki Forest virus
   Nsp3 (482 amino acids) is a phosphoprotein, and, in the present study,
   we have mapped its major phosphorylation sites. Mass spectrometric
   methods utilized included precursor ion scanning, matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization mass spectrometry used in conjunction with
   on-target alkaline phosphatase digestions, and tandem mass spectrometry,
   Two-dimensional peptide mapping was applied to separate tryptic
   P-32-labeled phosphopeptides of Nsp3, Radiolabeled peptides were then
   subjected to Edman sequencing, and phosphoamino acid analysis. In
   addition, radiolabeled Nsp3 was cleaved successively with cyanogen
   bromide and trypsin, and microscale iron-chelate affinity chromatography
   was used to enrich phosphopeptides. By combining these methods, we
   showed that Nsp3 is phosphorylated on serine residues 320, 327, 332,
   335, 356, 359, 362, and 367, and is heavily phosphorylated on peptide
   Gly(338)-Lys(415), which carries 7-12 phosphates distributed over its 13
   potential phosphorylation sites. These analytical findings were
   corroborated by constructing a Nsp3 derivative devoid of
   phosphorylation, The results represent the first determination of
   phosphorylation sites of an alphavirus nonstructural protein, but the
   approach can be utilized in phosphoprotein analysis in general.}},

Abstract = {{Latrunculin A is used extensively as an agent to sequester monomeric
   actin in living cells. We hypothesize that additional activities of
   latrunculin A may be important for its biological activity. Our data are
   consistent with the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with an
   equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.2 to 0.4 mu M and provide no
   evidence that the actin-latrunculin A complex participates in the
   elongation of actin filaments. Profilin and latrunculin A bind
   independently to actin, whereas binding of thymosin beta(4) to actin is
   inhibited by latrunculin A. Potential implications of this differential
   effect on actin-binding proteins are discussed. From a structural
   perspective, if latrunculin A binds to actin at a site that sterically
   influences binding by thymosin beta(4), then the observation that
   latrunculin A inhibits nucleotide exchange on actin implies an
   allosteric effect on the nucleotide binding cleft. Alternatively, if, as
   previously postulated, latrunculin A binds in the nucleotide cleft of
   actin, then its ability to inhibit binding by thymosin beta(4) is a
   surprising result that suggests that significant allosteric changes
   affect the thymosin beta(4) binding site. We show that latrunculin A and
   actin form a crystalline structure with orthorhombic space group
   P2(1)2(1)2(1) and diffraction to 3.10 Angstrom. A high resolution
   structure with optimized crystallization conditions should provide
   insight regarding these remarkable allosteric properties.}},

Abstract = {{A non-isolated potentiostat suitable for the determination of
   electroactive species in electrically grounded metal-walled reactors is
   described. In these reactors, due to the large area of the container,
   the rest potential of the solution is virtually constant and cannot be
   controlled by immersing a relatively small counter electrode connected
   to a conventional potentiostat. Electroanalytical methods, therefore,
   can be performed in reactors only with an electrically well isolated
   potentiostat connected to a floating excitation signal generator and
   data processor. The non-isolated `grounded counter electrode'
   potentiostat offers a better solution; the metallic container serves as
   a counter electrode and the potential of the working electrode is
   adjusted to the sum of the excitation signal and the potential of the
   reference electrode located near the working electrode. This approach is
   also very useful in systems containing shielded electrodes whose
   potentials cannot be controlled by conventional multi-electrode
   potentiostats. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Neural networks with pruning were applied to model overlapped peaks
   obtained in differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) with modified carbon
   fibre electrode with TiO2 of binary mixtures of catechol and
   hydroquinone. The best condition for electrochemical response was
   obtained with 0.05 mol l(-1) Tris-HCl buffer at pH 6.0 and T-800 sized
   carbon fibre electrode. Initially the voltammograms were processed using
   Fourier transform filter and principal component analysis (PCA) to noise
   reduction and data compression, respectively. The scores of these
   principal components were the input into the neural network and the
   optimal brain surgeon (OBS) was the procedure employed for pruning the
   neural network. The results obtained with pruning procedure were
   slightly better in relation to hydroquinone in comparison to the PLS1
   and PLS2. However, the similar errors were obtained to catechol when
   using PLS or neural networks models. Using neural networks with pruning
   was possible to determine catechol and hydroquinone by DPV using carbon
   fibre electrode, in concentration range of 1.0 x 10(-4) up to 6.0x
   10(-4) mol l(-1) with root mean square errors of predictions (\%RMSEP)

Abstract = {{The effect of pH on the secretory transport of Cd through the intestinal
   brush border membrane was investigated using isolated rat intestinal
   brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) and the Caco-2 intestinal
   epithelial cell line. BBMV equilibrated at pH 5.5 or 7.5 (pH(m)) were
   mixed with an experimental buffer at pH 5.5 or 7.5 (pH(out)) containing
   CdCl2. The initial accumulation of Cd in BBMV incubated for 1 or 3 min
   at pH(in) 5.5 and pH(out) 7.5 (outwardly directed H+-gradient) was
   significantly higher than that at pH(in) = pH(out) = 7.5, but the
   equilibrated Cd accumulation incubated for 30 min was marginally lower.
   Carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), a
   protonophore, diminished the increasing effect of the H+-gradient on the
   initial Cd accumulation. Caco-2 cell monolayers cultured on permeable
   membranes were incubated with CdCl2 from the basolateral medium, and the
   transport of Cd from the basolateral to apical medium and the
   accumulation of Cd in the monolayers were measured. Cd transport was
   increased by lowering the pH of the apical medium, and was accompanied
   by a decrease in the Cd accumulation. Coincubation with CdCl2 and
   tetraethylammonium, a typical, substrate for H+-antiport of the renal
   organic cation transporter, from the basolateral medium slightly but
   significantly decreased the basolateral-to-apical transport of Cd, with
   a concomitant increase in the Cd accumulation. These findings suggest
   the secretory transport of Cd through the intestinal brush border
   membrane not only via passive diffusion but also via H+-antiport of the
   putative organic cation transporter. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland

Abstract = {{Early terrestrial ancestors of the land flora are characterized by a
   simple, axially symmetric habit and evolved in an atmosphere with much
   higher CO2 concentrations than today. In order to gain information about
   the ecophysiological interrelationships of these plants, a model dealing
   with their gaseous exchange, which is basic to transpiration and
   photosynthesis, is introduced. The model is based on gas diffusion
   inside a porous medium and on a well-established photosynthesis model
   and allows for the simulation of the local gas fluxes through the
   various tissue layers of a plant axis. Necessary parameters consist of
   kinetical properties of the assimilation process and other physiological
   parameters (which have to be taken from extant plants), as well as
   physical constants and anatomical parameters which can be obtained from
   well-preserved fossil specimens. The model system is applied to an Early
   Devonian land plant, Aglaophyton major. The results demonstrate that,
   under an Early Devonian CO2 concentration, A. major shows an extremely
   low transpiration rate and a low, but probably sufficiently high
   assimilation rate. Variation of the atmospheric CO2 concentration shows
   that the assimilation is fully saturated even if the CO2 content is
   decreased to about one-third of the initial value. This result indicates
   that A. major was probably able to exist under a wide range of
   atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Further applications of this model
   system to ecophysiological studies of early land plant evolution are
   discussed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{We have cloned the genomic sequence coding for the high mobility group 1
   (HMG1) protein in chickens. Multiple sequence alignment shows that the
   chicken HMG1 gene is highly homologous to the human and the mouse HMG1
   genes. The gene structure of chicken HMG1 is similar to that of the
   mouse and the human HMG1 genes, with the same exon-intron boundaries.
   However, in contrast to other avian genes that have shorter introns, the
   chicken HMG1 gene has introns that are twice as long as their mammalian
   homologues. In addition to the functional. intron-containing HMG1 gene,
   all mammalian genomes contain more than 50 copies of HMG1
   retropseudogenes each, while in the chicken genome there are no HMG1
   retropseudogenes. This finding suggests that the HMG1 retropseudogenes
   arose in mammals after their divergence away from the birds. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Both the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes are used extensively in
   studies of plant population genetics and systematics. In the majority of
   angiosperms, the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
   are each primarily transmitted maternally, but rare biparental
   transmission is possible. The extent to which the cpDNA and mtDNA are in
   linkage disequilibrium is argued to be dependent on the fidelity of
   co-transmission and the population structure. This study reports
   complete linkage disequilibrium between cpDNA and mtDNA haplotypes in 86
   individuals from 17 populations of Silene vulgaris, a gynodioecious
   plant species. Phylogenetic analysis of cpDNA and mtDNA haplotypes
   within 14 individuals supports a hypothesis that the evolutionary
   histories of the chloroplasts and mitochondria are congruent within S.
   vulgaris, as might be expected if this association persists for long
   periods. This provides the first documentation of the evolutionary
   consequences of long-term associations between chloroplast and
   mitochondrial genomes within a species. Factors that contribute to the
   phylogenetic and linkage associations, as well as the potential for
   intergenomic hitchhiking resulting from selection on genes in one
   organellar genome are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{CRAMP-18 (GEKLKKIGQKIKNFFQKL) is the antibacterial sequence derived from
   CRMAP, a member of cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptides. To
   develop the novel antibiotic peptides useful as therapeutic drugs
   requires strong antibiotic activity against bacterial and fungal cells
   without hemolytic effect. To this goal, the analogues were designed to
   increase only net positively charge by Lys-substitution of positions 2,
   9, 13, or 16 at the hydrophilic helix face of CRAMP-18 without any
   change at the hydrophobic helix face, in particular, Lys-substitution
   (K-2-CRAMP-18) of position 2 in CRAMP-18 induced the enhanced antibiotic
   activity without any increase in hemolysis. Thus, this peptide may
   provide a useful template for the design novel antibiotic peptides for
   the treatment of infectious diseases. Additional CD spectra studies
   suggested that the alpha-helical structure of the peptides plays an
   important role in killing bacterial and fungal cells, but the increase
   of ly-helical content is less connected with the enhanced antibiotic
   activity. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The (001) surface of silicon contains pairs of atoms that are held
   together with a strong sigma bond and a weak pi bond. The interaction of
   styrene with the Si(001) surface has been investigated as a model system
   for understanding the interaction of conjugated pi-electron systems to
   pi-bonded semiconductor surfaces. Scanning tunneling microscopy images
   show one primary bonding configuration, slightly off-center from the
   middle of a dimer row. Infrared spectra using isotopically labeled
   styrene establish that attachment occurs in a highly selective way,
   bonding through the external vinyl group and leaving the aromatic ring
   almost completely unperturbed. Ab initio calculations reveal that the
   interaction between the pi electrons of the vinyl group of styrene and
   the electron-deficient end of a Si=Si dimer is strongly attractive. It
   is proposed that this attraction facilitates a low-symmetry interaction
   between the surface dimers and the vinyl group, leading to a highly
   selective reaction pathway for which Woodward-Hoffmann rules do not
   apply. The implications for selective attachment of other conjugated
   pi-electron systems to other pi-bonded semiconductor surfaces are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus depletion was identified in high-cell-concentration fed-batch
   NSO myeloma cell cultures producing a humanized monoclonal antibody
   (MAb). In these cultures, the maximum viable and total cell
   concentration was generally ca. 5 x 10(9) and 7 x 10(9) cells/L,
   respectively, without phosphate feeding. Depletion of essential amino
   acids, such as lysine, was initially thought to cause the onset of cell
   death. However, further improvement of cell growth was not achieved by
   feeding a stoichiometrically balanced amino acid solution, which
   eliminated depletion of amino acids. Even though a higher cell viability
   was maintained for a longer period, no increase in total cell
   concentration was observed. Afterwards, phosphorus was found to be
   depleted in these cultures. By also feeding a phosphate solution to
   eliminate phosphorus depletion, the cell growth phase was prolonged
   significantly, resulting in a total cell concentration of ca. 17 x 10(9)
   cells/L, which is much greater than ca. 7 x 10(9) cells/L without
   phosphate feeding. The maximum viable cell concentration reached about
   10 x 10(9) cells/L, twice as high as that without phosphate feeding.
   Apoptosis was also delayed and suppressed with phosphate feeding. A
   nonapoptotic viable cell population of 6.5 x 10(9) cells/L, as compared
   with 3 x 10(9) cells/L without phosphate feeding, was obtained and
   successfully maintained for about 70 h. These results are consistent
   with the knowledge that phosphorus is an essential part of many cell
   components, including phospholipids, DNA, and RNA. As a result of
   phosphate feeding, a much higher integral of viable cell concentration
   over time was achieved, resulting in a correspondingly higher MAb titer
   of ca. 1.3 g/L. It was also noted that phosphate feeding delayed the
   cell metabolism shift from lactate production to lactate consumption
   typically observed in recombinant NSO cultures. The results highlight
   the importance of phosphate feeding in high-cell-concentration NSO
   cultures. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Juvenile hormone (JH) and serotonin (5-HT) were previously shown to
   enhance mictic (sexual) female production of the rotifer Brachionus
   plicatilis in batch cultures. To explore the basis of these effects,
   experiments were conducted on isolated individuals. JH treatment of
   maternal rotifers with 5 and 50 mu g ml(-1) (18.8 and 187.7 mu M)
   resulted in significantly higher (P < 0.05) mictic female production in
   the second (F-2) and third (F-3) generations. JH treatment was effective
   even at a lower food concentration of 7 x 10(5) cells ml(-1), but it was
   not effective when free ammonia was added at 2.4 and 3.1 mu g ml(-1).
   Mictic female production was not increased with exposure to 5-HT up to
   50 mu g ml(-1) (129.1 mu M) concentrations. When food level was reduced
   to 7x 10(5) cells ml(-1), however, 5-HT-treated rotifers produced
   significantly (P < 0.05) more mictic females than the control,
   particularly in F-3 generation. Mictic female production of 5-HT-treated
   rotifers did not differ from that of the control with or without free
   ammonia, but the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) of 5-HT-treated
   rotifers at 3.1 mu g ml(-1) free ammonia was significantly higher than
   the control. These results show that juvenile hormone increases mictic
   female production under optimum and sub-optimum food levels, whereas
   5-HT increases both mictic female production at low food level and
   population growth rate at high free ammonia concentrations. These
   compounds could he used to manage rotifer cultures and probe the
   mechanisms controlling the rotifer life cycle as it switches to mictic
   reproduction. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this preliminary study the feasibility of a modified spark source was
   investigated asa method of rapidly dissolving solid conductive samples
   in aqueous media prior to analysis by atomic spectroscopy. The spark
   source, originally designed for spark emission spectroscopy in air, was
   modified by the installation of a spark ablation vessel. This spark
   ablation vessel was designed for spark ablating samples in aqueous
   solution, such as deionised water. Samples such as mild steel and brass
   were ablated in 5-10 ml of deionised water for 2-30 s producing a
   colloidal suspension. The suspension was readily dissolved by adding 100
   mul of concentrated HCl or HNO3. In this paper the spark ablation vessel
   is described as well as some of the properties of spark ablation in
   aqueous solutions. Spark ablation rates on mild steel were measured with
   respect to spark ablation parameters such as applied current (power),
   polarity and spark time. Using mild steel as a test sample, spark
   ablation rates varied from 40 mug s(-1), with 2.5 A of applied current,
   to 70 mug s(-1) with 10 A of applied current to the electrodes. The
   feasibility of using this technique for analysing trace levels (mug
   g(-1)) of elements in solid samples was also demonstrated for elements
   such as Ni in brass with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
   (ICP-MS). Quantification of selected elements (Cr, Ni, Mn and Cu) in a
   certified alloy (SRM 663) and a non-certified stainless steel showed
   good agreement between the measured values using spark ablation and the
   accepted values. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conformational changes of alpha-mycolic acid (alpha-MA(MAI), isolated
   from Mycobacterium avium-M. intracellulare complex) in its monolayer at
   different surface pressures were investigated by using the
   Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
   Three representative monolayers that correspond to the gas,
   liquid-expanded, and solid states were prepared and transferred onto
   freshly cleaved mica. The monolayer LB films of alpha-MA(MAI) were
   examined by AFM in an angstrom resolution in the thickness direction.
   The observation of topography and cross section of the monolayers
   proposed a series of schematic pictures for the lateral arrangement of
   the alkyl chains of alpha-MA(MAI) in the monolayer at different surface
   pressures. The proposed molecular conformations were consistent with the
   surface pressure-area isotherm. The results suggested that the
   alpha-MA(MAI) molecules partially took a flat-on stance in the gas-state
   monolayer and that the full extension of the longer alkyl chain of the
   molecule in the monolayer was possible only when the monolayer was
   highly compressed to the solid state.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic properties of quasi-binary aqueous solutions of
   ethyl(hydroxyethyl)cellulose (EHEC) and the hydrophobically modified
   analogue (HM-EHEC) have been investigated with the PFG-SE NMR technique.
   By taking advantage of the phase behavior of the (HM-)EHEC solutions,
   different polymer fractions could be obtained by simply adjusting the
   temperature within the two-phase region and collecting the coexisting
   phases. We discuss the connection between phase behavior, microphase
   structure, polymer structure, and polymer dynamics by following the
   self-diffusion of polymers in these fractions as a function of
   concentration and temperature. By extrapolating the diffusion
   coefficient to infinite dilution, we observe a significant difference in
   hydrodynamic radius between the separated fractions. The width of the
   distribution of diffusion coefficients is used to recognize differences
   in associative behavior of the different polymer fractions. The echo
   decays of highly associative fractions show, in addition to the
   characteristic curved echo decay commonly observed in solutions of
   associative polymers, a single diffusing component with a very slow
   diffusion coefficient (D similar to 10(-14) m(2) s(-1)).}},

   microspheres are one modality of controlled delivery of biologically
   active molecules that would further the development of engineered
   tissues. As a possible mechanism to stimulate angiogenesis within an
   engineered tissue, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bovine
   serum albumin (BSA) were coencapsulated into microspheres fabricated
   from PEG and 50/50 PLGA using a
   solidencapsulation/single-emulsion/solvent extraction technique. Two
   VEGF/BSA ratios were studied: 1:2000 and 1:10,000. Analysis consisted of
   the loading efficiency, particle size distribution, bright-field
   microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, release kinetics, and an in
   vitro human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation assay to
   assess biological activity of the released VEGF. Results show the
   microspheres could be manufactured, stored, and degraded over 28 days.
   The burst release rates for 1:2000 and 1:10,000 VEGF/BSA microspheres
   were 71.87 +/- 8.11 and 27.91 +/- 1.71 ng/mL (mean +/- standard error of
   the mean), respectively; steady-state release rates were 6.56 +/- 1.10
   and 2.21 +/- 0.47 ng/mL, respectively. The microspheres released
   biologically active VEGF, and the VEGF increased the proliferation of
   HUVECs in culture (p < .05). The successful development of a novel,
   cost-effective, scalable technique for producing microspheres loaded
   with biologically active proteins is presented. Using the data obtained
   from these studies, a defined concentration of microspheres will deliver
   a quantifiable level of VEGF at a known release rate. (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{Owing to the capability of fabricating a well-defined chemical structure
   on the surface, self-assembled alkanethiols with a variety of terminal
   functionalities were prepared on the gold substrate for investigating
   the interactions between the biological environment and synthetic
   surface. In this study, we report the synthesis of the sulfonic acid
   terminated long-chain alkanethiol, 10-mercaptodecane-sulfonic acid, for
   direct preparation of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) with -SO3H
   functionality. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and elemental analysis
   studies indicated that a high purity of sulfonic acid terminated
   alkanethiol was obtained. Surface characterization results showed that
   the -SO3H terminated SAM is hydrophilic and has a slightly higher
   hysteresis value, possibly because of the slower chain mobility of the
   bound sulfonic acid alkanethiol. Electron spectroscopy for chemical
   analysis (ESCA) analysis demonstrated that the -SO3H terminal group is
   situated in the outermost layer of the monolayer, as previous
   alkanethiol SAM structure models proposed. The platelet reactivity of
   the -SO3H SAM was higher than that of -OH SAM but less than the -CH3
   terminated one in vitro, whereas similar platelet reactivity was noticed
   between the -SO3H and -COOH SAMs. The higher platelet reactivity found
   on the -SO3H SAM could be caused by the higher surface functional group
   density inherent in the SAM structure and/or the composition and
   conformation state of the adsorbed protein layer. (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

   alpha-synuclein, like A53T, contains a threonine residue at position 53.
   We have assessed the conformational properties and fibrillogenicity of
   the murine protein. Like WT and the two PD mutants, mouse
   alpha-synuclein adopts a ``natively unfolded{''} or disordered
   structure. However, at elevated concentrations, the mouse protein forms
   amyloid fibrils more rapidly than WT, A53T, or A30P. The fibrillization
   of mouse a-synuclein is slowed by WT and A53T. Inhibition of
   fibrillization leads to the accumulation of nonfibrillar, potentially
   toxic oligomers. The results are relevant to the interpretation of the
   phenotypes of transgenic animal models of PD and suggest a novel
   approach for testing the cause and effect relationship between
   fibrillization and neurodegeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase CRT)
   is a putative source of the genomic hypermutation that promotes rapid
   evolution of HIV-1. To understand the molecular strategies that create a
   highly mutagenic DNA polymerase active site in HIV-1 RT, we investigated
   the roles of four residues in the beta 8-alpha E loop. Gln151, which
   interacts with the sugar of the incoming dNTP, and Lys154, which
   interacts with the template, yielded site-directed mutants with
   increased fidelity, suggesting that these residues are directly involved
   in the mutagenic architecture of the active site. Mutations at GIn151
   and Lys154 also reduced processivity. Q151N RT showed enhanced ability
   to discriminate between TTP and AZT triphosphate, consistent with the
   observation that the Q151M mutation confers AZT resistance in vivo.
   Mutations at Gly152 greatly decreased RT activity; molecular modeling
   suggests that Gly152 is critical for the proper geometric alignment that
   permits base-paring of the incoming dNTP with the template. Mutations at
   Trp153 reduced the expression level, and presumably the stability, of RT
   proteins in bacteria. These observations support the conclusion that
   interactions of active site residues in the beta 8-alpha E loop with
   incoming dNTPs and the template are determinants of the accuracy,
   processivity, and substrate selectivity of HIV-1 RT.}},

   (Ib)), in which two dinuclear complexes are joined by a sulfur-sulfur
   bond, reacts with the electron-rich nitrogen heterocycles pyrroles and
   indoles at room temperature. The reactions involve heterolytic scission
   of the disulfide bond by the nucleophiles followed by proton transfer,
   and the products are {[}(Cp'Mo)(2)(S2CH2)(mu-S)(mu-SH)]BF4 (2) and
   {[}(Cp'MoS)(2)(S2CH2)(mu-S)(mu-S-pyrrolyl)]BF4 (3-6). The reactions have
   been characterized for pyrrole, 1-methylpyrrole, 1,2,5-trimethylpyrrole,
   and 1-methylindole. The regiochemistry of the reactions depends on
   pyrrole substituents. Complex 1 also reacts readily with the coordinated
   pyrrolyl ligand in (PMe2Ph)(3)Cl2Re(NC4H4). The electrophilic
   substitution occurs on the 3-position of the hetero cycle to form
   {[}(Cp'Mo)(2)(S2CH2)(mu-S)(mu-SC4H3N)ReCl2(PMe2Ph)(3)]BF4 (7). Complex 7
   undergoes a further reaction with 1 to give the hydrogen abstraction
   product {[}(Cp'Mo)(2)(S2CH2)(mu-S2C4H2N)ReCl2(PMe2Ph)(3)]BF4 (8). An
   X-ray diffraction study of 8b confirms that the 3- and 4-carbons of the
   pyrrolyl ligand are coordinated to the mu-sulfido ligands of the
   molybdenum dimer. The new products suggest that there are a number of
   ways in which electron-rich heterocycles might interact with a sulfided
   molybdenum catalyst in the hydrodenitrogenation reactions. Reactions of
   1 with other nucleophiles have also been surveyed.}},
