Abstract = {{In this work, the interaction energy term of the Sanchez-Lacombe
   equation of state (SL EOS) was modified to take into account the
   temperature dependence of hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions. A
   simple function was used in the form of the Langmuir equation that
   reduces to the original SL EOS at high temperature. Comparisons are
   shown between the epsilon{*}-modified SL EOS and the original SL EOS.
   The epsilon{*}-modified SL EOS could represent volumetric data for the
   group of non-polar fluids, polar fluids and ionic liquids to within an
   absolute average deviation (MD) of 0.85\%, 0.51\%, and 0.054\%,
   respectively whereas. the original Sanchez-Lacombe EOS gave MD values of
   0.99\%, 1.2\%, and 0.21\%, respectively. The epsilon{*}-modified SL EOS
   provides remarkably better PVT representation and can be readily applied
   to mixtures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mode-locked fiber lasers are currently undergoing a significant
   evolution towards higher pulse energies and shorter pulse durations. A
   key enabler in this progress has been the discovery of novel saturable
   absorbers (SA) such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene. The
   exceptional properties of CNTs as SA have been extensively studied in
   recent years. Graphene, a one atom thick planar sheet of carbon atoms
   arranged into a hexagonal lattice, has been recently proposed as an
   alternative to CNTs in several photonics applications. Here, we propose
   a method for the integration of graphene into a fiber ferrule using an
   optical deposition technique, which has been also employed for the
   deposition of CNT directly on the core of a fiber edge and in tapered
   fibers. We investigate and compare the optical properties of CNT-SA and
   graphene-SA fabricated by this optical deposition technique.
   Soliton-like, mode-locked lasing is confirmed using an erbium doped
   optical fiber in an all-fiber ring cavity laser configuration. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Photoreduction of ionic platinum or gold into metallic nanoparticles on
   the surface of a new type of porous metal oxide material was done from
   aqueous solutions of the metal salts. The metallization patterns were
   investigated in an effort to understand the photo activity and
   electronic properties of new semiconductor materials. In this study,
   KTiNbO5 and KNb3O8 were used as starting compounds, and colloids were
   derived via their chemical exfoliation. The colloids consist of
   individual lamellar particles that retain their crystallinity from the
   parent compounds. The colloids were agglomerated into highly porous
   framework solids. The synthesis provides a low temperature route to
   stable, porous, polycrystalline materials. Elemental analyses, scanning
   electron microscopy, and optical absorbance measurements were done to
   characterize the porous substrates and the metal deposition kinetics.
   Compared to the gold deposition, the platinum metal nanoparticles were
   deposited as smaller more widely dispersed islands on the surface of the
   photocatalysts. The rate of gold deposition was much faster than the
   platinum and the deposited gold particles were in the 50-400 nm diameter
   range, with most diameters near 100 nm. The diameters of the particles
   of platinum varied between 10 and 200 nm, but most were 50 nm or less.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we theoretically analyze and demonstrate that spectral
   efficiency of a conventional direct detection based optical OFDM system
   (DDO-OFDM) can be improved significantly using frequency interleaving of
   adjacent DDO-OFDM channels where OFDM signal band of one channel
   occupies the spectral gap of other channel and vice versa. We show that,
   at optimum operating condition, the proposed technique can effectively
   improve the spectral efficiency of the conventional DDO-OFDM system as
   much as 50\%. We also show that such a frequency interleaved DDO-OFDM
   system, with a bit rate of 48 Gb/s within 25 GHz bandwidth, achieves
   sufficient power budget after transmission over 25 km single mode fiber
   to be used in next-generation time-division-multiplexed passive optical
   networks (TDM-PON). Moreover, by applying 64-quadrature amplitude
   modulation (QAM), the system can be further scaled up to 96 Gb/s with a

   approximately 70\% conversion after 14 h of annealing. An absorption
   frequency of the TO-phonon mode that varies systematically with the
   substoichiometry of the silicon oxide in the 1046-1170 cm(-1) region was
   observed, revealing the reactivity of the film with the annealing time.
   For similar annealing time, films deposited on mono-crystalline silicon
   substrate remained mainly amorphous with minimal Si-crystalline
   formation. Therefore, the crystalline formations and the shape of the
   films surfaces depends on the annealing time as well as on the substrate
   employed during the deposition process of the a-Si:H film. (c) 2010

Title = {{Measurement invariance of the kidney disease and quality of life
   instrument (KDQOL-SF) across Veterans and non-Veterans}},
Journal = {{HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Studies have demonstrated that perceived health-related
   quality of life (HRQOL) of patients receiving hemodialysis is
   significantly impaired. Since HRQOL outcome data are often used to
   compare groups to determine health care effectiveness it is imperative
   that measures of HRQOL are valid. However, valid HRQOL comparisons
   between groups can only be made if instrument invariance is
   demonstrated. The Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form (KDQOL-SF)
   is a widely used HRQOL measure for patients with chronic kidney disease
   (CKD) however, it has not been validated in the Veteran population.
   Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the measurement
   invariance of the KDQOL-SF across Veterans and non-Veterans with CKD.
   Methods: Data for this study were from two large prospective
   observational studies of patients receiving hemodialysis: 1) Veteran
   End-Stage Renal Disease Study (VETERAN) (N = 314) and 2) Dialysis
   Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) (N = 3,300). Health-related
   quality of life was measured with the KDQOL-SF, which consists of the
   SF-36 and the Kidney Disease Component Summary (KDCS). Single-group
   confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of
   the hypothesized measurement model for responses to the subscales of the
   KDCS and SF-36 instruments when analyzed together; and given acceptable
   goodness-of-fit in each group, multigroup CFA was used to compare the
   structure of this factor model in the two samples. Pattern of factor
   loadings (configural invariance), the magnitude of factor loadings
   (metric invariance), and the magnitude of item intercepts (scalar
   invariance) were assessed as well as the degree to which factors have
   the same variances, covariances, and means across groups (structural
   invariance).
   Results: CFA demonstrated that the hypothesized two-factor model (KDCS
   and SF-36) fit the data of both the Veteran and DOPPS samples well,
   supporting configural invariance. Multigroup CFA results concerning
   metric and scalar invariance suggested partial strict invariance for the
   SF-36, but only weak invariance for the KDCS. Structural invariance was
   not supported.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that Veterans may interpret the KDQOL-SF
   differently than non-Veterans. Further evaluation of measurement
   invariance of the KDQOL-SF between Veterans and non-Veterans is needed
   using large, randomly selected samples before comparisons between these
   two groups using the KDQOL-SF can be done reliably.}},

   amount, sintering temperature, and sintering time were optimized by
   analyzing the crystal structure, relative density, and morphology for a
   series of as-sintered BCY20 ceramic pellets. High-quality,
   fully-densified BCY20 ceramic pellets were successfully prepared using
   1.0 wt.\% NiO loading at a sintering temperature of 1400 degrees C for
   12 h. In order to examine the fate of the NiO addition in the
   as-fabricated (oxidized) pellets and under reducing conditions, the
   microstructure of several as-sintered and reduced BCY20 ceramic pellets
   were investigated in detail by EDS mapping and compared with as-sintered
   and reduced control BCY20 ceramic pellets obtained from polymeric
   sol-gel powder. Upon reduction, nanosized nickel particles were
   accumulated in grain boundary regions of the NiO-modified BCY20 pellets,
   while Y2O3 second-phase impurities were identified in the sol-gel BCY20
   control pellets. The conductivities of both the NiO-modified SSRS and
   sol-gel control BCY20 ceramic pellets were investigated from 150 to 650
   degrees C under H2O saturated (PH2O-0.025 atm) atmospheres of UHP Ar and

Abstract = {{The longitudinal asymmetry induced by parity-violating (PV) components
   in the nucleon-nucleon potential is studied in the charge-exchange
   reaction He-3((n) over right arrow, p)H-3 at vanishing incident neutron
   energies. An expression for the PV observable is derived in terms of
   T-matrix elements for transitions from the L-2S+1(J) = S-1(0) and S-3(1)
   states in the incoming n-He-3 channel to states with J = 0 and 1 in the
   outgoing p-H-3 channel. The T-matrix elements involving PV transitions
   are obtained in first-order perturbation theory in the hadronic
   weak-interaction potential, while those connecting states of the same
   parity are derived from solutions of the strong-interaction Hamiltonian
   with the hyperspherical-harmonics method. The coupled-channel nature of
   the scattering problem is fully accounted for. Results are obtained
   corresponding to realistic or chiral two-and three-nucleon
   strong-interaction potentials in combination with either the DDH or
   pionless EFT model for the weak-interaction potential. The asymmetries,
   predicted with PV pion and vector-meson coupling constants corresponding
   (essentially) to the DDH ``best values{''} set, range from -9.44 to
   -2.48 in units of 10(-8), depending on the input strong-interaction
   Hamiltonian. This large model dependence is a consequence of
   cancellations between long-range (pion) and short-range (vector-meson)
   contributions and is of course sensitive to the assumed values for the
   PV coupling constants.}},

Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{Rich-club, assortativity and clustering coefficients are frequently used
   measures to estimate topological properties of complex networks. Here we
   find that the connectivity among a very small portion of the richest
   nodes can dominate the assortativity and clustering coefficients of a
   large network, which reveals that the rich-club connectivity is
   leveraged throughout the network. Our study suggests that more attention
   should be paid to the organization pattern of rich nodes, for the
   structure of a complex system as a whole is determined by the
   associations between the most influential individuals. Moreover, by
   manipulating the connectivity pattern in a very small rich-club, it is
   sufficient to produce a network with desired assortativity or
   transitivity. Conversely, our findings offer a simple explanation for
   the observed assortativity and transitivity in many real world
   networks-such biases can be explained by the connectivities among the
   richest nodes.}},

Abstract = {{The actin cross-linking protein filamin A (FLNa) functions as a
   scaffolding protein and couples cell cytoskeleton to extracellular
   matrix and integrin receptor signaling. In this study, we report that
   FLNa suppresses invasion of breast cancer cells and regulates focal
   adhesion (FA) turnover. Two large progression tissue microarrays from
   breast cancer patients revealed a significant decrease of FLNa levels in
   tissues from invasive breast cancer compared with benign disease and in
   lymph node-positive compared with lymph node-negative breast cancer. In
   breast cancer cells and orthotopic mouse breast cancer models,
   down-regulation of FLNa stimulated cancer cell migration, invasion, and
   metastasis formation. Time-lapse microscopy and biochemical assays after
   FLNa silencing and rescue with wild-type or mutant protein resistant to
   calpain cleavage revealed that FLNa regulates FA disassembly at the
   leading edge of motile cells. Moreover, FLNa down-regulation enhanced
   calpain activity through the mitogen-activated protein
   kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade and stimulated the
   cleavage of FA proteins. These results document a regulation of FA
   dynamics by FLNa in breast cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{12Cr-Ni stainless steels containing different carbon contents from 0.004
   wt.\% to 0.034 wt.\% were hot-rolled and air-cooled. Their corresponding
   microstructures were observed with optical microscope and transmission
   electron microscope, and the Vickers hardness, tensile and impact tests
   were also carried out. It was found that the martensitic morphology was
   significantly influenced by carbon content. The as-received ultra low
   carbon martensite in the steel containing 0.004 wt.\% C is characterized
   by dislocation cells substructure. The formation of dislocation cells is
   attributed to high martensite finishing point (above 400 degrees C) and
   low interstitial atoms content. On the other hand, the martensite in the
   steel containing 0.034 wt.\% C consists mainly of typical martensite
   laths because of low martensite finishing point and high interstitial
   atoms content which hinder dislocation motion. Furthermore, carbon
   content has an evident effect on the mechanical properties of 12Cr-Ni
   steels. The hardness and strength of the as-received steels increase
   with an increase in carbon content, but their elongation and impact
   toughness decrease with the carbon content. The steel containing 0.004
   wt.\% C has excellent impact toughness due to the ultra low carbon
   content in the martensite composed of dislocation cells. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{Aluminum doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) films were reactively sputtered at a
   high discharge power from dual rotating metallic targets (Zn:Al =
   99.5:0.5 wt.\%). Deposition conditions like substrate temperature and
   working points were varied in order to prepare high quality ZnO:Al
   films. The influences on electrical and optical ZnO:Al thin film
   properties and surface texture before and after chemical etching in
   diluted HCl were studied in order to achieve light scattering films as
   front contact for solar cells. High dynamic deposition rate close to 90
   nm m/min and high Hall mobility of up to 47 cm(2)/Vs were obtained.
   Transmission of more than 85\% in the visible spectral range is obtained
   for all ZnO:Al films in this study. In addition, the absorption in near
   infrared region is low due to low doping. Surface texture after etching
   is usually much rougher than before. However, some films reveal after
   etching small surface features that are similar to initial surface
   features. We propose a relationship between initial and post-etched
   surface textures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis is a major cause of ocular
   morbidity and may lead to visual loss. Adenovirus types 8, 19, and 37
   may cause epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. The main objective of this
   study was to determine the types of adenoviruses causing
   keratoconjunctivitis in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: We conducted a non-interventional observational clinical study.
   Seventy three eyes from 65 patients who presented to The Eye Center in
   Riyadh, Saudi Arabia with clinical features of acute adenoviral
   keratoconjunctivitis were included. Each patient underwent complete
   clinical examination and features such as membranous reaction,
   conjunctival hemorrhage, subepithelial corneal infiltrates, and
   preauricular lymph node enlargement were recorded. Conjunctival swabs
   were obtained from patients with presumed acute viral conjunctivitis.
   Immunochromatography (IC) and restriction fragment length polymorphism
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR-RFLP) were performed on the conjunctival
   swabs obtained from each eye. Serotype identification was performed
   using direct sequencing technique.
   Results: Forty-nine (67.1\%) were adenovirus type 8, 8 (11.0\%) were
   adenovirus type 3, 6 (8.2\%) type 37, 5 (6.8\%) were adenovirus type 4,
   and 2 (2.3\%) type 19. The remaining 5 were types 14, 19, and 22. The
   prevalence of membranous conjunctivitis was highest (83\%) among eyes
   with adenovirus type 37 while subepithelial corneal opacities were most
   commonly seen among eyes with adenovirus type 8 (47\%).
   Immunochromatography tests were positive for adenovirus in 48 (65.7\%)
   out of 73 eyes.
   Conclusions: This study determined the types of adenoviruses causing
   keratoconjunctivitis at one center in Saudi Arabia. Direct sequencing
   techniques is an efficient, accurate, and rapid means of diagnosing
   adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. The most common causes of adenoviral
   keratoconjunctivitis in Saudi Arabia were adenovirus types 8, 3, and 37.
   Membranous conjunctivitis and subepithelial opacities had the highest
   frequency of adenovirus types 37 and 8, respectively. Lymph nodes
   enlargement was least likely in adenovirus type 4.}},

Abstract = {{Learned bird songs evolve via cultural evolution, with song patterns
   transmitted across generations by imitative learning. In Darwin's
   finches of the Galapagos Islands, males learn songs from their fathers,
   and song types can be maintained across multiple generations. However,
   little is known about the time frame over which specific song types are
   preserved, in the face of copy errors and corresponding modifications to
   song structure. Here we investigate cultural evolution in songs of male
   Geospiza fortis, at Academy Bay, Santa Cruz Island, comparing songs
   recorded in 1961 by R. Bowman (20 individuals) to those recorded in 1999
   by J. Podos (16 individuals). For each individual, we characterized four
   timing and six frequency parameters, and assessed inter-individual
   variation in song structure using multivariate analysis. Several 1961
   song types persisted into 1999, some with remarkable fidelity. Variation
   among song types was extensive during both years, and we detected no
   changes in 10 vocal parameters across the sampling period. These results
   illustrate temporal continuity in a culturally acquired trait, and raise
   questions about mechanisms that promote stability in song structure.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},

Abstract = {{The K-a band radar imaging mechanism of the submerged wreck/sand ribbon
   of the motor vessel (M/V) Birkenfels in the southern North Sea is
   investigated by applying the quasi-specular scattering theory and
   considering the capillary as well as the gravity wave ranges of the wave
   energy density spectrum. For the imaging of wrecks and other
   oceanographic and meteorological phenomena at the sea surface it is
   assumed that quasi-specular scattering becomes dominant at higher radar
   frequencies like K-a and X band and wind speeds > 7-8 m s(-1). Multibeam
   echo sounder images of the Birkenfels wreck and associated sand ribbons
   as well as other available environmental in situ data have been
   analyzed. The formation of sand ribbons at the sea bed and the
   manifestation of its radar signatures at the water surface are caused by
   an elliptical vortex or helical flow cell triggered by unidirectional
   tidal current flow interacting with the wreck. The difference between
   simulated and measured normalized radar cross section (NRCS) modulation
   as a function of the space variable is less than 31.6\%. Results are
   presented for NRCS simulations dependent on position for different
   effective incidence angles, unidirectional current speeds, wind speeds,
   and relaxation rates. The calculated current gradient or strain rate of
   the imaging theory has the same order of magnitude as those obtained for
   marine sand waves. This implies that the responsible hydrodynamic
   interaction mechanism is able to produce radar signatures of submerged
   wrecks/sand ribbons and make them visible at the sea surface.}},

Title = {{Narwhals document continued warming of southern Baffin Bay}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{We report on wintertime data collected from Baffin Bay and northern
   Davis Strait, a major gateway linking the Arctic with the subpolar North
   Atlantic, using narwhals (Monodon monoceros) as an oceanographic
   sampling platform. Fourteen narwhals were instrumented with
   satellite-linked time-depth-temperature recorders between 2005 and 2007.
   Transmitters collected and transmitted water column temperature profiles
   from each dive between December and April, where >90\% of maximum daily
   dive depths reached the bottom. Temperature measurements were combined
   with 15 helicopter-based conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) casts
   taken in April 2007 across central Baffin Bay and compared with
   hydrographic climatology values used for the region in Arctic climate
   models. Winter temperature maxima for whale and CTD data were in good
   agreement, ranging between 4.0 degrees C and 4.6 degrees C in inshore
   and offshore Baffin Bay and in Davis Strait. The warm Irminger Water was
   identified between 57 degrees W and 59 degrees W (at 68 degrees N)
   between 200 and 400 m depths. Whale data correlated well with
   climatological temperature maxima; however, they were on average 0.9
   degrees C warmer +/- 0.6 degrees C (P < 0.001). Furthermore, climatology
   data overestimated the winter surface isothermal layer thickness by
   50-80 m. Our results suggest the previously documented warming in Baffin
   Bay has continued through 2007 and is associated with a warmer West
   Greenland Current in both of its constituent water masses. This research
   demonstrates the feasibility of using narwhals as ocean observation
   platforms in inaccessible Arctic areas where dense sea ice prevents
   regular oceanographic measurements and where innate site fidelity,
   affinity for winter pack ice, and multiple daily dives to >1700 m offer
   a useful opportunity to sample the area.}},

Abstract = {{The use of steroid hormones as growth promoters in cattle has been
   banned within the European Union since 1988 but can still be
   fraudulently employed in animal breeding farms for anabolic purposes If
   an efficient monitoring of synthetic compounds (screening and
   confirmation) is ensured today by many laboratories, pointing out
   suspicious samples from a natural steroids abuse remains a tricky
   challenge clue to the difficulty to set relevant threshold levels for
   these endogenous compounds The development of focused profiling or
   untargeted metabolomic approaches is then emerging in this context, with
   the objective to reveal potential biomarkers signing an exogenous
   administration of such natural steroids This study aimed to assess
   sample preparation procedures based on microextraction and adapt them to
   high throughput urinary profiling or metabolomic analyses based on gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry measurement. Two techniques have been
   tested and optimised, namely solid phase microextraction (SPME) and
   microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS). using five model steroid
   metabolites (16 alpha-hydroxyandrosterone, 2 alpha-hydroxytestosterone,
   11-keto,5 beta-androstanedione, 6 alpha-hydroxyestradiol and 7
   beta-hydroxypregnenolone). The considered performance criteria included
   not only the absolute response of the targeted compounds but also the
   robustness of the materials, and the global aspect of the diagnostic ion
   chromatograms obtained. After only five successive urinary extractions,
   a clear degradation of the SPME fiber was observed which led to discard
   this method as a relevant technique for profiling, whereas no
   degradation was observed on MEPS sorbent. Repeatability and recovery
   yields were calculated from urine samples fortified at 500 mu g L-1 and
   extracted by MEPS. They were found respectively below 11\% and above
   60\% for all model compounds Detection limits were in the 5-15 mu g L-1
   range depending on the compounds, and a good linearity was observed on
   the 10-75 mu g L-1 range (R-2 > 0 99) This methodology was applied on
   urine samples collected from control versus androstenedione-treated
   bovines, revealing a significant concentration increase for several
   well-known metabolites such as etiocholanolone, 5 alpha-androstane-3
   beta, 17 alpha-diol, 5 beta-androstane-3 alpha, 17 alpha-diol and
   5-androstene-3 beta, 17 alpha-diol Finally, these results allowed to
   confirm the suitability of the developed strategy and give to this new
   MEPS application a promising interest in the field of GC-MS based

Abstract = {{Hexagonal-shaped ZnO nanorods were successfully grown on p-silicon

   FESEM, HRTEM and room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.
   It is confirmed from the observed structural and optical properties,
   that the grown nanorods are well-crystalline with the wurtzite hexagonal
   phase and are preferentially grown along the {[}0 0 0 1] direction and
   exhibiting good optical properties. The as-grown n-ZnO nanorods on
   p-silicon (n-ZnO/p-Si) substrate were used to fabricate p-n
   heterojunction diode which attains a turn-on voltage of similar to 0.5
   V. Temperature-dependant (298, 323, 343, 363, 383, and 423 K) I-V
   characteristics for the fabricated diode were also examined and
   demonstrated in this paper. It was found that the fabricated
   heterojunction diode was reasonably stable at higher temperatures and
   the series resistance slightly increases with increasing the

Abstract = {{The BiFe0.95Mn0.05O3 (BFMO) thin films were deposited on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si
   substrates using a metal organic decomposition process combined with a

   min/layer exhibits a much larger remanent polarization (P-r similar to
   81 mu C/cm(2)), a lower coercive field (E-c similar to 178 kV/cm), as
   well as stronger charge-retaining ability and fatigue resistance in
   comparison with that annealed for 2 min/layer, demonstrating that
   prolonging the annealing time can favor the improvement of the
   ferroelectric properties of BFMO film. These results are discussed based
   on the phase transition as well as the formation of defect complexes
   between oxygen vacancies and acceptors during the annealing treatment.

   coordinated post-translational modifications. In this study, we describe
   a novel mechanism controlling the persistence of the transcription
   factor ATF4 by multisite phosphorylation. Proline-directed
   phosphorylation acted additively to regulate multiple aspects of ATF4
   degradation. Stabilized ATF4 mutants exhibit decreased beta-TrCP degron
   phosphorylation, beta-TrCP interaction, and ubiquitination, as well as
   elicit early G(1) arrest. Expression of stabilized ATF4 also had
   significant consequences in the developing neocortex. Mutant ATF4
   expressing cells exhibited positioning and differentiation defects that
   were attributed to early G(1) arrest, suggesting that neurogenesis is
   sensitive to ATF4 dosage. We propose that precise regulation of the ATF4
   dosage impacts cell cycle control and impinges on neurogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Electron injection from the source-drain electrodes limits the
   performance of many n-type organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),
   particularly those based on organic semiconductors with electron
   affinities less than 3.5 eV. Here, it is shown that modification of gold
   source-drain electrodes with an overlying solution-deposited, patterned
   layer of an n-type metal oxide such as zinc oxide (ZnO) provides an
   efficient electron-injecting contact, which avoids the use of unstable
   low-work-function metals and is compatible with high-resolution
   patterning techniques such as photolithography. Ambipolar light-emitting
   field-effect transistors (LEFETs) based on green-light-emitting
   poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) and
   blue-light-emitting poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (F8) with
   electron-injecting gold/ZnO and hole-injecting gold electrodes show
   significantly lower electron threshold voltages and several orders of
   magnitude higher ambipolar currents, and hence light emission
   intensities, than devices with bare gold electrodes. Moreover, different
   solution-deposited metal oxide injection layers are compared. By
   spin-coating ZnO from a low-temperature precursor, processing
   temperatures could be reduced to 150 degrees C. Ultraviolet
   photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) shows that the improvement in
   transistor performance is due to reduction of the electron injection
   barrier at the interface between the organic semiconductor and ZnO/Au
   compared to bare gold electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic changes in neuronal morphology and transcriptional regulation
   play crucial roles in the neuronal network and function. Accumulating
   evidence suggests that the megakaryoblastic leukemia (MKL) family
   members, which function not only as actin-binding proteins but also as
   serum response factor (SRF) transcriptional coactivators, regulate
   neuronal morphology. However, the extracellular ligands and signaling
   pathways, which activate MKL-mediated morphological changes in neurons,
   remain unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to MKL1, MKL2,
   highly enriched in the forebrain, strongly contributes to the dendritic
   complexity, and this process is triggered by stimulation with activin, a
   member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily.
   Activin promoted dendritic complexity in a SRF- and MKL-dependent manner
   without drastically affecting MKL localization and protein levels. In
   contrast, activin promoted the nuclear export of suppressor of cancer
   cell invasion (SCAI), which is a corepressor for SRF and MKL.
   Furthermore, overexpression of SCAI blocked activin-induced SRF
   transcriptional responses and dendritic complexity. Collectively, these
   results strongly suggest that activin-SCAI-MKL signaling is a novel
   pathway that regulates the dendritic morphology of rat cortical neurons
   by excluding SCAI from the nucleus and activating MKL/SRF-mediated gene
   expression.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a spontaneous method of controlling the growth mode
   from vertically arrayed ultra-slim MgZnO nanowires to nanowalls through
   the in-plane random motion of the seed crystals formed by surface phase
   separation. Seed crystals with a relatively Zn-rich phase were formed by
   the simultaneous injection of Mg and Zn and became strongly networked
   when the Zn/Mg flux ratio was increased at high temperatures, leading to
   the formation of MgZnO nanowalls on various conducting substrates. The
   hydrogen sensing performance of the MgZnO nanowalls with a
   two-dimensional network structure was superior to that of the
   one-dimensional MgZnO nanowires. Based on the microstructural
   characterizations, the growth procedure for the structural transition
   from MgZnO nanowires to nanowalls on the Si substrates was proposed.}},

Abstract = {{A simple and fast sample preparation method for the determination of
   nonylphenol (NP) and octylphenol (OP) in aqueous samples by simultaneous
   derivatization and dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) was
   investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) In this
   method, a combined dispersant/derivatization catalyst (methanol/pyridine
   mixture) was firstly added to an aqueous sample, following which a
   derivatization reagent/extraction solvent (methyl
   chloroformate/chloroform) was rapidly injected to combine in situ
   derivatization and extraction in a single step After centrifuging, the
   sedimented phase containing the analytes was injected into the GC port
   by autosampler for analysis. Several parameters, such as extraction
   solvent, dispersant solvent, amount of derivatization reagent,
   derivatization and extraction time, pH, and ionic strength were
   optimized to obtain higher sensitivity for the detection of NP and OP.
   Under the optimized conditions', good linearity was observed in the
   range of 0 1-1000 mu g L-1 and 0 01-100 mu g L-1 with the limits of
   detection (LOD)of 0.03 mu g L-1 and 0 002 mu g L-1 for NP and OP,
   respectively. Water samples collected from the Pearl River were analyzed
   with the proposed method, the concentrations of NP and OP were found to
   be 2.40 +/- 0 16 mu g L-1 and 0.037 +/- 0 001 mu g L-1, respectively.
   The relative recoveries of the water samples spiked with different
   concentrations of NP and OP were in the range of 88 3-106.7\%. Compared
   with SPME and SPE, the proposed method can be successfully applied to
   the rapid and convenient determination of NP and OP in aqueous samples

   accomplished by interfacial diffusion of oxygen through the ordered
   liquid aluminum atoms. Oscillatory growth and dissolution reactions at
   the top rim of the nanowires occur and supply the oxygen required to
   grow a new (0006) sapphire layer. A periodic modulation of the VLS
   triple-junction configuration accompanies these oscillatory reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 AdcR (adhesin competence repressor) is the
   first metal-sensing member of the MarR (multiple antibiotic resistance
   repressor) family to be characterized. Expression profiling with a Delta
   adcR strain grown in liquid culture (brain heart infusion) under
   microaerobic conditions revealed upregulation of 13 genes, including
   adcR and adcCBA, encoding a high-affinity ABC uptake system for zinc,
   and genes encoding cell-surface zinc-binding pneumococcal histidine
   triad (Pht) proteins and AdcAII (Lmb, laminin binding). The Delta adcR,
   H108Q and H112Q adcR mutant allelic strains grown in 0.2 mM Zn(II)
   exhibit a slow-growth phenotype and an approximately twofold increase in
   cell-associated Zn(II). Apo- and Zn(II)-bound AdcR are homodimers in
   solution and binding to a 28-mer DNA containing an adc operator is
   strongly stimulated by Zn(II) with KDNA-Zn =2.4 x 10(8) M-1 (pH 6.0, 0.2
   M NaCl, 25 degrees C). AdcR binds two Zn (II) per dimer, with stepwise
   Zn(II) affinities K-zn1 and K-zn2 of >= 10(9) M-1 at pH 6.0 and >=
   10(12) M-1 at pH 8.0, and one to three lower affinity Zn(II) depending
   on the pH. X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the high-affinity site
   reveals a pentacoordinate N/O complex and no cysteine coordination, the
   latter finding corroborated by wild type-like functional properties of
   C30A AdcR. Alanine substitution of conserved residues His42 in the
   DNA-binding domain, and His108 and His112 in the C-terminal regulatory
   domain, abolish high-affinity Zn(l) binding and greatly reduce
   Zn(II)-activated binding to DNA. NMR studies reveal that these mutants
   adopt the same folded conformation as dimeric wild type apo-AdcR, but
   fail to conformationally switch upon Zn(II) binding. These studies
   implicate His42, His108 and H112 as metalloregulatory zinc ligands in S.

Journal = {{RADIO SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{45}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we present a numerical and step by step ray-tracing method
   on a phenomenological ionospheric electron density (N-e) model, the
   TaiWan Ionospheric Model (TWIM), which is constructed from the
   FormoSat3/Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and
   Climate (FS3/COSMIC) ionospheric radio occultation data. With the
   Earth's magnetic field and horizontal N-e gradient effects included,
   efficient methods for calculating ray parameters such as the ground
   range, reflection height, phase path, and group path are presented. The
   three-dimensional TWIM consists of vertically fitted alpha-Chapman-type
   layers, with distinct F2, F1, E, and D layers, for which the layer
   parameters such as peak density, peak density height, and scale height
   are represented by surface spherical harmonics. This way the continuity
   of N-e and its derivatives is maintained. This is important for
   practical schemes for providing reliable radio propagation predictions.
   The methodology is successfully applied to a practical high-frequency
   transmitter for oblique incidence ray tracing and further evaluated by
   comparing synthetic vertical ionograms generated by the method with
   experimental ionosonde observations.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoporous palladium composites with second phase embeddings can be
   fabricated through chemical dealloying of a rapidly solidified Al70Pd30
   alloy in alkaline or acidic solutions under free corrosion conditions.
   The microstructure of the precursor alloy and as-dealloyed nanoporous
   composites was characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
   microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The experimental
   results show that the precursor alloy is composed of Al3Pd and Al3Pd2
   intermetallic compounds, and the resultant composites comprise the
   nanoporous palladium matrix dealloyed from Al3Pd and the undealloyed
   Al3Pd2 embeddings. Moreover, the length scale of ligaments/channels in
   the nanoporous matrix can be adjusted from 3-6 nm to 15-25 nm by simply
   changing the dealloying solution. The electrochemical experiments
   demonstrate that these nanoporous Pd composites have high
   electrochemical active surface areas and exhibit remarkable
   electrocatalytic activities towards methanol and ethanol oxidation in
   alkaline media. These novel nanoporous Pd composites will find potential
   applications in fields of direct alcohol fuel cells, catalysis, sensing,
   actuation, and especially load-related areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate that open solar flux (F-s, derivable from geomagnetic
   data) exhibits stronger correlations with atmospheric circulation
   variations than conventionally-used measures of solar activity. The
   circulation anomalies are particularly enhanced over the North
   Atlantic/Eurasian sector, where there are large changes in the
   occurrence of blocking and the winter mean surface temperature differs
   by several degrees between high-and low-solar terciles. The relationship
   is stronger and simpler for F-s, being more linear between high- and
   low-solar winters. While the circulation anomalies strongly resemble the
   North Atlantic Oscillation they also extend deeper into Eurasia,
   especially in high-solar conditions. This distinct signature may be
   useful for the detection and attribution of observed changes and also
   the identification of dynamical mechanisms. Citation: Woollings, T., M.

Title = {{Construction of an integrated genetic linkage map for the A genome of
   Brassica napus using SSR markers derived from sequenced BACs in B. rapa}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Multinational Brassica rapa Genome Sequencing Project
   (BrGSP) has developed valuable genomic resources, including BAC
   libraries, BAC-end sequences, genetic and physical maps, and seed BAC
   sequences for Brassica rapa. An integrated linkage map between the
   amphidiploid B. napus and diploid B. rapa will facilitate the rapid
   transfer of these valuable resources from B. rapa to B. napus (Oilseed
   rape, Canola).
   Results: In this study, we identified over 23,000 simple sequence
   repeats (SSRs) from 536 sequenced BACs. 890 SSR markers (designated as
   BrGMS) were developed and used for the construction of an integrated
   linkage map for the A genome in B. rapa and B. napus. Two hundred and
   nineteen BrGMS markers were integrated to an existing B. napus linkage
   map (BnaNZDH). Among these mapped BrGMS markers, 168 were only
   distributed on the A genome linkage groups (LGs), 18 distrubuted both on
   the A and C genome LGs, and 33 only distributed on the C genome LGs.
   Most of the A genome LGs in B. napus were collinear with the
   homoeologous LGs in B. rapa, although minor inversions or rearrangements
   occurred on A2 and A9. The mapping of these BAC-specific SSR markers
   enabled assignment of 161 sequenced B. rapa BACs, as well as the
   associated BAC contigs to the A genome LGs of B. napus.
   Conclusion: The genetic mapping of SSR markers derived from sequenced
   BACs in B. rapa enabled direct links to be established between the B.
   napus linkage map and a B. rapa physical map, and thus the assignment of
   B. rapa BACs and the associated BAC contigs to the B. napus linkage map.
   This integrated genetic linkage map will facilitate exploitation of the
   B. rapa annotated genomic resources for gene tagging and map-based
   cloning in B. napus, and for comparative analysis of the A genome within
   Brassica species.}},

Abstract = {{In previous studies on Alzheimer's patients it was shown that, in
   frontal and parietal locations, delta and theta responses of AD patients
   were greatly reduced. The present study analyzed coherence functions in
   these highly affected frontal and parietal areas. Visual sensory and
   event related coherences of patients with Alzheimer type dementia (AD)
   were analyzed comparatively. A total of 38 mild, probable AD subjects
   (19 untreated, 19 treated with cholinesterase inhibitors) were compared
   with a group of 19 healthy controls. The sensory evoked coherence and
   event related target coherences were analyzed for delta (1-3.5 Hz),
   theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (15-30 Hz) and gamma (28-48 Hz)
   frequency ranges for long-range intra-hemispheric (F-3-P-3, F-4-P-4,
   F-3-T-5, F-4-T-6, F-3-O-1, F-4-O-2) electrode pairs. The healthy control
   group showed significantly higher values of event related coherence in
   ``delta{''}, ``theta{''} and ``alpha{''} bands in comparison to the de
   nova and medicated AD groups (p<0.01 for the delta, theta and alpha)
   upon application of a target stimuli. In contrast, almost no changes in
   event related coherences were observed in beta and gamma frequency
   bands. Furthermore, no differences were recorded between healthy and AD
   groups upon application of simple light stimuli. Besides this, coherence
   values upon application of target stimuli were higher than sensory
   evoked coherence in all groups and in all frequency bands (p<0.01). The
   cognitive networks of AD patients were highly impaired in comparison to
   networks activated by sensory stimulation, thus showing separate
   activation of sensory and cognitive networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{First-principles molecular dynamics simulations are used to explore
   sliding along interfaces composed of different forms of hydroxylated
   (0001)/(0001) interfaces of alpha.-alumina (Al2O3). The results
   demonstrate that a fully hydroxylated form of the interface is
   insensitive to changes in normal pressure, P. Meanwhile, partially
   hydroxylated interfaces undergo changes in structure when P is
   increased. The different interface structures exhibit different sliding
   mechanisms. The fully hvdroxylated interlace exhibits smooth sliding
   with low critical shear stresses. At low P, the partially hydroxylated
   interlace takes part in a slip mechanism that is dominated by changes in
   hydrogen bonding across the interface, leading to larger critical shear
   stresses than observed for the fully hydroxylated system. At high P. the
   partially hydroxylated interface undergoes slip through a process
   involving the roromiion and dissociation of Al-O bonds across the
   interface, leading to high critical shear stresses and irreversibly
   changing the interface structure. The differences in the slip mechanisms
   for these systems are rationalized in terms of die electronic structures
   of the interlaces. As a whole, the study provides detailed insight
   regarding the relationship between interlace structure, friction, and
   wear. and highlights the importance of fully chemically passivating
   surfaces to minimizo friction and wear.}},

Abstract = {{Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying quantitative
   neurocognitive phenotypes will further our understanding of the brain's
   structural and functional architecture and advance the diagnosis and
   treatment of the psychiatric disorders that these traits underlie.
   Although many neurocognitive traits are highly heritable, little
   progress has been made in identifying genetic variants unequivocally
   associated with these phenotypes. A major obstacle to such progress is
   the difficulty in identifying heritable neurocognitive measures that are
   precisely defined and systematically assessed and represent unambiguous
   mental constructs, yet are also amenable to the high-throughput
   phenotyping necessary to obtain adequate power for genetic association
   studies. In this perspective we compare the current status of genetic
   investigations of neurocognitive phenotypes to that of other categories
   of biomedically relevant traits and suggest strategies for genetically
   dissecting traits that may underlie disorders of brain and behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations and vibrational SUM frequency generation
   (VSFG) experiments in the methyl-stretching spectral region have been
   used to study acetonitrile at the silica/liquid, silica/vapor, and
   liquid/ vapor interfaces. Our simulations show that, at the
   silica/liquid interlace. acetonitrile takes on a considerably different
   structure than in the bulk liquid. The interfacial structure is
   reminiscent of a lipid bilayer. and this type of ordering persists for
   tens of Angstroms into the bulk liquid. This result has important
   implications for processes involving solid/acetonitrile interfaces, such
   as heterogeneous catalysis and chromatographic separations. Fitting of
   VSFG data that have an extremely low nonresommt background contribution
   provides strong evidence for interfacial populations pointing in
   opposite directions at these interfaces, in agreement with our
   simulations. The picture developed from our simulations and experiments
   reconciles conflicting interpretations of data front previous
   experimental studies of interfacial acelonitrile.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary branching points are a paradigmatic feature of adaptive
   dynamics, because they are potential starting points for adaptive
   diversification. The antithesis to evolutionary branching points are
   continuously stable strategies (CSS's), which are convergent stable and
   evolutionarily stable equilibrium points of the adaptive dynamics and
   hence are thought to represent endpoints of adaptive processes. However,
   this assessment is based on situations in which the invasion fitness
   function determining the adaptive dynamics have non-zero second
   derivatives at CSS. Here we show that the scope of evolutionary
   branching can increase if the invasion fitness function vanishes to
   higher than first order at CSS. Using classical models for
   frequency-dependent competition, we show that if the invasion fitness
   vanishes to higher orders, a CSS may be the starting point for
   evolutionary branching. Thus, when invasion fitness functions vanish to
   higher than first order at equilibrium points of the adaptive dynamics,
   evolutionary diversification can occur even after convergence to an
   evolutionarily stable strategy. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Atmospheric circulation variability associated with the Northern Annular
   Mode (NAM) modulates the climate over large areas in the Northern
   Hemisphere. Therefore, it is expected that future NAM changes in
   response to greenhouse gas concentration increases and other forcing
   will influence the climate change in these regions. Climate models
   simulate a wide range of future NAM changes, which introduces an
   uncertainty into regional climate predictions. To quantify this
   uncertainty we use the intermodel spread of the climate projections by
   the models participated in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   Fourth Assessment Report. We show that the intermodel spread of the
   future NAM projections account for up to 40\% of the variance of the
   surface temperature and precipitation projections over some regions in
   Eurasia and North America across the simulations. This result implies
   that the uncertainty in the future NAM makes a considerable contribution
   into the overall uncertainty in regional climate predictions. Citation:

   electric field gradient axis systems. The inertial information contained
   in the rotational constants combined with the results of the hyperfine
   analysis provides the structure for CF2CHF-HCI. A primary, hydrogen
   bonding interaction exists between the HCI donor and the F atom geminal
   to the H atom on the substituted ethylene. The hydrogen bond is bent
   from linearity to allow a secondary interaction to form between this 11
   atom and the Cl atom. Comparisons made to similar complexes involving
   both other protic acids (HF and HCCH) and fluoroethylenes (vinyl
   fluoride and 1,1-difluoroethylene) reveal the effects of varying gas

Abstract = {{Ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1) and ginsenoside Rg1 (GRg1), two major ingredients
   in ginseng root, have gained extensive attention because of its
   neuroprotective properties. Thus far, most of the studies on GRb1 and
   GRg1 have been focused on their neuroprotective effects on neurons. The
   potential beneficial effects of GRb1 and GRg1 on Schwann cells have not
   been investigated comprehensively. The present study was designed to
   examine the possible beneficial effect of GRb1 and GRg1 on proliferation
   and expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived
   neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in Schwann cells. Schwann cells were
   incubated without or with GRb1 and GRg1 at different doses. The
   proliferation of Schwann cells was examined by cell counting. The
   expression and secretion of NGF and BDNF were examined by western
   blotting and ELISA. We found that both GRb1 and GRg1 were capable of
   increasing the proliferation of, and the expression and secretion of NGF
   and BDNF in Schwann cells. Further studies showed that both GRb1 and
   GRg1 were able to increase intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) level and
   protein ldnase A (PKA) activity. Preincubation with 10 mu M H89 (a PICA
   inhibitor) significantly inhibited the beneficial effects of GRb1 and
   GRg1 on Schwann cells. These findings indicate that the beneficial
   effects of GRb1 and GRg1 on proliferation and expression of NGF and BDNF
   occurs mainly through the PKA pathway in cultured Schwann cells. Crown

   Topological Insulator HgTe/CdTe}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{We present atomistic band structure calculations revealing a different
   mechanism than recently surmised via k . p calculations about the
   evolution of the topological state (TS) in HgTe/CdTe. We show that 2D
   interface (not 1D edge) TSs are possible. We find that the transitions
   from a topological insulator at critical HgTe thickness of n = 23 ML
   (62.5 angstrom) to a normal insulator at smaller n is due to the
   crossing between two interface-localized states: one derived from the
   S-like Gamma(6c) and one derived from the P-like Gamma(8v) light hole,
   not because of the crossing of an interface state and an extended
   quantum well state. These atomistic calculations suggest that a 2D TS
   can exist in a 2D system, even without truncating its symmetry to 1D,
   thus explaining the otherwise surprising similarity between the 2D
   dispersion curves of the TS in HgTe/CdTe with those of the TS in 3D bulk
   materials such as Bi(2)Se(3).}},

Abstract = {{Recent reports question the validity of pulsed fs-laser experiments for
   measuring the photon-to-exciton quantum yields (QYs) that result from
   multiple exciton generation (MEG). The repetitive nature of these
   experiments opens up an alternative relaxation pathway that may produce
   artificially high results. We present transient-absorption (TA) data for
   4.6 and 6.6 nm diameter PbSe quantum dots (QDs) at a variety of pump
   photon energies. The data are collected under laminar How conditions
   with volumetric flow rates ranging from 0 to 150 mL/min (resulting in
   Reynolds numbers up to 460). The results are modeled with a spatially
   resolved population balance of generation, recombination, convective
   replacement, ind accumulation of long-lived excited QDs. By comparing
   the simulations and experiments, the steady-state population of the
   long-lived QD-excited states and their kinetics are determined for
   different experimental conditions. We also improve upon reported
   photon-to-exciton QYs for PbSe QDs. We find differences in the observed
   TA dynamics between flowing and static conditions that depend upon
   photon fluence, pump photon energy, and quality of the QD surfaces. For
   excitation energies below 2 Et-g. independent of QD size or photon
   fluence, we observe no flow rate dependence in the TA dynamics. At
   excitation energies of hv > 3 E-g, we observe differences between static
   and flowing conditions that are most pronounced for high photon
   fluences. At 3.7 E-g and for 4.6 HMI PbSe QDs we find a QY of 1.2 +/-
   0.1 and at 4.5 E-g the QY is 1.55 +/- 0.05. With 6.6 nm QDs excited it
   4.7 E-g we observe no difference between static and flowing conditions
   and find a QY of 1.61 +/- 0.05. We also find that by treating the
   surface of QDs. we can decrease the charging probability (P-g
   approximate to 5 x 10(-5)) be a factor of 3-4. The observed variations
   suggest that different QD samples vary regarding their susceptibility to
   lie creation of long-lived states.}},

Abstract = {{It is a fact that the minimal conductivity sigma(0) of most graphene
   samples is larger than the well-established universal value for ideal
   graphene 4e(2)/pi h; in particular, larger by a factor greater than or
   similar to pi. Despite intense theoretical activity, this fundamental
   issue has eluded an explanation so far. Here we present fully atomistic
   quantum mechanical estimates of the graphene minimal conductivity where
   electron-electron interactions are considered in the framework of
   density-functional theory. We show the conclusive evidence of the
   dominant role on the minimal conductivity of charged impurities over
   ripples, which have no visible effect. Furthermore, in combination with
   the logarithmic scaling law for diffusive metallic graphene, we
   elucidate the origin of the ubiquitously observed minimal conductivity
   in the range 8e(2)/h > sigma(0) greater than or similar to 4e(2)/h.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a technique for assessing the diurnal development of

   Using the size distribution of the storms measured from a series of
   images, we generate an array in the length scale-time domain based on
   the standard score statistic. It demonstrates succinctly the size
   evolution of storms as well as the dissipation kinematics. It also
   provides evidence related to the temperature evolution of the cloud
   tops. We apply this approach to a test case comparing observations made
   by the Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget instrument to output from
   the Met Office Unified Model run at two resolutions. The 12 km
   resolution model produces peak convective activity on all length scales
   significantly earlier in the day than shown by the observations and no
   evidence for storms growing in size. The 4 km resolution model shows

Abstract = {{Automatic tube current modulation (TCM) is used in modern CT devices.
   This is implemented in the numerical calculation of dose conversion
   coefficients for CT examinations. For four models of adults, the female
   and male reference models of ICRP and ICRU and a lighter and a heavier
   female model, dose conversion coefficients normalized to CTDIvol (DCCCT)
   have been computed with a Monte Carlo transport code for CT scans with
   and without TCM. It could be shown for both cases that reliable values
   for spiral CT scans are obtained when combining the results from an
   appropriate set of axial scans. The largest organ DCCCT are presented
   for typical CT examinations for all four models. The impact of TCM is
   greatest for chest, pelvis and whole-trunk CT examinations, where with
   TCM the effective DCCCT can be 20-25\% lower than without TCM. Typical
   organs with strong dependence on TCM are thyroid, urinary bladder, lungs
   and oesophagus. While the DCCCT of thyroid and urinary bladder are
   mainly sensitive to angular TCM, the DCCCT of lungs and oesophagus are
   influenced primarily by longitudinal TCM. The impact of the body stature
   on the effective DCCCT is of the same order as the effect of TCM. Thus,
   for CT scans in the trunk region, accurate dose values can only be
   obtained when different sets of DCCCT are employed that are appropriate
   for the patient's sex and stature and the actual TCM settings.}},

   with Ar/O-2 concentration ratios up to 50\% has been studied in a Pyrex

   to 40 mA.
   The electric field strength and emission spectra parameters of the
   discharge were studied by means of the double-probe method and optical
   emission spectroscopy. The electric field strength was found to increase
   with the pressure and decrease with the discharge current, which is
   typical for DC glow discharges. Considering O-2-Ar mixtures, the values
   of electric field strength decreased with Ar/O-2 ratio.
   We have focused on the emitted radiation. The rotational temperature
   T-rot of molecular oxygen was determined from the well-resolved
   atmospheric A-band at 760 nm. The increase of the rotational temperature
   with increasing deposited power has been observed for all studied Ar/O-2
   ratios. Moreover, it has been found that values of T-rot are independent

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations can aid studies of the structural and

   dynamics,-energetics, and interactions with their local environment at
   the atomistic level. We argue that nonstandard protocols are needed to
   realistically model collagen proteins, which in their biological state
   aggregate to form collagen fibrils, and so should not be treated as
   fully solvated molecules. A new modeling approach is presented that can
   account for the local environment of collagen molecules within a fibril
   and which therefore simulates aspects of their behavior that would not
   otherwise be distinguished. This modeling approach exploits periodic
   boundaries to replicate the supermolecular arrangement of collagen
   proteins within the fibril, in an approach. that is more commonly
   associated with modeling crystalline solids rather than mesoscopic
   protein aggregates. Initial simulations show agreement with experimental
   observations and corroborate. theories of the fibril's structure.}},

Abstract = {{The excellent metal support interaction between palladium (Pd) and
   titanium nitride (TiN) is exploited in designing an efficient anode
   material. Pd-TN, that could be useful for direct ethanol fuel cell in
   alkaline media. The physicochemical and electrochemical characterization
   of the Pd-TiN/electrolyte interface reveals an efficient oxidation of
   ethanol coupled with excellent stability of the catalyst under
   electrochemical conditions. Characterization of the interface using in
   situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (in situ FITR) shows the
   production CO2 at low overvoltages revealing an efficient cleaving of
   the C-C bond. The performance comparison of Pd supported on TiN (Pd-TiN)
   with that supported on carbon (Pd-C) clearly demonstrates the advantages
   of TiN support over carbon. A positive chemical shift of Pd (3d) binding
   energy confirms the existence of metal support interaction between pd
   and TiN, which in turn helps weaken the Pd-CO synergetic bonding
   interaction. The remarkable ability of TiN to accumulate -OH species on
   its surface coupled with the strong adhesion of Pd makes TiN an active
   support material for electrocatalysts.}},

Abstract = {{The colloidal glass transition, ionic transport, and optical properties
   of soft glassy colloidal arrays (SGCAs) that consist of poly(methyl
   methacrylate) (PMMA)-grafted silica nanoparticles (PMMA-g-NPs) and a
   room-temperature ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)amide ({[}C(2)mim]{[}NTf2]), were
   investigated. At lower particle concentrations, PMMA-g-NPs were
   well-suspended in the IL without any aggregation or sedimentation, and
   the dilute suspensions showed liquid-like behavior. However, above a
   certain-particle concentration, the suspensions became solidified and
   exhibited different structural colors depending on the particle
   concentrations. The liquid-solid transition of the SGCAs was essentially
   caused by Colloidal glass transition. Due to the soft repulsive
   interaction between the particles, the effective volume fraction of the
   particle (phi(eff)) required for colloidal glass transition was higher
   than that of the hard sphere system and found to be approximately
   0.70-0.74. The SGCA had sufficient ionic conductivity, which was greater
   than 10(-3) S cm(-1) at room temperature, even in the highly
   concentrated region. For ionic transport of the cation and the anion in
   the SGCAs, the decrease in diffusivity observed with the addition of the
   particles (D-g/D-0) was slightly greater for the {[}NTf2] anion than
   that of the {[}C(2)mim] cation, suggesting that the {[}NTf2] anion
   preferentially interacts with the PMMA chains. The SGCAs showed
   homogeneous, nonbrilliant, and angle-independent structural colors above
   the glass transition volume fraction. In addition, the color of the
   SGCAs changed from red to green to blue as the particle concentration
   increased. A linear relationship was found between the maximum
   wavelength of the reflection spectra and the center-to-center distance
   in the SGCAs.}},

Title = {{MicroRNAs: exploring a new dimension in the pathogenesis of kidney
   cancer}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common neoplasm of the adult
   kidney. The role of the von-Hippel-Lindeau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene
   is well established in RCC with a loss of VHL protein leading to
   accumulated hypoxia-induced factor (HIF) and the subsequent
   transcriptional activation of multiple downstream targets. Recently,
   microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be differentially expressed in RCC
   and their role in RCC pathogenesis is emerging. This month, in BMC
   Medicine, Gleadle and colleagues show that certain miRNAs are regulated
   by VHL in either a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-dependent or
   HIF-independent manner in RCC. They also show that miRNA expression
   correlates with the survival of RCC patients.
   In this commentary, we discuss the current understanding of the role of
   miRNAs in RCC and the different possible scenarios of their involvement
   in RCC pathogenesis. We also address their clinical significance as
   tumour markers, together with the potential use of miRNAs as therapeutic
   targets. Finally, we discuss some of the challenges that face the
   fast-evolving field of miRNAs, including the identification and
   validation of miRNA targets and the difficulties associated with
   establishing a link between miRNA expression and biological effects. A
   more thorough understanding of the biological nature of miRNAs and
   careful experimental planning will help us to reveal the complex role
   that miRNAs play in RCC pathogenesis.

Abstract = {{We use a continuum chain model and develop an analytical theory for the
   interaction between two spheres immersed in a fluid of ideal equilibrium
   polymers. The theory can be applied to both adsorbing and nonadsorbing
   spheres. Here we focus on two nonadsorbing spheres and determine the
   classical depletion interaction between them. Compact, and exact,
   results are derived for the asymptotic behavior of the depletion
   interaction, which has a Yukawa form. We show also that in the limit of
   large spheres (and large surface to surface separation) the Derjaguin
   approximation is valid. We compare our asymptotic expression with
   numerical solutions of an ideal equilibrium polymer fluid consisting of
   discrete chains. Our asymptotic approximation accurately predicts
   long-range interactions between small spheres. For large spheres it
   predicts the interaction very well over most of the separation range. We
   also consider a single sphere immersed in the polymer fluid and show how
   our results can be generalized to treat polydisperse polymer fluids,
   where the polydispersity is described by a Schulz-Flory distribution.

Abstract = {{Novel p-type materials, liquid-crystalline polyfluorene and its
   copolymer containing a terphenyl mesogen pendant, namely,
   poly\{9,9-bis{[}6-(4'-hexyloxy-terphenyloxy)-hexyl]-fluorene\} (PFBHeT)
   and
   poly\{9,9-bis{[}6-(4'-hexyloxy-terphenyloxy)-hexyl]-fluorene-co-3-hexyl-
   thiophene\} (PFBHeT-3HT), were designed and synthesized, respectively.
   The effects of the structural variation on their properties, especially
   the influences of the thermal treatment on the blend morphology of
   polymers and {[}6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (POW), have
   been characterized and investigated. The spontaneous Orientation of
   terphenyl mesogen endows the polymer and blend films with a good ordered
   morphology. The annealed and quenched films exhibit better
   liquid-crystalline properties, a lower LUMO, and better ordered domains
   compared with the untreated one. and the annealed films are favorable.
   It indicates that the spontaneous assembly of the liquid-crystalline
   molecules pushes PCBM clusters to form an oriented nanodispersing
   structure with highly oriented channel layers upon heating at
   liquid-crystalline states, and the annealing process offers enough
   stress relaxation time or the molecules to pack into a well-ordered
   stacking. Furthermore, the bulk heterojunction devices based on the
   PFBHeT-3HT:PCBM (1:2) active layer have been constructed. Without
   extensive optimization, annealing the devices yields a V-oe of 0.63 V
   and a power conversion efficiency of 0.25\%. showing a significantly
   increased J(sc) and FF with respect to is untreated counterpart.}},

Abstract = {{We suggested a Monte Carlo approach to simulate a kinetic equilibrium
   ensemble, and proved the equivalence to the linear equations method on

   variable splitting rates representing the details of the dynamics as
   model parameters which were not considered in previous works. The
   dependence on model parameters was studied, and it was found that the
   sea quark flavor asymmetry weakly depends on model parameters. It
   reflects the statistics principle, contributes the dominant part of the
   asymmetry, and the effect caused by details of the dynamics is small. We
   also applied the Monte Carlo approach of the statistical model to
   predict the theoretical sea quark asymmetries in kaons, octet baryons
   Sigma, Xi, and Delta baryons, even in exotic pentaquark states.}},

Abstract = {{Three novel mixed (phthalocyaninato)(porphyrinato) yttrium double-decker
   complexes appended with one metal-free porphyrin chromophore at the
   pant, meta, and ortho position, respectively, of one meso-phenyl group
   of the porphyrin ligand in the double-decker Unit through ester linkage,
   3-5, have been designed, synthesized, and spectroscopically
   characterized. The photophysical properties of these three isomeric
   tetrapyrrole triads were comparatively investigated along with the model
   compounds metal-free tetrakis(4-butyl)porphyrin H-2-TBPP (1) and mixed
   {[}1,4,8,11,15,18,22,25-octakis(butyloxyl)phthalocyaninato]{[}tetrakis(4
   -butyl)porphyrinato] yttrium double-decker complex
   HY{[}Pc(alpha-OC4H9)(8)](TBPP) (2) by steady-state and transient
   spectroscopic methods. The fluorescence of the metal-free porphyrin
   moiety attached through ester linkage at the meta and ortho position of
   one meso-phenyl group of porphyrin ligand in the double-decker unit in
   triads 4 and 5 is effectively quenched by the double-decker unit, which
   takes place in several hundred femtoseconds. However, the fluorescence
   of the metal-free porphyrin moiety attached at the par position of one
   meso-phenyl group of porphyrin ligand in the double-decker unit in triad
   3 is only partially quenched, clearly revealing the effect of the
   position of porphyrin-substituent on the photophysical properties of the
   triads. Furthermore, the molecular structures of 3-5 were simulated
   using density functional theory calculations. It was found that the
   relative orientation between the metal-free porphyrin moiety and the
   double-decker unit for compound 3 is crossed, while those for compounds
   4 and 5 are open- and closed-shellfish-like, respectively, which is
   suggested to be responsible for their different intramolecular
   fluorescent quenching efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The etiology of major depression remains unknown, but dysfunction of
   serotonergic signaling has long been implicated in the pathophysiology
   of this disorder. p11 is an S100 family member recently identified as a
   serotonin 1B {[}5-hydroxytryptamine 1B (5-HT1B)] and serotonin 4 (5-HT4)
   receptor-binding protein. Mutant mice in which p11 is deleted show
   depression-like behaviors, suggesting that p11 may be a mediator of
   affective disorder pathophysiology. Using somatic gene transfer, we have
   now identified the nucleus accumbens as a key site of p11 action.
   Reduction of p11 with adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated RNA
   interference in the nucleus accumbens, but not in the anterior
   cingulate, of normal adult mice resulted in depression-like behaviors
   nearly identical to those seen in p11 knockout mice. Restoration of p11
   expression specifically in the nucleus accumbens of p11 knockout mice
   normalized depression-like behaviors. Human nucleus accumbens tissue
   shows a significant reduction of p11 protein in depressed patients when
   compared to matched healthy controls. These results suggest that p11
   loss in rodent and human nucleus accumbens may contribute to the
   pathophysiology of depression. Normalization of p11 expression within
   this brain region with AAV-mediated gene therapy may be of therapeutic
   value.}},

   long-term deactivation of Pt catalysts, associated with life or
   deactivation tests, in the kinetic model. This has been successfully
   achieved by assuming that the long-term deactivation is the sum of two
   exponential decay processes, one rapid and completed in a few days,

   The construction of the methods is particularly focused on two points:
   on one hand, the generation of the ground state profiles, to be used in
   the initial data of the simulations, combines a suitable spatial
   discretization with the resolution of a discrete variational problem. On
   the other hand, the approximation to leading parameters of these
   structures is controlled by the time integration. We compare different
   methods when simulating the evolution of initial ground state profiles

Abstract = {{The dynamics of dewetting is re-examined from a theoretical perspective
   and in the light of experiment. Two cases are considered: (a)
   spontaneous dewetting following rupture of a thin liquid film previously
   formed on a partially wetted solid surface; (b) steady dewetting when a
   partially wetted solid surface is withdrawn vertically from a pool of
   liquid. In the first, a rim of liquid forms at a circular dewetting
   front that expands at constant speed, while the remainder of the film
   remains quiescent. The second is characterised by the formation of a
   serrated contact line, in which each straight-line section also recedes
   at a constant normal velocity, but with no significant rim. These two
   cases are analysed in terms of the relevant dissipation processes.
   Hydrodynamic dissipation is estimated using a simple model proposed by
   de Gennes, while the molecular-kinetic theory accounts for contact-line
   friction. The new analysis suggests that for a given system, the
   dewetting velocities and dynamic contact angles seen in the two cases
   are likely to be different. In (a), they will be the outcome of both
   dissipation channels operating in parallel, whereas in (b), both
   parameters will be determined by a dynamic balance between the two
   sources of dissipation that avoids an inflection in the liquid-vapour
   interface near the receding contact line. These predictions are
   consistent with current observations and could be tested by
   well-designed experiments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Background: The eye lens presents a unique opportunity to explore roles
   for specific molecules in cell proliferation, differentiation and
   development because cells remain in place throughout life and, like red
   blood cells and keratinocytes, they go through the most extreme
   differentiation, including removal of nuclei and cessation of protein
   synthesis. Ubiquitination controls many critical cellular processes,
   most of which require specific lysines on ubiquitin (Ub). Of the 7
   lysines (K) least is known about effects of modification of K6.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: We replaced K6 with tryptophan (W)
   because K6 is the most readily modified K and W is the most structurally
   similar residue to biotin. The backbone of K6W-Ub is indistinguishable
   from that of Wt-Ub. K6W-Ub is effectively conjugated and deconjugated
   but the conjugates are not degraded via the ubiquitin proteasome
   pathways (UPP). Expression of K6W-ubiquitin in the lens and lens cells
   results in accumulation of intracellular aggregates and also slows cell
   proliferation and the differentiation program, including expression of
   lens specific proteins, differentiation of epithelial cells into fibers,
   achieving proper fiber cell morphology, and removal of nuclei. The
   latter is critical for transparency, but the mechanism by which cell
   nuclei are removed has remained an age old enigma. This was also solved
   by expressing K6W-Ub. p27(kip), a UPP substrate accumulates in lenses
   which express K6W-Ub. This precludes phosphorylation of nuclear lamin by
   the mitotic kinase, a prerequisite for disassembly of the nuclear
   membrane. Thus the nucleus remains intact and DNAseII beta neither gains
   entry to the nucleus nor degrades the DNA. These results could not be
   obtained using chemical proteasome inhibitors that cannot be directed to
   specific tissues.
   Conclusions and Significance: K6W-Ub provides a novel, genetic means to
   study functions of the UPP because it can be targeted to specific cells
   and tissues. A fully functional UPP is required to execute most stages
   of lens differentiation, specifically removal of cell nuclei. In the
   absence of a functional UPP, small aggregate prone, cataractous lenses
   are formed.}},

   parameters increased to the peak of value at 28th d post LPS-injection.
   Moreover, RT-PCR analysis suggested that LPS significantly up-regulated
   the expression of both IL-8 and hepcidin in several tissues. These data

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship of somatic
   cell count (SCC) with milk yield, fat and protein percentage, fat and
   protein yield using analysis of variance and correlation analysis in
   Chinese Holstein population. The 10524 test-day records of 568 Chinese
   Holstein Cattle were obtained from 2 commercial herds in Xi'an region of
   China during February 2002 to March 2009. Milk yield, fat percentage,
   fat and protein yield initially increased and then dropped down with
   parity, whereas protein percentage decreased and SCC increased. Analysis
   of variance showed highly significant effects of different subclasses
   SCC on milk yield and composition (P<0.01). Compared with milk yield
   with SCC <= 200000 cells mL(-1), milk yield losses with SCC of
   200000-500000 cells mL(-1), 501000-1000000 cells mL(-1), >= 1000000
   cells mL(-1) were 0.387, 0.961 and 2.351 kg, respectively. The highly
   significant negative correlation coefficient between somatic cell score
   (SCS) and milk and protein yield, milk yield and fat and protein
   percentage, protein percentage and fat yield were -0.084, -0.037,
   -0.061, -0.168, and -0.088, respectively (P<0.01). The highly

Abstract = {{Background: Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SNEC) of maxillary
   sinus is a rare and aggressive malignancy. A tumor with squamous cell
   carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and SNEC co-existence is extremely rare.
   Case presentation: We present a colliding tumor of squamous cell,
   adenocarcinoma and SNEC in maxillary sinus. The clinical features,
   diagnosis and EGFR flourescence in situ hybridization (FISH) study are
   presented. A 52-year-old female had a 1-month history of progressing
   left cheek swelling and purulent rhinorrhea. Magnetic resonance imaging
   showed a tumor involving left maxilla and orbital floor. Excision of
   tumor was done and the defect was reconstructed with free flap. The
   pathology revealed a malignant tumor composed of squamous cell
   carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and SNEC components. EGFR FISH study showed no
   gene amplification in 3 components of this tumor. The tumor progressed
   rapidly and the patient expired at 8 months after surgery.
   Conclusion: A colliding tumor of squamous cell, adenocarcinoma and
   neuroendocrine carcinoma in maxillary sinus was aggressive in behavior
   and the treatment response was poor due to the complexity of tumor.}},

   characteristics of OPH-1P and OPH-2P as orange host materials doped with
   iridium(III) bis(2-phenylquinoline)acetylacetonate (Ir(pq)(2)acac) were
   evaluated. The electroluminescence spectra of the ITO (150 nm)/DNTPD (60

   nm)/Alq(3) (20 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (200 nm) devices show a narrow emission
   band with a full width at half maximum of 75 nm and lambda(max) = 596

   an orange color purity of (0.580, 0.385) and an efficiency of (14 cd/A
   at 7.0 V). The ability of the OPH-P series to combine a high triple
   energy with a low operating voltage is attributed to the inductive
   effect of the P=O moieties and subsequent energy lowering of the LUMO,
   resulting in the enhancement of both the electron injection and
   transport in the device. The overall result is a device with an EQE >
   8\% at high brightness, but operating voltage of less than 6.4 V, as

   PHPAM Gel Systems as Water Shutoff Agents in Low Temperature Reservoirs}},

Abstract = {{Using gel as the water shutoff agent has been widely reported in the
   aspect of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) of the development of mature oil
   fields. Cross-linkers such as chromium(III) acetate and phenol
   formaldehyde are commonly used, but they are toxic. Today, use of low
   toxic polyethyleneimine (PEI) cross-linking a copolymer of acrylamide
   and tert-butyl acrylate (PAtBA) as the water shutoff gel is reported
   more but is mainly focused on its theoretical research and applications
   in high temperature reservoirs. Because of the defects of the
   chromium(III) acetate and phenol formaldehyde cross-linkers, the
   gelation performance of PEI/partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PHPAM)
   gel systems at low temperature (40 degrees C) is discussed in this
   paper. The results show that the gelation time and strength of the
   PEI/PHPAM gel system can be perfectly controlled by adjusting the PHPAM
   concentration, the molecular weight, the PEI concentration, and the
   total dissolved solids. The polymer concentration and molecular weight
   can affect not only the gelation time and the gel strength but also its
   stability. Among them the polymer concentration is the most important
   factor that affects the gel stability. For the low temperature
   reservoirs, the most common used chromium(111) acetate/PHPAM gel system
   has only around 5 h of gelation time at 40 degrees C to get a high gel
   strength. However, the PEUPHPAM gel system can achieve a much longer
   gelation time. Polymer gels formulated with a combination of 1.5 wt \%
   PHPAM and added 0.3-0.8 wt \% PEI provide a gelation time between 15 h
   and 9 days, and the maximum gel strength could reach code I. This study
   suggests that the low toxic PEI/PHPAM gel system can be used in low
   temperature reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{Functional hairy poly(styrene-b-glycidylmethacrylate) (P(S-GMA)) brushes
   were generated by grafting from bromoacetylated
   poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) (P(S-DVB)) microspheres via
   surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-AIRP). Two
   different approaches for the covalent immobilization of lipase onto
   microspheres were studied for the first time: (I) direct immobilization
   of lipase to the polymer brushes via their epoxy groups, and (2)
   immobilization of lipase via glutaraldehyde coupling after attachment of
   a spacer arm (hexamethylendiamine (HMDA)) to the polymer brushes. The
   covalent immobilization of the lipase on microspheres after spacer-arm
   attachment and glutaraldeyhde coupling was found to be the more
   effective than the direct binding method. In this case, a maximum value
   of the immobilized enzyme activity 498.5 U g(-1) was found with an
   enzyme loading of 27.6 mg per gram of support. Thermal and storage
   stabilities increase upon immobilization on the
   P(S-DVB)-g-P(S-GMA)-HMDA-GA microspheres. Finally, esterification
   reactions have been performed to produce ethyl acetate and isoamyl
   acetate in a solvent-free system and in n-hexane using
   lipase-immobilized P(S-DVB)-g-P(S-GMA)-HMDA-GA microspheres. The
   immobilized lipase was effectively reused in successive batch runs in a
   solvent-free system for isoamyl acetate synthesis, and only 21\%
   activity was lost after 10 cycles.}},

Title = {{Complete response in gallbladder cancer to erlotinib plus gemcitabine
   does not require mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene:
   a case report}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Gallbladder cancer typically follows an aggressive course,
   with chemotherapy the standard of care for advanced disease; complete
   remissions are rarely encountered. The epidermal growth factor receptor
   (EGFR) is a promising therapeutic target but the activity of single
   agent oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors is low. There have been no
   previous reports of chemotherapy plus an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor
   (TKI) to treat gallbladder cancer or correlations of response with the
   mutation status of the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene.
   Case presentation: A 67 year old man with metastatic gallbladder cancer
   involving the liver and abdominal lymph nodes was treated with
   gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) on day 1 and 8 every 21 days as well as daily
   erlotinib (100 mg). After four cycles of therapy, the CA 19-9 normalized
   and a PET/CT showed a complete remission; this response was maintained
   by the end of 12 cycles of therapy. Gemcitabine was then discontinued
   and single agent erlotinib was continued as maintenance therapy. The
   disease remains in good control 18 months after initiation of therapy,
   including 6 months on maintenance erlotinib. The only grade 3 toxicity
   was a typical EGFR-related skin rash. Because of the remarkable response
   to erlotinib plus gemcitabine, we performed tumor genotyping of the EGFR
   gene for response predicting mutations in exons 18, 19 and 21. This
   disclosed the wild-type genotype with no mutations found.
   Conclusion: This case report demonstrates a patient with stage IV
   gallbladder cancer who experienced a rarely encountered complete,
   prolonged response after treatment with an oral EGFR-TKI plus
   chemotherapy. This response occurred in the absence of an EGFR gene
   mutation. These observations should inform the design of clinical trials
   using EGFR-TKIs to treat gallbladder and other biliary tract cancers;
   such trials should not select patients based on EGFR mutation status.}},

Abstract = {{We present a detailed study of the star formation history (SFH) of the
   Tucana dwarf spheroidal galaxy. High-quality, deep HST/ACS data,
   collected in the framework of the LCID project, allowed us to obtain the
   deepest color-magnitude diagram to date, reaching the old main-sequence
   turnoff (F814 similar to 29) with good photometric accuracy. Our
   analysis, based on three different SFH codes, shows that Tucana is an
   old and metal-poor stellar system, which experienced a strong initial
   burst of star formation at a very early epoch (similar or equal to 13
   Gyr ago) which lasted a maximum of 1 Gyr (sigma value). We are not able
   to unambiguously answer the question of whether most star formation in
   Tucana occurred before or after the end of the reionization era, and we
   analyze alternative scenarios that may explain the transformation of
   Tucana from a gas-rich galaxy into a dSph. Current measurements of its
   radial velocity do not preclude that Tucana may have crossed the inner
   regions of the Local Group (LG) once, and so gas stripping by ram
   pressure and tides due to a close interaction cannot be ruled out. A
   single pericenter passage would generate insufficient tidal heating to
   turn an originally disky dwarf into a true dSph; however, this
   possibility would be consistent with the observed residual rotation in
   Tucana. On the other hand, the high star formation rate measured at
   early times may have injected enough energy into the interstellar medium
   to blow out a significant fraction of the initial gas content. Gas that
   is heated but not blown out would also be more easily stripped via ram
   pressure. We compare the SFH inferred for Tucana with that of Cetus, the
   other isolated LG dSph galaxy in the LCID sample. We show that the
   formation time of the bulk of star formation in Cetus is clearly delayed
   with respect to that of Tucana. This reinforces the conclusion of
   Monelli et al. that Cetus formed the vast majority of its stars after
   the end of the reionization era implying, therefore, that small dwarf
   galaxies are not necessarily strongly affected by reionization, in
   agreement with many state-of-the-art cosmological models.}},

Abstract = {{In chemotaxis of Escherichia coli and other bacteria, extracellular
   stimuli are perceived by transmembrane receptors that bind their ligands
   either directly, or indirectly through periplasmic-binding proteins
   (BPs). As BPs are also involved in ligand uptake, they provide a link
   between chemotaxis and nutrient utilization by cells. However,
   signalling by indirectly binding ligands remains much less understood
   than signalling by directly binding ligands. Here, we compared
   intracellular responses mediated by both types of ligands and developed
   a new mathematical model for signalling by indirectly binding ligands.
   We show that indirect binding allows cells to better control sensitivity
   to specific ligands in response to their nutrient environment and to
   coordinate chemotaxis with ligand transport, but at the cost of the
   dynamic range being much narrower than for directly binding ligands. We
   further demonstrate that signal integration by the chemosensory
   complexes does not depend on the type of ligand. Overall, our data
   suggest that the distinction between signalling by directly and
   indirectly binding ligands is more physiologically important than the
   traditional distinction between high- and low-abundance receptors. The

Abstract = {{Rho family small GTPases are important regulators of neuronal
   development. Defective Rho regulation causes nervous system dysfunctions
   including mental retardation and Alzheimer's disease. Rac1, a member of
   the Rho family, regulates dendritic spines and excitatory synapses, but
   relatively little is known about how synaptic Rac1 is negatively
   regulated. Breakpoint cluster region (BCR) is a Rac GTPase-activating
   protein known to form a fusion protein with the c-Abl tyrosine kinase in
   Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. Despite
   the fact that BCR mRNAs are abundantly expressed in the brain, the
   neural functions of BCR protein have remained obscure. We report here
   that BCR and its close relative active BCR-related (ABR) localize at
   excitatory synapses and directly interact with PSD-95, an abundant
   postsynaptic scaffolding protein. Mice deficient for BCR or ABR show
   enhanced basal Rac1 activity but only a small increase in spine density.
   Importantly, mice lacking BCR or ABR exhibit a marked decrease in the
   maintenance, but not induction, of long-term potentiation, and show
   impaired spatial and object recognition memory. These results suggest
   that BCR and ABR have novel roles in the regulation of synaptic Rac1
   signaling, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory, and that
   excessive Rac1 activity negatively affects synaptic and cognitive
   functions.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we show that the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)
   formalism applied to a Hubbard model is capable to predict the s-, p-
   and d-wave superconductivity within a single theoretical scheme. This
   study is performed on a square lattice described by a generalized
   Hubbard Hamiltonian, in which correlated-hopping interactions are
   included in addition to the repulsive Coulombic one. With in the BCS
   formal is musing a variable chemical potential, the superconducting
   ground states are determined by two coupled integral equations, whose
   integrand functions have main contributions around the Fermi surface. We
   observe the existence of a maximum critical temperature for s-, p- and
   d-wave superconducting channels that occur at the medium, low and high
   electron densities, respectively. Furthermore, the p- and d-wave
   superconducting specific heats show a power-law temperature dependence,
   instead of the exponential one for the s channel. Finally, the smallness
   of the anisotropic single-energy-excitation-gap minima is essential for
   the specific heat behavior, and this fact allows to understand the
   experimental data obtained from Sr(2)RuO(4) and La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO(4)

Abstract = {{Human immunodeficiency virus-associated neurological disease (HAND)
   still causes significant morbidity, despite success reducing viral loads
   with combination antiretroviral therapy. The dopamine (DA) system is
   particularly vulnerable in HAND. We hypothesize that early,
   ``reversible{''} DAergic synaptic dysfunction occurs long before DAergic
   neuron loss. As such, aging human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
   individuals may be vulnerable to other age-related neurodegenerative
   diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD), underscoring the need to
   understand shared molecular targets in HAND and PD. Previously, we
   reported that the neurotoxic HIV-1 transactivating factor (Tat) acutely
   disrupts mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis via
   ryanodine receptor (RyR) activation. Here, we further report that Tat
   disrupts DA transporter (DAT) activity and function, resulting in
   increased plasma membrane (PM) DAT and increased DAT V-max, without
   changes in K-m or total DAT protein. Tat also increases calpain protease
   activity at the PM, demonstrated by total internal reflection
   fluorescence microscopy of a cleavable fluorescent calpain substrate.
   Tat-increased PM DAT and calpain activity are blocked by the RyR
   antagonists ryanodine and dantrolene, the calpain inhibitor calpastatin,
   and by a specific inhibitor of GSK-3 beta. We conclude that Tat
   activates RyRs via a calcium-and calpain-mediated mechanism that
   upregulates DAT trafficking to the PM, and is independent of DAT protein
   synthesis, reinforcing the feasibility of RyR and GSK-3 beta inhibition
   as clinical therapeutic approaches for HAND. Finally, we provide key
   translational relevance for these findings by highlighting published
   human data of increased DAT levels in striata of HAND patients and by
   demonstrating similar findings in Tat-expressing transgenic mice.}},

Title = {{Transcriptome changes in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) cv. Malbec leaves
   induced by ultraviolet-B radiation}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B, 280-315 nm) is a natural
   component of sunlight, which has numerous regulatory effects on plant
   physiology. The nature of the response to UV-B is dependent on fluence
   rate, dose, duration and wavelength of the UV-B treatment. Some reports
   have analyzed the changes in gene expression caused by UV-B light on
   several plant species using microarray technology. However, there is no
   information on the transcriptome response triggered by UV-B in
   grapevine. In this paper we investigate the gene expression responses of
   leaves from in vitro cultured Vitis vinifera cv. Malbec plants subjected
   to the same dose of biologically effective UV-B radiation (4.75 kJ m(-2)
   d(-1)) administered at two different fluence rates (16 h at congruent to
   8.25 mu W cm(-2), 4 h at congruent to 33 mu W cm(-2)) using a new custom
   made GrapeGen Affymetrix GeneChip (R).
   Results: The number of genes modulated by high fluence rate UV-B doubled
   the number of genes modulated by low fluence UV-B. Their functional
   analyses revealed several functional categories commonly regulated by
   both UV-B treatments as well as categories more specifically modulated
   depending on UV-B fluence rate. General protective responses, namely the
   induction of pathways regulating synthesis of UV-B absorbing compounds
   such as the Phenylpropanoid pathway, the induction of different
   antioxidant defense systems and the activation of pathways commonly
   associated with pathogen defense and abiotic stress responses seem to
   play critical roles in grapevine responses against UV-B radiation.
   Furthermore, high fluence rate UV-B seemed to specifically modulate
   additional pathways and processes in order to protect grapevine
   plantlets against UV-B-induced oxidative stress, stop the cell cycle
   progression, and control protein degradation. On the other hand, low
   fluence rate UV-B regulated the expression of specific responses in the
   metabolism of auxin and abscisic acid as well as in the modification of
   cell walls that could be involved in UV-B acclimation-like processes.
   Conclusion: Our results show the UV-B radiation effects on the leaf
   transcriptome of grapevine (Vitis vinifera cv. Malbec) plantlets.
   Functional categories commonly modulated under both UV-B treatments as
   well as transcripts specifically regulated in an UV-B-intensity
   dependent way were identified. While high fluence rate UV-B had
   regulatory effects mainly on defense or general multiple-stress
   responses pathways, low fluence rate UV-B promoted the expression of
   genes that could be involved in UV-B protection or the amelioration of
   the UV-B-induced damage. This study also provides an extensive list of
   genes regulating multiple metabolic pathways involved in the response of
   grapevine to UV-B that can be used for future researches.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, we identify the coordination environment of Cu2+ in the human
   alpha 1-glycine receptor (GlyR). GlyRs are members of the pentameric
   ligand-gated ion channel superfamily (pLGIC) that mediate fast signaling
   at synapses. Metal ions like Zn2+ and Cu2+ significantly modulate the
   activity of pLGICs, and metal ion coordination is essential for proper
   physiological postsynaptic inhibition by GlyR in vivo. Zn2+ can either
   potentiate or inhibit GlyR activity depending on its concentration,
   while Cu2+ is inhibitory. To better understand the molecular basis of
   the inhibitory effect we have used electron spin resonance to directly
   examine Cu2+ coordination and stoichiometry. We show that Cu2+ has one
   binding site per alpha 1 subunit, and that five Cu2+ can be coordinated
   per GlyR. Cu2+ binds to E192 and H215 in each subunit of GlyR with a 40
   AM apparent dissociation constant, consistent with earlier functional
   measurements. However, the coordination site does not include several
   residues of the agonist/antagonist binding site that were previously
   suggested to have roles in Cu2+ coordination by functional measurements.
   Intriguingly, the E192/H215 site has been proposed as the potentiating
   Zn2+ site. The opposing modulatory actions of these cations at a shared
   binding site highlight the sensitive allosteric nature of GlyR.}},

Abstract = {{We present new deep and accurate space (Advanced Camera for Surveys-Wide
   Field Planetary Camera 2 on board the Hubble Space Telescope) and
   ground-based (Suprime-Cam at Subaru Telescope, Mega-Cam at
   Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope) photometric and astrometric data for the
   Local Group dwarf irregular IC10. We confirm the significant decrease of
   the young stellar population when moving from the center toward the
   outermost regions. We find that the tidal radius of IC10 is
   significantly larger than previous estimates of r(t) less than or
   similar to 10'. By using the I, V -I color-magnitude diagram based on
   the Suprime-Cam data, we detect sizable samples of red giant (RG) stars
   up to radial distances of 18'-23' from the galactic center. The ratio
   between observed star counts (Mega-Cam data) across the tip of the RG
   branch and star counts predicted by Galactic models indicates a star
   count excess at least at a 3 sigma level up to 34'-42' from the center.
   This finding supports the hypothesis that the huge H I cloud covering
   more than 1 degrees across the galaxy is associated with IC10. We also
   provide new estimates of the total luminosity (L(V) similar to 9 x 10(7)
   L(circle dot), MV similar to-15.1 mag) that agree with similar estimates
   available in the literature. If we restrict our study to the regions
   where rotational velocity measurements are available (r approximate to
   13'), we find a mass-to-light ratio (similar to 10 M(circle dot)
   /L(circle dot)) that is at least one order of magnitude larger than
   previous estimates. The new estimate should be cautiously treated, since
   it is based on a minimal fraction of the body of the galaxy.}},

Title = {{Controlled expression of functional miR-122 with a ligand inducible
   expression system}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: To study the biological function of miRNAs, and to achieve
   sustained or conditional gene silencing with siRNAs, systems that allow
   controlled expression of these small RNAs are desirable. Methods for
   cell delivery of siRNAs include transient transfection of synthetic
   siRNAs and expression of siRNAs in the form of short hairpins using
   constitutive RNA polymerase III promoters. Systems employing
   constitutive RNA polymerase II promoters have been used to express
   miRNAs. However, for many experimental systems these methods do not
   offer sufficient control over expression.
   Results: We present an inducible mammalian expression system that allows
   for the conditional expression of short hairpin RNAs that are processed
   in vivo to generate miRNAs or siRNAs. Using modified nuclear receptors
   in a two hybrid format and a synthetic ligand, the Rheoswitch system
   allows rapid and reversible induction of mRNA expression. We evaluated
   the system's properties using miR-122 as a model miRNA. A short hairpin
   encoding miR-122 cloned into the expression vector was correctly
   processed to yield mature miRNA upon induction with ligand and the
   amount of miRNA produced was commensurate with the concentration of
   ligand. miR-122 produced in this way was capable of silencing both
   endogenous target genes and appropriately designed reporter genes.
   Stable cell lines were obtained, resulting in heritable, consistent and
   reversible expression of miR-122, a significant advantage over transient
   transfection. Based on these results, obtained with a microRNA we
   adapted the method to produce a desired siRNA by designing short
   hairpins that can be accurately and efficiently processed.
   Conclusion: We established an Inducible expression system with a miR-122
   backbone that can be used for functional studies of miRNAs and their
   targets, in heterologous cells that do not normally express the miRNA.
   Additionally we demonstrate the feasibility of using the miR-122
   backbone to express shRNA with a desired siRNA guide strand for
   inducible RNAi silencing.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the systematic nucleation detection
   performance of hypothesis testing, histogram matching, and control
   charts based on bulk video imaging. The control charts are built on the
   time series of the bin-by-bin distances between the reference and online
   acquired image histograms. In addition to the bin-by-bin histogram
   measures, the cross-bin earth mover's distance measure has been
   evaluated. Hypothesis testing using the Kolmogorov-Smirnof (KS)
   statistics was also investigated as an additional method to detect
   nucleation. This work is relevant to the crystallization process control
   with in situ seed generation. Following the nucleation step in unseeded
   crystallization processes, it is common to keep the temperature constant
   or to increase it in order to allow the stabilization of the suspension,
   also called the digestion step. The nucleation detection methods
   discussed in this work allow the automated and robust switching between
   the nucleation and digestion steps. It is concluded that histogram
   matching can be successfully used for systematic nucleation detection,
   while the KS hypothesis-testing-based detection is strongly dependent on
   the histogram resolution. Furthermore, it is suggested that histogram
   matching is performed on the first principal components of color images
   in order to decrease the autocorrelation of histogram distance time
   series.}},

   intensity from the magnetized Fe(100) target. We observed that the beam
   polarization exhibited sinusoidal magnetic oscillation after passing
   through the coil. Furthermore, the beam polarization almost completely
   reversed with single periodicity in this oscillation. By comparison with
   the theory of the double-passage nonadiabatic transition, we concluded
   that this oscillation corresponds to the Stuckelberg oscillation in beam
   polarization. Thus, we propose that the quantum interference between the

   naphthol quaternary ammonium salt and binol-derivatives (X = OH, NHR,
   NMe3+, OCOCH3, and L-proline) at 310 and 360 nm resulted in the
   photogeneration of the 2,6-naphthoquinone-6-methide (NQM) and binol
   quinone methide analogues (BQMs) by a water-mediated excited-state
   proton transfer (ESPT). The hydration, the mono- and bis-alkylation
   reactions of morpholine and 2-ethanethiol, as N and S prototype
   nucleophiles, by the transient NQM (lambda(max) 310, 330 nm) and BQMs
   (lambda(max) 360 nm) were investigated in water by product distribution
   analysis and laser flash photolysis (LFP). Both the photogeneration and
   the reactivity of NQM and BQMs exhibited striking differences. BQMs were
   at least 2 orders of magnitude more reactive than NQM, and they were
   generated much more efficiently from a greater variety of
   photoprecursors including the hydroxymethyl, quaternary ammonium salt
   and several binol-amino acids. On the contrary, the only efficient
   precursor of NQM was the quaternary ammonium salt. All water-soluble BQM
   precursors were further investigated for their ability to alkylate and
   cross-link plasmid DNA and oligonucleotides by gel electrophoresis: the
   BQMs were more efficient than the isomeric o-BQM (binol quinone methide
   analogue of 2,3-naphthoquinone-3-methide). Sequence analysis by gel
   electrophoresis, HPLC, and MS showed that the alkylation occurred at
   purines, with a preference for guanine. In particular, a BQM was able to
   alkylate N7 of guanines resulting in depurination at the oligonucleotide
   level, and ribose loss at the nucleotide level. The photoreactivity of
   BQM precursors translated into photocytotoxic and cytotoxic effects on
   two human cancer cell lines: in particular, one compound showed
   promising selectivity index on both cell lines.}},

Abstract = {{Si is an important anode material for the next generation of Li ion
   batteries. Here the energetics and dynamics of Li atoms in bulk Si have
   been studied at different Li concentrations on the basis of first
   principles calculations. It is found that Li prefers to occupy an
   interstitial site as a shallow donor rather than a substitutional site.
   The most stable position is the tetrahedral (T(d)) site. The diffusion
   of a Li atom in the Si lattice is through a T(d)-Hex-T(d) trajectory,
   where the Hex site is the hexagonal transition site with an energy
   barrier of 0.58 eV. We have also systematically studied the local
   structural transition of a Li(x)Si alloy with x varying from 0 to 0.25.
   At low doping concentration (x = 0-0.125), Li atoms prefer to be
   separated from each other, resulting in a homogeneous doping
   distribution. Starting from x = 0.125, Li atoms tend to form clusters
   induced by a lattice distortion with frequent breaking and reforming of
   Si-Si bonds. When x >= 0.1875, Li atoms will break some Si-Si bonds
   permanently, which results in dangling bonds. These dangling bonds
   create negatively charged zones, which is the main driving force for Li
   atom clustering at high doping concentration.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the enthalpies of formation for the homologous series of
   methyl substituted naphthalene isomers were calculated using the AM1,

   the lack of data available for many of these compounds and to find the
   most cost-effective method to calculate the enthalpy of formation. In
   addition, we explored the development of a group-additivity model as a
   fast method to calculate the enthalpy of formation. Using this model,
   two sets of interaction parameters were derived. One set from the G3MP2
   results and the other from the B3PW91 results. These parameters differ
   by an average of 2.3 kJ mol(-1), implying that the simpler B3PW91
   calculations may be used to develop a group-additivity model. The model
   using the G3MP2 derived parameters deviate from the experimental values
   with a RMS of 3.0 kJ mol(-1). Using the B3PW91 parameters, the model has
   an RMS of 9.1 kJ molt. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Objects are one of the most fundamental units in visual attentional
   selection and information processing. Studies have shown that, during
   object-based processing, all features of an attended object may be
   encoded together, even when these features are task irrelevant. Some
   recent studies, however, have failed to find this effect. What
   determines when object-based processing may or may not occur? In three
   experiments, observers were asked to encode object colors and the
   processing of task-irrelevant object shapes was evaluated by measuring
   functional magnetic resonance imaging responses from a brain area
   involved in shape representation. Whereas object-based task-irrelevant
   shape processing was present at low color-encoding load, it was
   attenuated or even suppressed at high color-encoding load. Moreover,
   such object-based processing was short-lived and was not sustained over
   a long delay period. Object-based processing for task-irrelevant
   features of attended objects thus does exist, as reported previously;
   but it is transient and its magnitude is determined by the encoding
   demand of the task-relevant feature.}},

Abstract = {{Chemokines and chemokine receptors are key evolutionary innovations of
   vertebrates. They are involved in morphogenetic processes and play an
   important role in the immune system. Based on an analysis of the
   chemokine receptor gene family in teleost genomes, and the expression
   patterns of chemokine receptor genes during embryogenesis and the
   wounding response in young larvae of Oryzias latipes, we identified the
   chemokine receptor cxcr3a as a marker of innate immune cells. Cells
   expressing cxcr3a were characterized in fish transgenic for a cxcr3a:gfp
   reporter. In embryos and larvae, cxcr3a-expressing cells are motile in
   healthy and damaged tissues, and phagocytic; the majority of these cells
   has the morphology of tissue macrophages, whereas a small fraction has a
   dendritic phenotype. In adults, cxcr3a-positive cells continue to
   specifically express myeloid-associate markers and genes related to
   antigen uptake and presentation. By light microscopy and ultrastructural
   analysis, the majority of cxcr3a-expressing cells has a dendritic
   phenotype, whereas the remainder resembles macrophage-like cells. After
   challenge of adult fish with bacteria or CpG oligonucleotides,
   phagocytosing cxcr3a-positive cells in the blood up-regulated il12p40
   genes, compatible with their function as part of the mononuclear
   phagocytic system. Our results identify a marker of teleost mononuclear
   phagocytic cells and suggest a surprising degree of morphological and
   functional similarity between the innate immune systems of lower and

Abstract = {{Background: Despite the high prevalence of subthreshold depression in
   patients with type 2 diabetes, evidence on cost-effectiveness of
   different therapy options for these patients is currently lacking.
   Methods/Design: Within-trial economic evaluation of the
   diabetes-specific cognitive behaviour therapy for subthreshold
   depression. Patients with diabetes and subthreshold depression are
   randomly assigned to either 2 weeks of diabetes-specific cognitive
   behaviour group therapy (n = 104) or to standard diabetes education
   programme only (n = 104). Patients are followed for 12 months. During
   this period data on total health sector costs, patient costs and
   societal productivity costs are collected in addition to clinical data.
   Health related quality of life (the SF-36 and the EQ-5D) is measured at
   baseline, immediately after the intervention, at 6 and at 12 months
   after the intervention. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and
   cumulative costs will be estimated for each arm of the trial.
   Cost-effectiveness of the diabetes-specific cognitive behaviour group
   therapy will be analysed from the perspective of the German statutory
   health insurance and from the societal perspective. To this end,
   incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of cost per QALY
   gained will be calculated.
   Discussion: Some methodological issues of the described economic
   evaluation are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of repair site gap formation during cyclic loading of
   reconstructed flexor tendons provides important data on the performance
   of repair techniques in the early postoperative period. This study
   describes our cyclic testing protocol and evaluates the relationship
   between changes in optical gap and grip-to-grip displacement. Sixteen
   sheep hind limb deep flexor tendons were randomized into four repair
   groups (n=4 per group): a 2-strand repair (modified Kessler) and
   4-strand repair (Adelaide), both with and without a simple running
   peripheral suture. Repaired tendons were cycled for 1000 cycles at
   appropriate rehabilitation loads for the reconstruction. Tendons were
   paused at 18 predetermined cycle points to measure gap and displacement.
   A strong positively linear relationship between gap and displacement was
   demonstrated for all repair groups (R-2 > 0.90). An initial non-linear
   region during the first 10 cycles was noted with some combined core and
   peripheral repairs. Although trends in displacement after 10 cycles can
   be used to reflect gapping behaviour, direct optical measurement of gap
   remains preferable. We hypothesized that the adjustment of suture
   strands and equilibration of forces within the reconstruction occurs
   mostly during the initial 10 cycles. Gap-cycle curves provide a good
   illustration of dynamic changes at the repair site, and should be added
   more frequently to cyclic testing studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The activation energy for the oxidation of porphyrin monolayers anchored
   to gold surfaces is determined via measurement of the temperature
   dependence of the electron-transfer rates. The activation energy (1)
   increases with increasing surface concentration of the porphyrin and (2)
   is significantly lower (8.1-17 versus 37-49 kJ mol(-1)) when smaller,
   more mobile counterions (Cl- versus PF6-) are used as the supporting
   electrolyte. Regardless, the lower activation energies do not result in
   radically different electron-transfer rates for the different types of
   counterions owing to compensating entropic effects.}},

Abstract = {{Elicitation of antibodies against targets that are immunorecessive,
   cryptic, or transient in their native context has been a challenge for
   vaccine design. Here we demonstrate the elicitation of
   structure-specific antibodies against the HIV-1 gp41 epitope of the
   broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5. This conformationally flexible region
   of gp41 assumes mostly helical conformations but adopts a kinked,
   extended structure when bound by antibody 2F5. Computational techniques
   were employed to transplant the 2F5 epitope into select acceptor
   scaffolds. The resultant ``2F5-epitope scaffolds{''} possessed nanomolar
   affinity for antibody 2F5 and a range of epitope flexibilities and
   antigenic specificities. Crystallographic characterization of the
   epitope scaffold with highest affinity and antigenic discrimination
   confirmed good to near perfect attainment of the target conformation for
   the gp41 molecular graft in free and 2F5-bound states, respectively.
   Animals immunized with 2F5-epitope scaffolds showed levels of
   graft-specific immune responses that correlated with graft flexibility
   (p < 0.04), while antibody responses against the graft-as dissected
   residue-by-residue with alanine substitutions-resembled more closely
   those of 2F5 than sera elicited with flexible or cyclized peptides, a
   resemblance heightened by heterologous prime-boost. Lastly, crystal
   structures of a gp41 peptide in complex with monoclonal antibodies
   elicited by the 2F5-epitope scaffolds revealed that the elicited
   antibodies induce gp41 to assume its 2F5-recognized shape. Epitope
   scaffolds thus provide a means to elicit antibodies that recognize a
   predetermined target shape and sequence, even if that shape is transient
   in nature, and a means by which to dissect factors influencing such
   elicitation.}},

Title = {{Reaction Cycle of the Dissimilatory Sulfite Reductase from Archaeoglobus

Journal = {{BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{41}},
Pages = {{8912-8921}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{A vital process in the biogeochemical sulfur cycle is the dissimilatory
   sulfate reduction pathway in which sulfate (SO42-) is converted to
   hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dSir), its key
   enzyme, hosts a unique siroheme-{[}4Fe-4S] cofactor and catalyzes the
   six-electron reduction of sulfite (SO32-) to H2S. To explore this
   reaction, we determined the X-ray structures of dSir from the archaeon
   Archaeoglobus fulgidus in complex with sulfite, sulfide (S2-), carbon
   monoxide (CO), cyanide (CN-), nitrite (NO2-), nitrate (NO3-), and
   phosphate (PO43-). Activity measurements indicated that dSir of A.
   fulgidus reduces, besides sulfite and nitrite, thiosulfate (S2O32-) and
   trithionate (S3O62-) and produces the latter two compounds besides
   sulfide. On this basis, a three-step mechanism was proposed, each step
   consisting of a two-electron transfer, a two-proton uptake, and a
   dehydration event. In comparison, the related active site structures of
   the assimilatory sulfite reductase (aSir)- and dSir-SO32- complexes
   reveal different conformations of Arg alpha 170 and Lys alpha 211 both
   interacting with the sulfite oxygens (its sulfur atom coordinates the
   siroheme iron), a sulfite rotation of 60 degrees relative to each other,
   and different access of solvent molecules to the sulfite oxygens from
   the active site cleft. Therefore, solely in dSir a further sulfite
   molecule can be placed in van der Waals contact with the
   siroheme-ligated sulfite or sulfur-oxygen intermediates necessary for
   forming thiosulfate and trithionate. Although reported for dSir from
   several sulfate-reducing bacteria, the in vivo relevance of their
   formation is questionable.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE SIGNALING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{144}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{Mammalian platelets are anucleate cells produced by the polyploid
   megakaryocyte. Platelets are more than just key players in hemostasis
   (blood clotting in response to injury); they also have important roles
   in inflammation, immunity, tumor progression, and thrombosis. Complex
   systems of homeostasis have been described for platelets, including
   posttranscriptional and translational mechanisms to regulate platelet
   function. Platelets contain transcription factors, and these proteins
   have essential roles in regulating nongenomic processes. A study
   provides evidence for a previously unknown negative feedback pathway for
   limiting platelet activation that occurs through the nuclear factor B
   transcription factor family. This pathway is mediated by an adenosine
   3',5'-monophosphate-independent protein kinase A activity in response to
   platelet stimulation. Our appreciation of the role of transcription
   factors in mammalian platelet biology is nascent but holds great promise
   for both understanding platelet function and translation into clinical
   uses.}},

Journal = {{BMC CELL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cell scattering is a physiological process executed by stem
   and progenitor cells during embryonic liver development and postnatal
   organ regeneration. Here, we investigated the genomic events occurring
   during this process induced by functional blockade of alpha(5)beta(1)
   integrin in liver progenitor cells.
   Results: Cells treated with a specific antibody against alpha(5)beta(1)
   integrin exhibited cell spreading and scattering, overexpression of
   liver stem/progenitor cell markers and activation of the ERK1/2 and p38
   MAPKs signaling cascades, in a similar manner to the process triggered
   by HGF/SF1 stimulation. Gene expression profiling revealed marked
   transcriptional changes of genes involved in cell adhesion and
   migration, as well as genes encoding chromatin remodeling factors. These
   responses were accompanied by conspicuous spatial reorganization of
   centromeres, while integrin genes conserved their spatial positioning in
   the interphase nucleus.
   Conclusion: Collectively, our results demonstrate that alpha(5)beta(1)
   integrin functional blockade induces cell migration of hepatic
   progenitor cells, and that this involves a dramatic remodeling of the
   nuclear landscape.}},

Title = {{Microbiological pattern of arterial catheters in the intensive care unit}},
Journal = {{BMC MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Intravascular catheter related infection (CRI) is one of the
   most serious nosocomial infections. Diagnostic criteria include a
   positive culture from the catheter tip along with blood, yet in many
   patients with signs of infection, current culture techniques fail to
   identify pathogens on catheter segments. We hypothesised that a
   molecular examination of the bacterial community on short term arterial
   catheters (ACs) would improve our understanding of the variety of
   organisms that are present in this niche environment and would help
   develop new methods for the diagnosis of CRI.
   Results: The whole bacterial community presenting on all ACs was
   evaluated by molecular methods, i.e., a strategy of whole community DNA
   extraction, PCR amplification followed by cloning and 16S rDNA sequence
   analysis. Ten ACs were removed from patients suspected of CRI and 430
   clones from 5 ``colonised{''} and 5 ``uncolonised{''} (semi-quantitative
   method) AC libraries were selected for sequencing and subsequent
   analysis. A total of 79 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were
   identified at the level of 97\% similarity belonging to six bacterial
   divisions. An average of 20 OTUs were present in each AC, irrespective
   of colonisation status. Conventional culture failed to reveal the
   majority of these bacteria.
   Conclusions: There was no significant difference in the bacterial
   diversity between the `uncolonised' and `colonised' ACs. This suggests
   that vascular devices cultured conventionally and reported as non
   infective may at times potentially be a significant source of sepsis in
   critically ill patients. Alternative methods may be required for the
   accurate diagnosis of CRI in critically ill patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was developed as a new
   modality in the surgical diagnosis of lymph node metastases. Dye and
   radioisotope are major tracers for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes
   (SLN). Dye tends to excessively infiltrate into the interstitium due to
   their small size ( less than several nanometers), resulting in
   difficulties in maintaining clear surgical fields. Radioisotopes are
   available in limited number of hospitals. Fluorescent nanoparticles are
   good candidates for SLN tracer to solve these problems, as we can choose
   suitable particle size and fluorescence wavelength of near-infrared.
   However, the use of nanoparticles faces safety issues, and many attempts
   have been performed by giving insulating coats on nanoparticles. In
   addition, the preparation of the uniform insulating layer is important
   to decrease variations in the quality as an SLN tracer.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We herein succeeded in coating
   fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles of 40 nm with uniform silica layer
   of 13 nm by the modified Stober method. The light stability of silica
   coated nanoparticles was 1.3-fold greater than noncoated nanoparticles.
   The popliteal lymph node could be visualized by the silica coated
   nanoparticles with injection in the rat feet.
   Conclusions/Significance: The silica coated nanoparticles in lymph nodes
   could be observed by transmission electron microscope, suggesting that
   our silica coating method is useful as a SLN tracer with highly precise
   distribution of nanoparticles in histological evaluation. We also
   demonstrated for the first time that a prolonged enhancement of SLN is
   caused by the phagocytosis of fluorescent nanoparticles by both
   macrophages and dendritic cells.}},

Abstract = {{The topotactic reduction of the oxychloride Sr3Fe2O5Cl2 with LiH results
   in the formation of Sr3Fe2O4Cl2. Neutron powder diffraction data show
   that Sr3Fe2O4Cl2 adopts a body-centered tetragonal crystal structure
   (14/mmm, a = 4.008(1) angstrom, c = 22.653(1) angstrom at 388 K) with
   anion vacancies located within the SrO layer of the phase. This leads to
   a structure consisting of infinite sheets of corner-sharing Fe(II)04
   square planes. Variable-temperature neutron diffraction data show that
   Sr3Fe2O4Cl2 adopts G-type antiferromagnetic order below T-N similar to
   378(10) K with an ordered moment of 2.81(9) mu(B) per iron center at 5 K
   consistent with the presence of high-spin Fe(II). The observed
   structural and chemical selectivity of the reduction reaction is
   discussed. The contrast between the structure of Sr3Fe2O4Cl2 and the
   isoelectronic all-oxide analogue (Sr3Fe2O5) suggests that by careful
   selection of substrate phases, the topotactic reduction of complex
   transition metal oxychlorides can lead to the preparation of novel
   anion-deficient phases with unique transition metal oxygen sublattices
   which cannot be prepared via the reduction of all-oxide substrates.}},

Pages = {{397-413}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms by which epithelial cells regulate the presence of
   microvilli on their apical surface are largely unknown. A potential
   regulator is EBP50/NHERF1 (ERM-binding phosphoprotein of 50 kD/Na+-H+
   exchanger regulatory factor), a microvillar scaffolding protein with two
   PDZ domains followed by a C-terminal ezrin-binding domain. Using RNAi
   and expression of RNAi-resistant EBP50 mutants we systematically show
   that EBP50 is necessary for microvillar assembly and requires that EBP50
   has both a functional first PDZ domain and an ezrin-binding site
   Expression of mutants mimicking Cdc2 or PKC phosphorylation are
   nonfunctional in microvillar assembly. Biochemical analysis reveals that
   these mutants are defective in PDZ1 accessibility when PDZ2 is occupied,
   and can be rendered functional in vivo by additional mutation of PDZ2
   EBP50 is not necessary for mitotic cell microvilli, and PKC activation
   causes a rearrangement of microvilli on cells due to
   phosphorylation-dependent loss of EBP50 function. Thus, EBP50 is a
   critical factor that regulates microvilli assembly and whose activity is
   regulated by signaling pathways and occupation of its PDZ2 domain.}},

Abstract = {{We discovered the chirality of charge-density waves (CDW) in 1T-TiSe2 by
   using STM and time-domain optical polarimetry. We found that the CDW
   intensity becomes Ia(1):Ia(2):Ia(3) 1:0.7 +/- 0.1:0.5 +/- 0.1, where
   Ia(i) (i = 1, 2, 3) is the amplitude of the tunneling current
   contributed by the CDWs. There were two states, in which the three
   intensity peaks of the CDW decrease clockwise and anticlockwise. The
   chirality in CDW results in the threefold symmetry breaking.
   Macroscopically, twofold symmetry was indeed observed in optical
   measurement. We propose the new generalized CDW chirality H-CDW
   equivalent to q(1) . (q(2) x q(3)), where q(i) are the CDW q vectors,
   which is independent of the symmetry of components. The nonzero
   H-CDW-the triple-q vectors do not exist in an identical plane in the
   reciprocal space-should induce a real-space chirality in CDW system.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that interfacial SiO2, usually formed during high-kappa
   oxide growth on silicon using ozone (O-3), is suppressed during Al2O3
   atomic layer deposition (ALD) by decreasing the O-3 flow rate.
   First-principles calculations indicate that oxygen introduced by the
   first low-dose O-3 exposure is inserted into the surface nucleation
   layer rather than the Si lattice. Subsequent Al2O3 deposition further
   passivates the surface against substrate oxidation. Aluminum methoxy
   {[}-Al(OCH3)(2)] and surface Al-O-Al linkages formed after O-3 pulses
   are suggested as the reaction sites for trimethylaluminum during ALD of
   Al2O3. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics. {[}doi:

Abstract = {{Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal disorder
   characterized by various genetic abnormalities and variable response to
   treatment. About 50\% of patients with AML have no cytogenetic
   aberrations, presenting normal karyotype, and are categorized in the
   intermediate risk group. In this group detection of FLT3 mutations move
   a patient from the intermediate to the adverse risk group.
   Material/Methods: Bone marrow from 80 AML patients was cultured to
   obtain chromosome slides and then karyotype. Simultaneously DNA was
   isolated from bone marrow and PCR reaction was conducted to test the
   FLT3 mutation status (ITD and D835). For statistical analysis Chi
   squared test was used.
   Results: From the group of 80 AML patients seven were classified as a
   favorable risk group and FLT3/ITD was found only in one of these
   patients (14.28\%), and FLT3/D835 in another one (14.28\%). Fifteen
   patients showed a complex karyotype with more than three aberrations or
   with any aberration known as a poor prognosis. Among the adverse group
   FLT3/ITD was detected in three patients (20\%) and D835 mutation in two
   other patients (13.33\%). Among 58 patients with normal karyotype in GTG
   banding FLT3/ITD occurred in six cases (10.34\%) and D835 mutation in
   two cases (3.45\%). No significant difference was found among these
   three risk groups regarding presence or absence of FLT3/ITD and FLTD835.
   Discussion: Molecular characterization of mutations in several genes,
   such as FLT3, NPM1, MLL, CEBPA, in acute myeloid leukemia, especially in
   normal karyotype cases, could be another factor after cytogenetic
   analysis to stratify AML patients into different prognostic categories.}},

Title = {{A Kernelisation Approach for Multiple d-Hitting Set and Its Application
   in Optimal Multi-Drug Therapeutic Combinations}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{Therapies consisting of a combination of agents are an attractive
   proposition, especially in the context of diseases such as cancer, which
   can manifest with a variety of tumor types in a single case. However
   uncovering usable drug combinations is expensive both financially and
   temporally. By employing computational methods to identify candidate
   combinations with a greater likelihood of success we can avoid these
   problems, even when the amount of data is prohibitively large. HITTING
   SET is a combinatorial problem that has useful application across many
   fields, however as it is NP-complete it is traditionally considered hard
   to solve exactly. We introduce a more general version of the problem
   (alpha,beta,d)-HITTING SET, which allows more precise control over how
   and what the hitting set targets. Employing the framework of
   Parameterized Complexity we show that despite being NP-complete, the
   (alpha,beta,d) HITTING SET problem is fixed-parameter tractable with a
   kernel of size O(alpha dk(d)) when we parameterize by the size k of the
   hitting set and the maximum number alpha of the minimum number of hits,
   and taking the maximum degree d of the target sets as a constant. We
   demonstrate the application of this problem to multiple drug selection
   for cancer therapy, showing the flexibility of the problem in tailoring
   such drug sets. The fixed-parameter tractability result indicates that
   for low values of the parameters the problem can be solved quickly using
   exact methods. We also demonstrate that the problem is indeed practical,
   with computation times on the order of 5 seconds, as compared to
   previous Hitting Set applications using the same dataset which exhibited
   times on the order of 1 day, even with relatively relaxed notions for
   what constitutes a low value for the parameters. Furthermore the
   existence of a kernelization for (alpha,beta,d)-HITTING SET indicates
   that the problem is readily scalable to large datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Water deficit stress is one of the important factors limiting chickpea
   production in arid and semi-arid regions of West Asia and North Africa.
   When water deficit stress is imposed, different molecular and
   biochemical responses take place. This study was carried out to
   investigate proline accumulation and protein profiles of leaves in three
   chickpea cultivars under normal watering (I-1: irrigation based on 70 mm
   evaporation from class A pan), progressive water deficit (I-2 and I-3:
   70...90...110...130 and 70...100...130 mm evaporation, respectively) and
   severe water stress (I-4: 130 mm evaporation). The experiment was
   split-plot, based on randomized complete block design (RCBD) in three
   replications. By increasing irrigation intervals, leaf proline content
   increased. Probable stress responsive proteins in relation to imposed
   water deficit stress was carried out by sodium dodecyl sulfate
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method. Water deficit
   stress increased concentration of soluble proteins in the leaves up to
   43\% in comparison with normal watering treatment (I-1: 70...70), but
   did not significantly affect electrophoretic pattern of protein
   profiles. It seems that chickpea can be adapted to progressive water
   deficit stress conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The use of some leguminous crops for soil fertility improvement is being
   promoted for root and tuber crops production in Nigeria. Cowpea has a
   lot of advantages and is more compatible with cassava than other

   8082 at 10,000 plants per hectare) at four plant densities (20,000;
   40,000; 60,000 and 80,000 plants per hectare) in 2004 and 2005 planting
   seasons at the National Root Crops Research Institute (NRCRI) research
   farm in Umudike (07 degrees 33 ` E, 05 degrees 29 ` N), Southeastern
   Nigeria. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block
   design (RCBD) with three replications. The leaf area index (LAI) of
   cassava was highest with the highest cowpea planting density in 2005,
   but not in 2004 planting year. Similarly, maximum fresh root yield
   (t/ha) of cassava was influenced by population density in 2005, but not
   in 2004 planting year. Cassava root yield was highest with the cowpea
   planting density of 80,000 plants/ha. Cowpea variety IT93K- 452-1 at a
   population density of 80, 000 plants/ha is recommended for increased

Title = {{Ras-association domain family 1C protein promotes breast cancer cell
   migration and attenuates apoptosis}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Ras association domain family 1 (RASSF1) gene is a Ras
   effector encoding two major mRNA forms, RASSF1A and RASSF1C, derived by
   alternative promoter selection and alternative mRNA splicing. RASSF1A is
   a tumor suppressor gene. However, very little is known about the
   function of RASSF1C both in normal and transformed cells.
   Methods: Gene silencing and over-expression techniques were used to
   modulate RASSF1C expression in human breast cancer cells.
   Affymetrix-microarray analysis was performed using T47D cells
   over-expressing RASSF1C to identify RASSF1C target genes. RT-PCR and
   western blot techniques were used to validate target gene expression.
   Cell invasion and apoptosis assays were also performed.
   Results: In this article, we report the effects of altering RASSF1C
   expression in human breast cancer cells. We found that silencing RASSF1C
   mRNA in breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB231 and T47D) caused a small but
   significant decrease in cell proliferation. Conversely, inducible
   over-expression of RASSF1C in breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231 and T47D)
   resulted in a small increase in cell proliferation. We also report on
   the identification of novel RASSF1C target genes. RASSF1C down-regulates
   several pro-apoptotic and tumor suppressor genes and up-regulates
   several growth promoting genes in breast cancer cells. We further show
   that down-regulation of caspase 3 via overexpression of RASSF1C reduces
   breast cancer cells' sensitivity to the apoptosis inducing agent,
   etoposide. Furthermore, we found that RASSF1C over-expression enhances
   T47D cell invasion/migration in vitro.
   Conclusion: Together, our findings suggest that RASSF1C, unlike RASSF1A,
   is not a tumor suppressor, but instead may play a role in stimulating
   metastasis and survival in breast cancer cells.}},

Title = {{Bridging frustrated-spin-chain and spin-ladder physics:
   Quasi-one-dimensional magnetism of BiCu2PO6}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{We derive and investigate the microscopic model of the quantum magnet
   BiCu2PO6 using band-structure calculations, magnetic susceptibility and
   high-field magnetization measurements, as well as exact diagonalization
   (ED) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques. The
   resulting quasi-one-dimensional spin model is a two-leg
   antiferromagnetic ladder with frustrating next-nearest-neighbor
   couplings along the legs. The individual couplings are estimated from
   band-structure calculations and by fitting the magnetic susceptibility
   with theoretical predictions, obtained using full diagonalizations. The
   nearest-neighbor leg coupling J(1), the rung coupling J(4), and one of
   the next-nearest-neighbor couplings J(2) amount to 120-150 K while the
   second next-nearest-neighbor coupling is J'(2)similar or equal to
   J(2)/2. The spin ladders do not match the structural chains, and
   although the next-nearest-neighbor interactions J(2) and J'(2) have very
   similar superexchange pathways, they differ substantially in magnitude
   due to a tiny difference in the O-O distances and in the arrangement of
   nonmagnetic PO4 tetrahedra. An extensive ED study of the proposed model
   provides the low-energy excitation spectrum and shows that the system is
   in the strong rung coupling regime. The strong frustration by the
   next-nearest-neighbor couplings leads to a triplon branch with an
   incommensurate minimum. This is further corroborated by a
   strong-coupling expansion up to second order in the inter-rung coupling.
   Based on high-field magnetization measurements, we estimate the spin gap
   of Delta-32 K and suggest the likely presence of antisymmetric
   Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya anisotropy and interladder coupling J(3). We also
   provide a tentative description of the physics of BiCu2PO6 in magnetic
   field, in the light of the low-energy excitation spectra and numerical
   calculations based on ED and DMRG. In particular, we raise the
   possibility for a rich interplay between one- and two-component
   Luttinger liquid phases and a magnetization plateau at 1/2 of the
   saturation value.}},

   intermetallic MAs (M = Mn. or Fe) layers similar to the FeAs layers in
   high-T-c pnictides. Such special structure makes them as interesting
   candidates for new type of superconductor since they have two types of
   superconducting layers. However, our calculations indicate that the
   states in the range from -2.0 eV to +2 0 eV are dominated by Mn-3d or
   Fe-3d states, while the states of Cu-3d are far away from the Fermi
   level (in the range from -3.0 eV to -1.0 eV). Such results are
   significantly different with the Cu-based superconductor, like La2CuO4,
   where the states around Fermi level are dominated by Cu-3d states

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to clarify the origin of Jigoro Kano's
   concept regarding Judo's techniques performed from a distance, and to
   indicate its actualization by Kenji Tomiki, through primary historical
   materials. Kano mentions that judo techniques also include atemi, the
   striking and kicking techniques that are prohibited in ``sport
   randori{''}. Therefore, the style of competitive judo which is now an
   Olympic sport is only one part of judo. Kano was concerned with the
   future of judo due to the deterioration of randori and its becoming
   stiff. He wanted to combine judo's close range techniques with
   techniques performed from a distance in order to create the ideal judo.
   Jiro Nango, the second president of the Kodokan, assembled high-ranking
   judoka at the Kodokan for a lecture about the relationship between judo
   and aiki-budo by Kenji Tomiki. In summer of 1941, a committee for
   studying ``techniques performed while keeping distance in Judo{''} was
   established at the Kodokan. In 1942, Tomiki published an article
   entitled The Systematic Study of Techniques While Maintaining Distance
   in Judo: The Principles of Judo and the Techniques of Aiki-budo. Tomiki
   successfully integrated randori and atemi into one theory using the
   fundamental laws of judo. That was an improvement that Kano did not
   bring about. In particular, Sen and Metsuke are very important
   principles in kendo, swordsmanship as well as aiki-budo.}},

Title = {{Determining optimal replacement time for metal cutting tools}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{206}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{407-416}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{Traditional tool life models do not take into account the variation
   inherent in metal cutting processes. As a consequence, the real tool
   life rarely matches the predicted values. To compensate for this
   uncertainty, tools are usually replaced prematurely, which leads to
   unnecessarily high tool costs. In some cases, however, wear-out occurs
   earlier than predicted, which imposes a risk of workpiece damage or
   rework and can lead to other extra charges. To balance these costs, this
   paper proposes an age replacement model. It is assumed that penalty
   costs are incurred each time a tool fails before the planned
   replacement. The probability of such an event is determined from the
   tool reliability function, which models the wear-out by a mixture of
   Weibull distributions, while failures due to external stresses are
   accounted for by a homogeneous Poisson process. The optimal replacement
   time is then determined from a total time on test (TIT) plot. The
   adequacy of the proposed approach for practical application is tested
   and confirmed in a case study on turning of Inconel 718 with cubic boron
   nitride (CBN) N) tools. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{137}},

Abstract = {{Integrin alpha V can form heterodimers with several beta subunits to
   mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. During
   zebrafish gastrulation, alpha V is expressed maternally and zygotically.
   Here, we used a morpholino-mediated alpha V knockdown strategy to study
   alpha V function. Although alpha V morphants displayed vascular defects,
   they also exhibited left-right body asymmetry defects affecting multiple
   visceral organs. This was preceded by mislocalization of dorsal
   forerunner cells (DFCs) and malformation of the Kupffer's vesicle (KV)
   laterality organ. These defects were rescued with morpholino-resistant
   alpha V mRNA. Like alpha V, integrin beta 1b was expressed in DFCs, and
   beta 1b knockdown largely recapitulated the laterality phenotype of
   alpha V morphants. When tracked in realtime, individual DFCs of both
   morphants showed defects in DFC migration, preventing them from
   organizing into a KV of normal shape and size. Thus, we propose that
   alpha V beta 1b mediates cellular interactions that are necessary for
   DFC clustering and movements necessary for Kupffer's vesicle formation,
   uncovering an early contribution of integrins to the regulation of
   vertebrate laterality.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{392}},

Abstract = {{The reliability with which harvested rainwater can be used as a means of
   flushing toilets, irrigating gardens, and topping off air-conditioner
   serving multifamily residential buildings in New York City is assessed
   using a new rainwater harvesting (RWH) system reliability model.
   Although demonstrated with a specific case study, the model is portable
   because it is based on a nonparametric rainfall generation procedure
   utilizing a bootstrapped markov chain. Precipitation occurrence is
   simulated using transition probabilities derived for each day of the
   year based on the historical probability of wet and dry day state
   changes. Precipitation amounts are selected from a matrix of historical
   values within a moving 15 day window that is centered on the target day.
   RWH system reliability is determined for user-specified catchment area
   and tank volume ranges using precipitation ensembles generated using the
   described stochastic procedure. The reliability with which NYC backyard
   gardens can be irrigated and air conditioning units supplied with water
   harvested from local roofs exceeds 80\% and 90\%, respectively, for the
   entire range of catchment areas and tank volumes considered in the
   analysis. For RWH systems installed on the most commonly occurring
   rooftop catchment areas found in NYC (51-75 m(2)), toilet flushing
   demand can be met with 7-40\% reliability, with lower end of the range
   representing buildings with high flow toilets and no storage elements,
   and the upper end representing buildings that feature low flow fixtures
   and storage tanks of up to 5 m(3). When the reliability curves developed
   are used to size RWH systems to flush the low flow toilets of all
   multifamily buildings found a typical residential neighborhood in the
   Bronx, rooftop runoff inputs to the sewer system are reduced by
   approximately 28\% over an average rainfall year, and potable water
   demand is reduced by approximately 53\%. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

   like carbon (Ti-DLC) thin films were deposited by using reactive-biased
   target ion beam deposition method. The effects of Ti incorporation and
   target bias voltage on the microstructure and mechanical properties of
   the as-deposited films were investigated by means of X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and
   nano-indentation. It was found that the Ti content in Ti-DLC films gets
   increased with increasing target bias voltage. At about 4.2 at.\% of Ti,
   uniform sized well dispersed nanocrystals were seen in the DLC matrix.
   Using FFT analysis, a facility available in the TEM, it was found that
   the nanocrystals are in cubic TiC phase. Though at the core, the
   incorporated Ti atoms react with carbon to form cubic TiC; most of the
   surface exposed Ti atoms were found to react with the atmospheric oxygen
   to form weakly bonded Ti-O. The presence of TiC nanocrystals greatly
   modified the sp(3)/sp(2) hybridized bonding ratio and is reflected in
   mechanical hardness of Ti-DLC films. These films were then tested for
   their biocompatibility by an in vitro cell culturing test. Morphological
   observation and the cell proliferation test have demonstrated that the
   human osteoblast cells well attach and proliferate on the surface of Ti
   incorporated DLC films, suggesting possible applications in bone related
   implant coatings. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Blue Nile supplies the Nile River with the largest proportion of
   water and sediment. Nevertheless, very few, often contrasting data are
   reported in the literature about its sediment yield. This paper deals
   with detailed field measurement of suspended sediment transport taken at
   Khartoum during three flood seasons in the late 1960s. The pattern of
   suspended sediment concentration, discharge and grain-size variation
   with flow is analysed and suspended sediment yield is calculated and
   compared with data from different sources. No bedload transport
   measurements are reported in the literature for the Blue Nile. The flow
   data measured in the field consent to select several dune geometry
   criteria and to adopt the dune bedforms migration method to calculate
   bedload transport. The same procedure is applied also to the bedload
   data measured in four reaches of the Nile River, downstream of the High
   Aswan Dam, with channel and sediment characteristics comparable with
   those of the Blue Nile at Khartoum, to ascertain which dune geometry
   criterion provided the most reliable results. The Bagnold (1980) and
   Martin (2003) equations predict similar values of bedload transport that
   are compared with the very few bedload data assessed by other authors
   using different equations and methods. Finally, a good relation between
   flow velocity and bedload transport rate is found. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {{Thin shone films with the incorporation of nano-dispersed CeO2 particles
   have been deposited by dip-coating over aluminium substrates The shone
   molecule under investigation is bis-1,2-(tnethoxysilypethane (BTSE),
   which has been used as a water-based solution in order to fulfill the
   industry need for reducing the Impact on human health and environment
   The influence of the nano-oxides on the shone was first analyzed in the
   solution by means of 29Si NMR, which showed that the ageing and
   stability of BTSE are not affected by the presence of CeO2 nanoparticles
   in the shone matrix. The chemical interactions between CeO2
   nanoparticles and the BTSE in the cured coating were investigated by
   XPS, and the results pointed to the possible formation of a bond between
   Ce and Si. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), field
   emission Auger electron spectroscopy (FE-AES) and focused ion beam
   coupled with transmission electron microscope (FIB-TEM) were used to
   investigate the film structure and surface morphology. A major challenge
   in the formation of thin layers with the incorporation of nano-oxides is
   to avoid the formation of particles agglomeration, which affects the
   film uniformity and might create preferential paths for corrosion
   attack. This issue has been overcome and the resulting films appear
   uniform and homogeneous, with the nanoparticles well embedded in the
   shone matrix and always covered by a thin shone layer. Electrochemical
   Impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements have been performed on the
   samples and the results show how the barrier properties of the thin
   shone films are improved by the addition of CeO2 nanodispersed particles

Abstract = {{In this study, linseed oil was directly polymerized with different oil
   soluble resoles. p-Ethyl (PEP), p-tertiary butyl (PTB), p-tertiary octyl
   (PTO), and p-phenyl (PPP) phenols were separately reacted with
   formaldehyde to give linseed oil soluble resoles. These were then
   reacted with linseed oil to give transparent rubbery polymers. A model
   reaction was performed with methyl oleate and PTB phenol resole to
   clarify the reaction mechanism. Reaction products were characterized
   with (1)H-NMR and IR techniques. Spectral examination of the model
   reaction showed that polymerization reaction proceeded via ene reaction
   of the quinone methide formed at the end group of the resole with the
   allylic positions of the fatty ester. Rubbery polymers were obtained
   with linseed oil using 10 to 40\% of the different resoles. Hard, load
   bearing and tough materials were obtained at 40\% phenolic resin
   loading. Mechanical properties of the materials were characterized by
   dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) and stress strain tests. The best
   mechanical and thermal properties were obtained with PEP resole which
   showed a storage modulus of 350 MPa and a tan 8 peak at 65 degrees C.
   Storage moduli of 275, 250, and 30 were obtained for PPP, PTB, and PTO
   resoles-linseed oil polymers, respectively. At the same phenolic resin
   loading, elongation at break and swelling ratios in CH(2)Cl(2) increased
   with the longer alkyl substitution on the resole resins. The highest
   thermal stability was observed by PEP resole linseed oil polymer which
   has a 5\% weight loss temperature of 340 degrees C as determined by TGA.
   The lowest thermal stability was observed for PTB resole-linseed oil
   polymer at 220 degrees C. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that highlights the role of the immune
   response during acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
   infection in the control or development of disease. The adaptive immune
   responses do not appear until after HIV-1 infection is already well
   established, so the role of earlier and faster-responding innate
   immunity needs to be more closely scrutinized. In particular, 2 aspects
   of innate immunity for which there are growing research developments
   will be examined in this review: the actions of type I interferons and
   natural killer cells. These two components of the innate immune response
   contribute to viral control both by killing infected cells and by
   modulating other immune cells that develop. However, the role of
   interferon a in immune activation is a double-edged sword, causing
   recruitment of adaptive immune cells that can assist in viral control
   but concurrently contributing to immune activation-dependent disease
   progression. Understanding the complexity of how innate responses affect
   the outcome of HIV-1 infection will help in the development of vaccines
   that can use innate immunity to enhance viral control with minimal
   pathogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{We performed superconducting quantum interference devices and magnetic
   force microscopy (MFM) measurements on magnetic multilayer Co(60
   angstrom)/Ni(90 angstrom)/Co(60 angstrom) nanoscale antidot samples. The
   antidot samples were fabricated on nanochannel glass substrates with
   different antidot diameters and the antidots ordered as a two
   dimensional hexagonal lattice structure. The results indicate that a
   self-organized domain structure is formed due to the pinning effect of
   the antidots. The strong uniaxial anisotropy of Co suppresses the shape
   anisotropy of the antidots and results in an uncommon domain structure.
   The field dependent MFM data reveal a reversal of magnetization. (C)

Abstract = {{The cationic peptide, salmon calcitonin (sCT) was complexed with the
   cationic amphiphilic polyelectrolyte, poly(allyl)amine, grafted with
   palmitoyl and quaternary ammonium moieties at pH 5.0 and 7.4 to yield
   particulates (sCT-QPa). The complexes were approximately 200 nm in
   diameter, had zeta potentials ranging from +20 to +50 mV, and had narrow
   polydispersity indices (PDIs). Differential scanning calorimetry
   revealed the presence of an interaction between sCT and QPa in the
   complexes. Electron microscopy confirmed the zeta-size data and revealed
   a vesicular bilayer structure with an aqueous core. Tyrosine- and Nile
   red fluorescence indicated that the complexes retained gross physical
   stability for up to 7 days, but that the pH 5.0 complexes were more
   stable. The complexes were more resistant to peptidases, serum and liver
   homogenates compared to free sCT. In vitro bioactivity was measured by
   CAMP production in T47D cells and the complexes had EC50 values in the
   nM range. While free sCT was unable to generate CAMP following storage
   for 7 days, the complexes retained approximately 33\% activity. When the
   complexes were injected intravenously to rats, free and complexed sCT
   (pH 5.0 and 7.4) but not QPa reduced serum calcium over 120 min. Free
   and complexed sCT but not QPa also reduced serum calcium over 240 min
   following intrajejunal administration. In conclusion, sCT QPa
   nanocomplexes that have been synthesised are stable, bioactive and
   resistant to a range of peptidases. These enhanced features suggest that
   they may have the potential for improved efficacy when formulated for
   injected and oral delivery. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Naive CD4(+) T cell populations that express TCRs specific for different
   foreign peptide-MHC class II complex (pMHCII) ligands can vary in size
   over several orders of magnitude. This variation may explain why immune
   responses to some peptides are stronger than others. In this study, we
   used a sensitive pMHCII-tetramer-based cell enrichment method to study
   the derivation of two naive foreign pMHCII-specific naive CD4(+) T cell
   populations that differed in size by 8-fold in normal mice. Analysis of
   mice in which thymic negative selection was impaired revealed that the
   smaller population underwent more clonal deletion than the larger
   population. In addition, large naive cell populations tended to
   recognize peptides with tryptophan residues as TCR contacts. Thus, the
   foreign pMHCII that tend to be recognized by large naive populations
   induce minimal clonal deletion and contain certain amino acids with the
   capacity to interact favorably with TCRs. The Journal of Immunology,

Title = {{New PRSS1 and common CFTR mutations in a child with acute recurrent

   pancreatitis?}},
Journal = {{BMC GASTROENTEROLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Background: acute recurrent pancreatitis is a complex multigenic
   disease, the diagnosis is even more difficult when this disease develops
   in a child.
   Case Presentation: a 6-years old boy, hospitalized with epigastric pain
   radiating to the back showed high serum levels of serum amylase, lipase,
   CRP and erythrosedimentation rate. Several similar milder episodes of
   pain, followed by quick recovery and complete disappearance of symptoms
   were reported during the previous 13 months. The child was medically
   treated and after 7 days with normal clinic and laboratory tests was
   discharged with a hypolipidic diet. All the known aetiologic hypotheses
   were excluded by anamnestic investigation, clinical observation and
   biochemical evaluation, whereas, anatomic abnormality were excluded by a
   secretin stimulated magnetic resonance (MRI). At the last follow-up
   visit, (11 months later), the child showed a normal body weight and
   anthropometric profile, without further abdominal pain. Mutation
   screening for coding regions of PRSS1, SPINK1, CFTR and the new
   hereditary pancreatitis-associated chymotrypsin C (CTRC) genes showed a
   novel variation, c.541A > G (p.S181G), in the exon 4 of PRSS1 gene and
   the classical CF p.F508del mutation in the CFTR. Both mutations were
   present in his clinically normal mother and absent in the patient's
   father.
   Conclusions: this report extend the spectrum of PRSS1 mutations,
   however, the absence of family history of pancreatitis leaves the
   present case without the hallmark of the hereditary origin of
   pancreatitis. At the present knowledge it can be only stated that the
   combined genotype CFTR (F508del)/PRSS1(S181G) is associated to a mild
   phenotype of acute recurrent pancreatitis in this child without any
   further conclusion on its pathogenetic role or prediction on the course
   of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin localized at adherens
   junctions (AJs) regulates endothelial barrier function. Because WNT
   (wingless) signaling-induced activation of the transcription factor
   Kruppel-like factor (KLF) 4 may have an important role in mediating the
   expression of VE-cadherin and AJ integrity, we studied the function of
   KLF4 in regulating VE-cadherin expression and the control of endothelial
   barrier function.
   Objective: The goal of this study was to determine the transcriptional
   role of KLF4 in regulating VE-cadherin expression and endothelial
   barrier function.
   Methods and Results: Expression analysis, microscopy, chromatin
   immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and
   VE-cadherin-luciferase reporter experiments demonstrated that KLF4
   interacted with specific domains of VE-cadherin promoter and regulated
   the expression of VE-cadherin at AJs. KLF4 knockdown disrupted the
   endothelial barrier, indicating that KLF4 is required for normal barrier
   function. In vivo studies in mice showed augmented
   lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury and pulmonary edema following
   Klf4 depletion.
   Conclusion: Our data show the key role of KLF4 in the regulation of
   VE-cadherin expression at the level of the AJs and in the acquisition of
   VE-cadherin-mediated endothelial barrier function. Thus, KLF4 maintains
   the integrity of AJs and prevents vascular leakage in response to
   inflammatory stimuli. (Circ Res. 2010;107:959-966.)}},

Abstract = {{Cr-containing hydrogenated amorphous carbon (Cr-C:H) films were
   deposited on silicon substrates using a DC reactive magnetron sputtering
   with Cr target in an Ar and C2H2 gas mixture. The composition, bond
   structure, mechanical hardness and elastic recovery of the films were
   characterized using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and nano-indentation. The
   film tribological behavior was also studied by a ball-on-disc
   tribo-tester. The results showed that the films deposited at low C2H2
   flow rate (<10 sccm) presented a feature of composite Cr-C: H structure,
   which consisted of hard brittle chromium carbide phases and amorphous
   hydrocarbon phase, and thus led to the observed low elastic recovery and
   poor wear resistance of the films. However, the film deposited at high
   C2H2 flow rate (40 sccm) was found to present a typical feature of
   polymer-like a-C: H structure containing a large amount of sp(3) C-H
   bonds. As a result, the film revealed a high elastic recovery, and thus
   exhibited an excellent wear resistance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All

Abstract = {{Titanium and its alloys have been used in dentistry due to their
   excellent corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. It was shown that
   even a pure titanium metal and its alloys spontaneously form a bone-like
   apatite layer on their surfaces within a living body. The purpose of
   this work was to evaluate the growth of calcium phosphates at the
   surface of the experimental alloy Ti-7.5Mo. We produced ingots from pure
   titanium and molybdenum using an arc-melting furnace We then submitted
   these Ingots to heat treatment at 1100 degrees C for one hour, cooled
   the samples in water, and cold-worked the cooled material by swaging and
   machining. We measured the media roughness (Ra) with a roughness meter
   (1.3 and 2.6 mu m) and cut discs (13 mm in diameter and 4 mm in
   thickness) from each sample group. The samples were treated by
   biomimetic methods for 7 or 14 days to form an apatite coating on the
   surface. We then characterized the surfaces with an optical
   profilometer, a scanning electron microscope and contact angle
   measurements. The results of this study indicate that apatite can form
   on the surface of a Ti-7.5Mo alloy, and that a more complete apatite
   layer formed on the Ra = 2 6 mu m material. This Increased apatite
   formation resulted in a lower contact angle (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{An investigation into the equation of state (EOS), electronic and
   elastic properties of Zr2SC has been conducted by first-principles
   pseudopotential calculations. The calculated EOS is well consistent with
   the recent experimental reports. The absence of band gap at the Fermi
   level and the finite value of the density of states at the Fermi energy
   reveal the metallic behavior of Zr2SC. From the variations of elastic
   constants with pressure, we find that hexagonal Zr2SC is most stable in
   the pressure range from 0 to 100 GPa, which is consistent with the
   experimental observations. The strong hybridization of Zr 4d states, S
   3p states and C 2p states and the presence of pseudogap stabilize the
   structure of Zr2SC. By analyzing the ratio between the bulk and shear
   moduli, we conclude that Zr2SC is brittle in nature. The mechanism of
   brittleness of Zr2SC originated from the large value of Zr atom
   occupying the internal parameter z. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published

Abstract = {{The reliability of delta C-13 trends in Neoproterozoic
   carbonate-dominated successions for regional and global
   chemostratigraphic correlation is discussed In the light of recent
   findings of a predominantly non-marine rare earth element and yttrium
   signature in most Neoproterozoic carbonates and a comparatively short
   oceanic residence time of carbon trends towards enrichment in C-13 seen
   in many of these carbonates are considered to reflect facies variations
   rather than temporal signals of ocean chemistry Positive delta
   C-13(Carb) excursions are explained by elevated bioproductivity and/or
   increased evaporation in shallow marine near-coastal temporarily
   restricted depositional environments Examples are provided that
   illustrate that C isotope trends can be highly ambiguous temporal
   markers and are in the absence of other chemostratigraphic data such as
   Sr isotope ratios and radiometric age control of only limited use for
   stratigraphic correlation The overall enrichment in C-13 recorded by
   most Neoproterozoic carbonates except for those in close stratigraphic
   proximity to glacial deposits is suggested to reflect a dominance of
   microbially mediated carbonate formation in the Neoproterozoic This
   might explain why C isotope chemostratigraphy in Neoproterozoic
   successions is less reliable than in Phanerozoic successions in which
   carbonates are with only few exceptions biogenic products of shelly

   probability of reactive sites taking part in the Z-RAFT star
   polymerization are investigated (a) by use of lattice based Monte Carlo
   simulations in combination with exact enumeration techniques and (b) by
   direct simulation applying an off-lattice coarse-grained molecular
   dynamics method (dissipative particle dynamics, DPD). Making use of the
   former method the chain-length dependence of the shielding factors is
   discussed for a broad range of thermodynamic conditions and compared to
   DPD results for the athermal (good solvent) and theta (bad solvent)
   case, i.e., for the limiting solvent qualities evaluated. In addition,
   changes of the size and shape of the reaction partners on approach and
   penetration are discussed in some detail. The results of both simulation
   methods fairly well coincide and reveal that shielding is smaller and
   chain-length dependence less pronounced under theta conditions as
   compared to good solvent conditions. Experimentally determined
   polydispersities of polystyrene generated by Z-RAFT star polymerizations
   in the poor solvent cyclohexane were found to be smaller than with the
   good solvent toluene, which is in full accordance to the theoretical

Abstract = {{Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) complicating percutaneous coronary
   intervention (PCI) results in high mortality, but clinical factors
   associated with and long-term outcomes of GIB are poorly understood. We
   sought to examine clinical and procedural factors associated with GIB
   complicating PCI. We also examined the impact of GIB on 30-day mortality
   and 1-year major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). Patients undergoing PCI
   from January 2000 to January 2010 were retrospectively analyzed for the
   occurrence of in-hospital GIB. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox
   proportional hazards regression were used to identify predictors of
   in-hospital GIB and 30-day mortality. Landmark analysis of patients
   surviving to hospital discharge was performed to assess the impact of
   GIB on 1-year MACEs. Of 20,621 patients who underwent PCI, 147 (0.72\%)
   who developed in-hospital GIB were identified. Variables associated with
   increased risk of GIB included older age, shock, acute myocardial
   infarction, chronic renal insufficiency, lower baseline hematocrit, and
   glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa inhibitors; bivalirudin decreased the risk.
   Unadjusted 30-day mortality rate of patients with GIB was 20.5\%
   compared to 2.4\% of patients without GIB. After multivariable
   adjustment, GIB and shock (and an interaction between the 2) were the
   most important correlates of 30-day mortality. In the population
   surviving to discharge, however, GIB was not associated with adjusted
   mortality or MACEs. In conclusion, GIB complicating PCI has a dramatic
   impact on 30-day mortality, and bivalirudin was associated with lower
   rates of GIB. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. (Am J Cardiol

   investigated using a variety of instrumented indentation techniques on
   binary Ni alloy systems. The measured hardness of the alloys was shown
   to vary as a function of the solute species. For a nominally constant
   level of alloying, additions of Nb, Ta, Rh and Ir were revealed to be
   most potent with respect to enhancing the hardness of the solid
   solution, binary Ni alloys. A modified Labusch relationship was applied
   to correlate the various transition metal solutes to the hardness of the
   alloys and quantify the effectiveness of the elements as solid solution
   strengtheners in Ni. The results of this investigation suggest that the
   dominant mechanism by which solid solution strengthening occurs is not
   due to the localized lattice strains in the proximity of the solute, but
   rather by the nature of the electronic structure interaction and the
   resultant change in stacking fault energy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In colloidal crystals of spheres, dislocation motion is unrestricted. On
   the other hand, recent studies of relaxation in crystals of colloidal
   dimer particles have demonstrated that the dislocation dynamics in such
   crystals are reminiscent of glassy systems. The observed glassy dynamics
   arise as a result of dislocation cages formed by certain dimer
   orientations. In the current study, we use experiments and simulations
   to investigate the transition that arises when a pure sphere crystal is
   doped with an increasing concentration of dimers. Specifically, we focus
   on both dislocation caging and vacancy motion. Interestingly, we find
   that any nonzero fraction of dimers introduces finite dislocation cages,
   suggesting that glassy dynamics are present for any mixed crystal.
   However, we have also identified a vacancy-mediated uncaging mechanism
   for releasing dislocations from their cages. This mechanism is dependent
   on vacancy diffusion, which slows by orders of magnitude as the dimer
   concentration is increased. We propose that in mixed crystals with low
   dimer concentrations vacancy diffusion is fast enough to uncage
   dislocations and delay the onset of glassy dislocation dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Aseptic loosening of orthopaedic implants is induced by wear particles
   generated from the polymeric and metallic components of the implants.
   Substantial evidence suggests that activation of Toll-like receptors
   (TLRs) may contribute to the biological activity of the wear particles.
   Although pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) produced by
   Gram-positive bacteria are likely to be more common in patients with
   aseptic loosening, prior studies have focused on LPS, a TLR4-specific
   PAMP produced by Gram-negative bacteria. Here we show that both TLR2 and
   TLR4 contribute to the biological activity of titanium particles with
   adherent bacterial debris. In addition, lipoteichoic acid, a PAMP
   produced by Gram-positive bacteria that activates TLR2, can, like LPS,
   adhere to the particles and increase their biological activity, and the
   increased biological activity requires the presence of the cognate TLR.
   Moreover, three lines of evidence support the conclusion that TLR
   activation requires bacterially derived PAMPs and that endogenously
   produced alarmins are not sufficient. First, neither TLR2 nor TLR4
   contribute to the activity of ``endotoxin-free{''} particles as would be
   expected if alarmins are sufficient to activate the TLRs. Second,
   noncognate TLRs do not contribute to the activity of particles with
   adherent LPS or lipoteichoic acid as would be expected if alarmins are
   sufficient to activate the TLRs. Third, polymyxin B, which inactivates
   LPS, blocks the activity of particles with adherent LPS. These results
   support the hypothesis that PAMPs produced by low levels of bacterial
   colonization may contribute to aseptic loosening of orthopaedic
   implants.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of Y additions on the hot tearing behaviour of Mg-Zn
   alloys was investigated in this study. In permanent mould castings and
   in direct chill cast ingots, alloying of a few wt.\% Y results in a
   significant reduction of hot tearing susceptibility. The reduced
   susceptibility is attributed to the effect of Y on the solidification
   path at the terminal period of solidification: it increases the solidus
   temperature and thus shortens the solidification path, which in turn
   reduces the terminal freezing range. Via thermodynamic calculations it
   is shown that this is caused by the formation of the ternary phase
   Mg3YZn6. Using a simplified version of Clyne and Davies' model, the
   influence of the terminal freezing range on hot tearing susceptibility
   is clearly illustrated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new, robust homogenization scheme for determination of the effective
   properties of a periodic piezoelectric composite with general
   multi-coated inhomogeneities is developed. In this scheme the coating
   does not have to be thin, the shape and orientation of the inclusion and
   coatings do not have to be identical, their centers do not have to
   coincide, their properties do not have to remain uniform, and the
   microstructure can be with the 2D elliptic or the 3D ellipsoidal
   inclusions. The development starts from the local electromechanical
   equivalent inclusion principle through the introduction of the
   position-dependent equivalent eigenstrain and electric field. Then with
   a Fourier series expansion and a superposition procedure, the
   volume-averaged equivalent eigenstrain and electric field for each phase
   are obtained. The results in turn are used in an energy equivalent
   criterion to determine the effective properties of the composite. In
   this model the interphase interactions in each multi-coated particle and
   the long-range interactions between the periodically distributed
   particles are fully accounted for. To demonstrate its wide range of
   applicability, we applied it to examine the properties of several
   periodic composites: (i) piezoelectric PZT spherical particles in a
   polymer matrix, (ii) continuous glassy fibers with thin PZT coating in
   an epoxy matrix, (iii) spherical PZT particles coated by thick or
   functionally graded piezoelectric layer, (iv) spheroidal voids coated
   with a thick non-piezoelectric layer in a PZT matrix, and (v) spherical
   piezoelectric inhomogeneities with eccentric, non-uniform thickness
   coating. The calculated results reflect the complex nature of interplay
   between the properties of core, matrix, and coating, as well as whether
   the coating is uniform, functionally graded, or eccentric. The accuracy

Abstract = {{Poly(acrylamidoxime-co-2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid)
   (PAMSA) hydrogel was prepared by copolymerization of acrylonitrile and
   2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid as monomer,
   N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) as crosslinking agent and potassium
   peroxodisulfate as initiator. Amidoximated copolymer network was
   prepared by the reaction of copolymer network with hydroxylamine
   hydrochloride. A batch procedure was used for the determination of the
   characteristics of the U(VI) solid phase extraction from the
   amidoximated hydrogel. The determination of U(VI) was performed by
   spectrophotometric method using arsenazo-III as complexing agent.
   Optimal pH value for the quantitative preconcentration was 3, and full
   desorption was achieved with 3 mol L-1 HClO4. The adsorption process can
   be well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the
   equilibrium adsorption isotherm was closely fitted with the Langmuir
   model. A preconcentration factor of 20 and the three sigma detection
   limit of 2.8 mu g L-1 (n = 20) were achieved for uranium(VI) ions. The
   PAMSA hydrogel was used for separating and preconcentrating the uranyl
   ion existing in sea water samples, thermal spring water samples and the
   certified reference materials (TMDA 64; fortified lake water sample).

Abstract = {{The semirestricted non-primitive mean spherical approximation (npmsa) is
   used in combination with the PC-SAFT equation of state to model
   completely dissociating aqueous alkali halide systems. The salts are
   described using ion-specific parameters from tables and correlations.
   Upon analyzing aqueous electrolyte systems at infinite dilution of the
   salt it was concluded that for the arithmetic mean ion diameter of anion
   and cation, the semirestricted npmsa contribution gives no reliable
   results. Therefore, this parameter is adjusted in this work. The model
   was applied to aqueous alkali halide systems up to the solubility limit
   at T = 298.15K. Mean ionic activity coefficients and osmotic
   coefficients were correlated with good results. The model was
   subsequently applied to temperatures up to T = 373.15K and compared to
   liquid densities and to system pressures up to the solubility limit of
   the salts in water. The agreement between experimental data and the
   proposed equation of state is satisfactory for the liquid densities and
   excellent in case of the system pressures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Three lacquer samples taken from a ``four-eared{''} pottery container,
   which was designated an important National Cultural Property of Japan
   excavated in 16-17th century ruins of Kyoto City, were analyzed by
   pyrolysis-gas chromatography! mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and infrared
   (IR) spectroscopy to determine the source of the lacquer. It is an
   unexpected result that the lacquer in this pottery container is actually
   used by Melanorrhoea usitata. Alkylbenzene and alkenylbenzene as
   cleavage pieces of undecylbenzene (MW = 232 g/mol) and undecenylbenzene
   (MW = 230 g/mol), which are products of the pyrolysis of thitsiol, were
   detected in all three samples. Moreover, omega-phenylalkylcatechols and
   omega-phenylalkylphenols, which are the specific components of M.
   usitata, were also detected by Py-GC/MS, suggesting that lacquer sap of
   M. usitata was used by the Japanese people in the 16-17th centuries. In
   addition, Japanese lacquer culture and the advantages of the Py-GC/MS
   method for lacquer analysis are discussed in detail. (C) 2010 Wiley

Abstract = {{NaYF4:Yb,Er micro/nanocrystals with different sizes and morphologies

   CTAB/1-butanol/cyclohexane/aqueous solution. The X-ray diffraction
   analysis confirmed that cubic phase NaYF4:Yb,Er can completely transform
   to hexagonal phase with increasing reaction time. The scanning electron
   microscope and transmission electron microscope images revealed that the
   morphology of the product can be tailored by varying the reaction time.
   A possible crystalline growth process of the NaYF4:Yb,Er
   micro/nanocrystals was discussed. The obtained half opened microtubes
   exhibited an intense green upconversion luminescence, which may be
   attractive in novel optoelectronic devices. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Accurate determination of concentration of immunoglobulin (IgG) to
   tetanus toxoid is important in order to evaluate the immunogenicity of
   tetanus toxoid vaccines, immune competence in individual patients and to
   measure the prevalence of immunity in populations. Surface modified
   polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers were evaluated as a matrix to develop
   highly sensitive method for the detection of anti-tetanus antibody in a
   sandwich ELISA format. In the proposed method tetanus toxoid immobilized
   on modified PAN fibers was used to detect anti-tetanus antibody (raised
   in horse hence represented as horse anti-tetanus toxoid or HAT-Ab) with
   horse raddish peroxidase enzyme conjugated with Rabbit anti-Horse IgG
   (RAH-HRP) as the label within 2.5 h. A sigmoidal pattern for the
   detection of different concentration of antibody ranging from 1.0 to
   0.0001 IU mL(-1) was validated. The immunoassay recorded a very high
   sensitivity as concentration as low as 0.0005 IU mL(-1) of HAT-Ab was
   detected. The intra- and inter-assay precision for 3 parallel
   measurements of 0.01 and for 0.001 IU mL(-1) of antibody varied from
   5.4\% to 11\% and 5.7\% to 20\% respectively. PAN fibers were also used
   to qualitatively access the presence of different level of anti-tetanus
   antibody spiked in human blood. Seroepidemiological studies to measure
   the immunity against tetanus were conducted with twenty-five human
   beings belonging to various age groups using modified PAN-ELISA. The
   sensitivity, specificity and the reproducibility of the developed
   immunoassay indicate the potential application of modified PAN fibers in
   the field of immunodiagnostics. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   precipitation method, the photocatalytic activity over NiO/InBO3
   strongly depended on the calcination temperature and an excess amount of

Abstract = {{Nanocomposite polymers are gaining interest because of their ease of
   preparation and device applications. In this report, synthesis of
   Au-polyvinyl alcohol nanocomposite and rhodamine-6G doped Au-polyvinyl
   alcohol nanocomposite polymer films which are prepared at room
   temperature have been reported. The role of nanosized gold on
   fluorescence properties of rhodamine-6G has been analyzed. Steady state
   fluorescence studies show that the nanoparticles quench the fluorescence
   of rhodamine-6G. Fluoresence quenching were analyzed using all possible
   mechanisms like Forster resonant energy transfer, nanometal surface
   energy transfer and electron transfer to metallic conduction bands. Time
   resolved fluorescence studies reveal that the decay rate changes because
   of the addition of Au nanoparticles and also depends on the size of the
   nanoparticles. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{One of the concerns of the nuclear industry is the deleterious effect of
   hydrogen on the structural integrity of the reactor core components due
   to delayed hydride cracking (DHC). The DHC process occurs when hydrogen
   concentration exceeds the terminal solid solubility (TSS) in the
   component. Thus, the accurate knowledge of TSS is necessary to predict
   the lifetime of the components. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
   is normally used to measure the hydrogen TSS in zirconium alloys. There
   is a measurable change in the amount of heat absorbed by the specimen
   when the hydrides dissolve. The hydride dissolution process does not
   exhibit a well-defined ``sharp{''} change in the heat-flow signal at the
   transition temperature. A typical DSC heat-flow curve for hydride
   dissolution has three definite features; ``peak temperature{''} (PT),
   ``maximum slope temperature{''} (MST) and ``completion temperature{''}.
   The present investigation aims to identify the part of the heat-flow
   signal that closely corresponds to the TSS temperature for hydride
   dissolution (T(TSSD)).
   Coupons were cut from a Zr-2.5Nb specimen, which had been previously
   hydrided using an electrolytic cell to create a surface hydride layer of
   similar to 20 mu m thick on all sides of the specimen. The coupons were
   then annealed isothermally at various temperatures to establish the
   T(TSSD) under equilibrium conditions. Subsequently the hydride layer was
   removed and the coupons were analyzed for TSSD temperature using DSC.
   The PT and MST for each DSC run were determined and compared to the
   annealing temperature of the coupon. The results show that the annealing
   temperature (the equilibrium T(TSSD)) is much closer to the DSC PT than
   any other feature of the heat-flow curve. Crown Copyright (C) 2010

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{CTCF is a multipurpose transcription factor with activation, repression,
   and insulator activity. It also participates in regulating chromatin
   architecture by maintaining open chromatin and mediating long-range
   chromosomal interactions. Participation by CTCF in such diverse
   processes suggests that it has multiple functional domains that regulate
   transcription and modify chromatin structure. Using transient and
   integrated reporters, we identified a 107-amino-acid domain in CTCF's
   N-terminal region that is capable of transcriptional activation and
   chromatin decondensation. This domain demonstrated moderate
   transactivation when targeted to a promoter proximal position but showed
   little activity from more distal positions and on a natural promoter. By
   contrast, the activation domain dramatically decondensed the compact
   chromatin structure of a large transgene array, in a manner similar to
   the potent activation domain in VP16. In addition, the activation domain
   is subject to conjugation by SUMO, which reduced its transcriptional and
   chromatin opening activity. Moreover, mimicking full sumoylation by
   fusing Sumo-1 or -3 to the activation domain eliminated its
   transcriptional activity, but only Sumo-3 fusion prevented chromatin
   opening. We suggest that the activation domain's limited
   transactivation, but strong chromatin decondensation allows CTCF to
   establish and maintain open chromatin without necessarily activating
   transcription. Sumoylation may contribute to CTCF's enhancer blocking or
   repression functions by reducing transactivation and chromatin opening.

Abstract = {{The Drosophila lymph gland (LG) is a model system for studying
   hematopoiesis and blood cell homeostasis. Here, we investigated the
   patterns of division and differentiation of pro-hemocytes in normal
   developmental conditions and response to wasp parasitism, by combining
   lineage analyses and molecular markers for each of the three hemocyte
   types. Our results show that the embryonic LG contains primordial
   hematopoietic cells which actively divide to give rise to a pool of
   pro-hemocytes. We found no evidence for the existence of bona fide stem
   cells and rather suggest that Drosophila pro-hemocytes are regulated as
   a group of cells, rather than individual stem cells. The
   fate-restriction of plasmatocyte and crystal cell progenitors occurs
   between the end of embryogenesis and the end of the first larval instar,
   while Notch activity is required for the differentiation of crystal
   cells in third instar larvae only. Upon parasitism, lamellocyte
   differentiation prevents crystal cell differentiation and lowers
   plasmatocyte production. We also found that a new population of
   intermediate progenitors appears at the onset of hemocyte
   differentiation and accounts for the increasing number of differentiated
   hemocytes in the third larval instar. These findings provide a new
   framework to identify parameters of developmental plasticity of the
   Drosophila lymph gland and hemocyte homeostasis in physiological
   conditions and in response to immunological cues. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{By a theorem of Dobrow and Smythe, the depth of the kth node in very
   simple families of increasing trees (which includes, among others,
   binary increasing trees, recursive trees and plane ordered recursive
   trees) follows the same distribution as the number of edges of the form
   j-(j+1) with j < k. In this short note, we present a simple bijective
   proof of this fact, which also shows that the result actually holds
   within a wider class of increasing trees. We also discuss some related
   results that follow from the bijection as well as a possible
   generalization. Finally, we use another similar bijection to determine
   the distribution of the depth of the lowest common ancestor of two

Abstract = {{Background: Understanding cellular systems requires the knowledge of a
   protein's subcellular localization (SCL). Although experimental and
   predicted data for protein SCL are archived in various databases, SCL
   prediction remains a non-trivial problem in genome annotation. Current
   SCL prediction tools use amino-acid sequence features and text mining
   approaches. A comprehensive analysis of protein SCL in human PPI and
   metabolic networks for various subcellular compartments is necessary for
   developing a robust SCL prediction methodology.
   Results: Based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) and
   metabolite-linked protein interaction (MLPI) networks of proteins, we
   have compared, contrasted and analysed the statistical properties across
   different subcellular compartments. We integrated PPI and metabolic
   datasets with SCL information of human proteins from LOCATE and GOA
   (Gene Ontology Annotation) and estimated three statistical properties:
   Chi-square (chi(2)) test, Paired Localisation Correlation Profile (PLCP)
   and network topological measures. For the PPI network, Pearson's
   chi-square test shows that for the same SCL category, twice as many
   interacting protein pairs are observed than estimated when compared to
   non-interacting protein pairs (chi(2) = 1270.19, P-value < 2.2 x
   10(-16)), whereas for MLPI, metabolite-linked protein pairs having the
   same SCL are observed 20\% more than expected, compared to
   non-metabolite linked proteins (chi(2) = 110.02, P-value < 2.2 x
   10(-16)). To address the issue of proteins with multiple SCLs, we have
   specifically used the PLCP (Pair Localization Correlation Profile)
   measure. PLCP analysis revealed that protein interactions are majorly
   restricted to the same SCL, though significant cross-compartment
   interactions are seen for nuclear proteins. Metabolite-linked protein
   pairs are restricted to specific compartments such as the mitochondrion
   (P-value < 6.0e-07), the lysosome (P-value < 4.7e-05) and the Golgi
   apparatus (P-value < 1.0e-15). These findings indicate that the
   metabolic network adds value to the information in the PPI network for
   the localisation process of proteins in human subcellular compartments.
   Conclusions: The MLPI network differs significantly from the PPI network
   in its SCL distribution. The PPI network shows passive protein
   interaction, possibly due to its high false positive rate, across
   different subcellular compartments, which seem to be absent in the MLPI
   network, as the MLPI network has evolved to maintain high substrate
   specificity for proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the most common cause of acute viral
   hepatitis in the world. Most of South Asia is HEV endemic, with frequent
   seasonal epidemics of hepatitis E and continuous sporadic cases. This
   author group's epidemiologic work and clinical reports suggest that
   Bangladesh is HEV endemic, but there have been few population-based
   studies of this country's HEV burden. The authors calculated HEV
   infection rates, over an 18-month interval between 2003 and 2005, by
   following a randomly selected cohort of 1,134 subjects between the ages
   of 1 and 88 years, representative of rural communities in southern
   Bangladesh. Baseline prevalence of antibody to hepatitis E virus
   (anti-HEV) was 22.5\%. Seroincidence was 60.3 per 1,000 person-years
   during the first 12 months and 72.4 per 1,000 person-years from > 12 to
   18 months (during the monsoon season), peaking by age 50 years and with
   low rates during childhood. Few of the seroconverting subjects reported
   hepatitis-like illness. Overall incidence was calculated to be 64 per
   1,000 person-years, with 1,172 person-years followed. No significant
   associations were found between anti-HEV incidence and demographic or
   socioeconomic factors for which data were available. This is the first
   study to document annual HEV infection rates among ``healthy{''} and
   very young to elderly subjects in a rural Bangladeshi population.}},

Abstract = {{A novel Modified Rachford-Rice equation is developed for three-phase
   equilibrium calculations in hydrocarbon-water systems, based on the
   free-water assumption, i.e., the water-rich liquid phase consists of
   pure water only. In the inner loop of the flash algorithm, the
   three-phase problem (consisting in a system of two non-linear equations)
   is replaced by a pseudo-two-phase problem (consisting in a non-linear
   equation). Unlike previous formulations, the new Modified Rachford-Rice
   function is guaranteed to monotonically decrease between two adjacent
   asymptotes. The negative flash concept is used, and a search window is
   proposed for the vapor fraction. The new free-water flash method proved
   to be robust, and excellent agreement between full three-phase flash and
   pseudo-two-phase free-water flash was obtained for various test
   problems. The proposed method is very useful in compositional reservoir
   simulation of certain oil recovery methods and in process simulation.

Abstract = {{There are many field techniques used to quantify rates of hyporheic
   exchange, which can vary in magnitude and direction spatially over
   distances of only a few metres, both within and between morphological
   features. We used in-stream mini-piezometers and heat transport
   modelling of stream and streambed temperatures to quantify the rates and
   directions of water flux across the streambed interface upstream and
   downstream of three types of in-stream geomorphic features: a permanent
   dam, a beaver dam remnant and a stream meander. We derived hyporheic
   flux estimates at three different depths at six different sites for a
   month and then paired those flux rates with measurements of gradient to
   derive hydraulic conductivity (K) of the streambed sediments. Heat
   transport modelling provided consistent daily flux estimates that were
   in agreement directionally with hydraulic gradient measurements and also
   identified vertical heterogeneities in hydraulic conductivity that led
   to variable hyporheic exchange. Streambed K varied over an order of
   magnitude (1.9 x 10(-6) to 5.7 d 10(-5) m/s). Average rates of hyporheic
   flux ranged from static (q < +/- 0.02 m/day) to 0.42 m/day. Heat
   transport modelling results suggest three kinds of flow around the dams
   and the meander. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution contributed from free-range chicken
   farms (FRCF) is an important source for total phosphorus loads in rural
   watersheds of southern Taiwan. The main objective of this study is to
   quantify the impact of FRCF on water quality parameters. Different
   models were used; first, a distributed rainfall-runoff model and water
   quality models were pre-selected. Their relevant parameters were then
   calibrated and verified based on collected precipitation records, along
   with runoff and water quality data. Since the raising cycle of the
   target chicken farm, located at Longchi Township in southern Taiwan, was
   required for the estimation of NPS loads, three raising cycles per year
   were used in the case study. By using water quality models together with
   relevant parameter values, the unit pollution loads per raising cycle
   during the rainfall period were calculated. The simulated results
   indicate that the higher the rainfall is, the higher the unit pollution
   load per raising cycle will be; confirming that the NPS pollution is
   highly dependent on the change of seasons. The finding clearly indicates
   that the FRCF exerts high potential threat to reservoir. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The authors explored associations between blood gas abnormalities in
   more than 1,000 preterm infants during the first postnatal days and
   indicators of neonatal brain damage. During 2002-2004, women delivering
   infants before 28 weeks' gestation at one of 14 participating
   institutions in 5 US states were asked to enroll in the study. The
   authors compared infants with blood gas values in the highest or lowest
   quintile for gestational age and postnatal day (extreme value) on at
   least 1 of the first 3 postnatal days with the remainder of the
   subjects, with separate analyses for blood gas abnormalities on multiple
   days and for partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolar gas of < 35.
   Outcomes analyzed were ventriculomegaly and an echolucent lesion on an
   ultrasound scan in the neonatal intensive care unit, and cerebral palsy,
   microcephaly, and a low score on a Bayley Scale of Infant Development at
   24 months. Every blood gas derangement (hypoxemia, hyperoxemia,
   hypocapnia, hypercapnia, and acidosis) was associated with multiple
   indicators of brain damage. However, for some, the associations were
   seen with only 1 day of exposure; others were evident with 2 or more
   days' exposure. Findings suggest that individual blood gas derangements
   do not increase brain damage risk. Rather, the multiple derangements
   associated with indicators of brain damage might be indicators of
   immaturity/vulnerability and illness severity.}},

   has been examined. We report here that STAT3 is directly sensitive to
   intracellular oxidants. Oxidation of conserved cysteines by peroxide
   decreased STAT3 binding to consensus serum-inducible elements (SIE) in
   vitro and in vivo and diminished interleukin (IL)-6-mediated reporter
   expression. Inhibitory effects produced by cysteine oxidation in STAT3
   were negated in redox-insensitive STAT3 mutants. In contrast, ROS had no
   effect on IL-6-induced STAT3 recruitment to the c-myc P2 promoter.
   Expression of a redox-insensitive STAT3 in breast carcinoma cells
   accelerated their proliferation while reducing resistance to oxidative
   stress. Our results implicate STAT3 in coupling intracellular redox

Abstract = {{A theoretical model about the size-dependent interface energy between
   two thin films with different materials is developed by considering the
   chemical bonding contribution based on the thermodynamic expressions and
   the structure strain contribution based on the mechanical
   characteristics. The interface energy decreases with reducing thickness
   of thin films, and is determined by such available thermodynamic and
   mechanical parameters as the melting entropy, the melting enthalpy, the
   shear modulus of two materials, etc. The predicted interface energies of
   some metal/MgO and metal/Al2O3 interfaces based on the model are
   consistent with the results based on the molecular mechanics
   calculation. Furthermore, the interface fracture properties of Ag/MgO
   and Ni/Al2O3 based on the atomistic simulation are further compared with
   each other. The fracture strength and the toughness of the interface
   with the smaller structure interface energy are both found to be lower.
   The intrinsic relations among the interface energy, the interface
   strength, and the fracture toughness are discussed by introducing the
   related interface potential and the interface stress. The microscopic
   interface fracture toughness is found to equal the structure interface
   energy in nanoscale, and the microscopic fracture strength is
   proportional to the fracture toughness. (C) 2010 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is commonly used for
   the deposition of silica waveguide layers. When the gaps between
   waveguides are small, voids are created during the deposition of the
   upper cladding. This letter presents a new process for filling the gaps
   of PECVD silica waveguides using boron-germanium codoped upper-cladding
   and high-temperature annealing. Using appropriate doping concentrations
   as determined by processing gas flow rates, the image of completely
   filled gap was observed by scanning electron microscopy, and the
   measured transmission loss of an arrayed waveguide grating triplexer is
   reduced by about 2 dB. By avoiding the use of toxic phosphine, the
   proposed method has potential advantages compared with the commonly used
   borophosphosilicate glass process.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: Pyridine nucleotides regulate the cardiac Na+ current (I-Na)
   through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
   Objective: We investigated the source of ROS induced by elevated NADH.
   Methods and Results: In human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably
   expressing the cardiac Na+ channel, the decrease of I-Na (52 +/- 9\%;
   P<0.01) induced by cytosolic NADH application (100 mu mol/L) was
   reversed by mitoTEMPO, rotenone, malonate, DIDS
   (4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid), PK11195, and
   4'-chlorodiazepam, a specific scavenger of mitochondrial superoxide and
   inhibitors of the mitochondrial complex I, complex II, voltage-dependent
   anion channels, and benzodiazepine receptor, respectively. Anti-mycin A
   (20 mu mol/L), a complex III inhibitor known to generate ROS, decreased
   I-Na (51 +/- 4\%, P<0.01). This effect was blocked by NAD(+), forskolin,
   or rotenone. Inhibitors of complex IV, nitric oxide synthase, the
   NAD(P)H oxidases, xanthine oxidases, the mitochondrial permeability
   transition pore, and the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channel did not
   change the NADH effect on I-Na. Analogous results were observed in
   cardiomyocytes. Rotenone, mitoTEMPO, and 4'-chlorodiazepam also blocked
   the mutant A280V GPD1-L (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like)
   effect on reducing I-Na, indicating a role for mitochondria in the
   Brugada syndrome caused by this mutation. Fluorescent microscopy
   confirmed mitochondrial ROS generation with elevated NADH and ROS
   inhibition by NAD(+).
   Conclusions: Altering the oxidized to reduced NAD(H) balance can
   activate mitochondrial ROS production, leading to reduced I-Na. This
   signaling cascade may help explain the link between altered metabolism,
   conduction block, and arrhythmic risk. (Circ Res. 2010;107:967-974.)}},

Abstract = {{Sericulture is one of the great inventions of the ancient Chinese.
   Besides the mulberry silkworm (Bombyx mori), Chinese farmers developed
   rearing of the Chinese oak silkworm (Antheraea pernyi) about 400 years
   ago. In this paper, the historic records of the origins and dispersal of
   the domesticated Chinese oak silkworm in China are summarized. The first
   document with clearly recorded oak silkworm artificial rearing appeared
   in 1651, although Chinese oak silkworm was documented in about 270 AD.
   All of the evidence in the available historic records suggests that the
   domesticated Chinese oak silkworm originated in central and southern
   areas of Shandong Province in China around the 16th century, and then
   was introduced directly and indirectly by human commerce into the
   present habitations in China after the late 17th century. The results
   strongly support the hypothesis that only one geographically distinct
   event occurred in domestication of the modern Chinese oak silkworm.}},

Abstract = {{This study is focused on the analysis of the relationship between
   sap-flow-derived transpiration measured in a Scots pine stand in the
   Vallcebre research catchments (NE Iberian Peninsula) and meteorological
   and rainfall data. The first part of the study is focused on the
   analysis of temperature and rainfall anomalies. Then, the Scots pine
   transpiration response to inter-annual rainfall variability, soil water
   stress and water table depth variations during the period 1997-2000 is
   analysed. This period includes the extremely dry year of 1998, which
   allows us to infer the response of Scots pine transpiration to severe
   droughts. Scots pine transpiration during the summer presented a high
   inter-annual variability, largely related to rainfall amounts. Daily
   transpiration during dry summers was 40\% of the transpiration of a
   summer day with average rainfall. Moreover, during dry summers,
   transpiration rates were not fully recovered even after significant
   rainfall events. The analysis of the dependence of Scots pine
   transpiration on available water indicated the strong limitation on
   transpiration induced by water content in the whole soil profile as well
   as by water table position. Under these drought conditions, a reduction
   of runoff and deep water stores was observed at the catchment scale,
   suggesting that the predicted increase in the frequency of severe summer
   droughts may threaten the current role of Mediterranean mountain
   catchments as suppliers of water resources for lowland areas. Copyright

Abstract = {{High-resolution multibeam swath-bathymetry and sediment samples were
   collected across the outer shelf region of the Columbretes Islands
   (southern Ebro continental shelf, western Mediterranean Sea).
   Bathymetric data from the submerged part of the Columbretes volcanic
   system revealed the presence of three main relict sand bodies along the
   outer shelf, at 80-116 m depth range, above which asymmetric and
   slightly asymmetric large and very large 2D and 3D subaqueous dunes were
   observed. These bed features were recognized, mapped and quantified with
   the aim of evaluating their potential formation mechanisms in relation
   to the local hydrodynamic and morphologic settings of the area. Dunes
   range from 150 to 760 m in wavelength and from tens of centimeters to 3
   m in height, and are among the longest ever recognized in an outer shelf
   region. These bedforms are mostly composed of medium-sized sandy
   sediments, presumably coming from the degraded relict sand bodies on top
   of which they have developed, mixed with fine fractions from the recent
   draping holocenic sediments. The orientation of the dunes is SSW,
   progressively turning W towards the southernmost sector of the area,
   following the trend of the shelf-edge Contemporary hydrodynamic
   measurements at the Ebro continental shelf-edge show that recorded
   currents are insufficient to form the observed bedforms and that
   stronger currents are required for sediment mobilization and dune
   formation. Based on their morphology and orientation, it is proposed
   that these bedforms are produced by the action of the southward-flowing
   Liguro-Provenc al-Catalan (LPC) geostrophic current. The LPC probably
   reaches high near-bottom currents during energetic hydrodynamic events
   through interactions with the seafloor morphology of the study area.
   Subaqueous dunes are expected to be basically inactive features with
   respect to present-day processes, although they can be reactivated
   during high-energy events. The small Delta h/lambda ratio measured in
   the dune fields of the Columbretes shelf revealed that the dune heights
   fall below the values predicted by the Flemming (1988) global equation,
   as observed in other outer shelf settings also dominated by
   unidirectional flows. This may suggest a different morphodynamic
   character of large dunes formed on outer shelves in a micro-tidal
   regime. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study the solubility of benzoic acid in acetone, 2-propanol,
   acetic acid and cyclohexane was experimentally determined over the
   temperature range of (277-346) K at around 5 K intervals by employing a
   gravimetric method. The experimental results showed that acetone had the
   best solubility for benzoic acid followed by 2-propanol, acetic acid and
   cyclohexane and the solubility in acetic acid had the strongest positive
   temperature dependency. The newly measured solubility data was also
   compared with the available literature data. Several commonly used
   thermodynamic models, including the empirical Van't Hoff equation, the
   lambda h equation, the Wilson, NRTL and UNIQUAC equations, were applied
   to correlate the experimental solubility data. The adjustable parameters
   for each model were optimized by fitting the solubility data measured in
   this work. It was found that the three-parameter NRTL equation could
   give the best correlation results. Better predictions of the solubility
   of benzoic acid in acetic acid at higher temperature were observed using
   the Wilson and UNIQUAC equations than the other three equations which
   all gave underestimations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Membrane wetting by absorbents leads to an Increase in mass transfer
   resistance and a deterioration in CO2 absorption performance during the
   membrane gas absorption process In order to better understand the
   wetting mechanism of membrane pores during their prolonged contact with
   adsorbents, polypropylene (PP) hollow fibers were Immersed in three
   different absorbents for up to 90 days Monoethanolamine,
   methyldiethanolamine, and deionized water were applied as absorbent
   solutions The characterization results of membrane samples confirm that
   the absorbent molecules diffuse into PP polymers during the exposure
   process, resulting in the swelling of the membranes The
   absorption-swelling wetting mechanism is proposed to explain
   observations made during the wetting process The strong reduction of
   contact angles indicates that the membrane surface hydrophobicity
   decreases remarkably during immersion due to membrane-absorbent
   interaction Membrane surface morphologies and surface roughness suffer
   from significant and complicated changes after immersing the membrane
   fibers in the absorbents. Immersion in an absorbent with a high surface
   tension results in small changes in membrane surface morphology. As
   indicated by the experimental results, improving membrane surface
   hydrophobicity may be an effective way of overcoming wetting problems

Abstract = {{A `solvent facilitated' coaxial electrospinning process was used to
   produce reversible narrow temperature gap thermochromic, core-shell
   fibres. A thermochromic composite composed of crystal violet lactone
   (the leuco dye), bisphenol A (the developer) and 1-dodecanol (the
   phase-change solvent) was entrained as core material inside poly(methyl
   methacrylate) shells. A mutual core and shell solvent (chloroform) was
   used to obtain low interfacial tension between the core and shell
   spinning solutions. This enabled room temperature entrainment of the low
   molecular weight, low viscosity core fluid. In order to minimize the
   effect of light scattering and subsequently produce fibres with visible
   colour transitions, the fibres were produced with external diameters of
   3-8 mu m and core diameters of 1.7-5.7 mu m. In order to produce
   core-shell fibres with repeated, reversibly thermochromic behaviour and
   a stable colour developed state, it was necessary to entrain a dye
   composite that contained an excess developer, essentially making this
   composite non-thermochromic prior to entrainment. The fibres were
   analyzed using SEM and DSC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry (UHPLC MS/MS) method suitable for a routine laboratory to
   determine endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids in plasma, plasma
   ultrafiltrate, urine and saliva in a single analytical run. After
   addition of a multi-analyte internal standard, a standardised sample
   preparation procedure with solid phase extraction followed, before
   injecting into a tandem mass spectrometer with positive mode electron
   spray ionisation and multiple reactant monitoring acquisition. The
   chromatography time was 3 min. The limit of quantitation for cortisol
   and cortisone in plasma was 3.75 nmol/L and linearity extended to 2000
   nmol/L The limit of quantitation for cortisol in plasma ultrafiltrate
   and saliva was 0.6 nmol/L The limit of quantitation for 11-deoxycortisol
   and prednisolone was 5 nmol/L and for dexamethasone 1 nmol/L. The
   intra-assay CV was <5\% and the inter-assay CV <10\% for all analytes in
   all matrices. Comparison with an immunoassay (IA) plasma cortisol method
   resulted in a regression equation of UHPLC = 0.79 x IA + 31.12 with R-2

Abstract = {{Skeletal muscle function is impaired in heart failure patients due, in
   part, to loss of myofibrillar protein content, in particular myosin. In
   the present study, we utilized small-amplitude sinusoidal analysis for
   the first time in single human skeletal muscle fibres to measure muscle
   mechanics, including cross-bridge kinetics, to determine if heart
   failure further impairs contractile performance by altering myofibrillar
   protein function. Patients with chronic heart failure (n = 9) and
   controls (n = 6) were recruited of similar age and physical activity to
   diminish the potentially confounding effects of ageing and muscle
   disuse. Patients showed decreased cross-bridge kinetics in myosin heavy
   chain (MHC) I and IIA fibres, partially due to increased myosin
   attachment time (t(on)). The increased t(on) compensated for myosin
   protein loss previously found in heart failure patients by increasing
   the fraction of the total cycle time myosin is bound to actin, resulting
   in a similar number of strongly bound cross-bridges in patients and
   controls. Accordingly, isometric tension did not differ between patients
   and controls in MHC I or IIA fibres. Patients also had decreased calcium
   sensitivity in MHC IIA fibres and alterations in the viscoelastic
   properties of the lattice structure of MHC I and IIA fibres.
   Collectively, these results show that heart failure alters skeletal
   muscle contraction at the level of the myosin-actin cross-bridge,
   leading to changes in muscle mechanics which could contribute to
   impaired muscle function. Additionally, we uncovered a unique kinetic
   property of MHC I fibres, a potential indication of two distinct
   populations of cross-bridges, which may have important physiological
   consequences.}},

Abstract = {{The `simple' view of the mitotic spindle is that it self-assembles as a
   result of microtubules (MTs) randomly searching for chromosomes, after
   which the spindle length is maintained by a balance of outward tension
   exerted by molecular motors on the MTs connecting centrosomes and
   chromosomes, and compression generated by other motors on the MTs
   connecting the spindle poles. This picture is being challenged now by
   mounting evidence indicating that spindle assembly and maintenance rely
   on much more complex interconnected networks of microtubules, molecular
   motors, chromosomes and regulatory proteins. From an engineering point
   of view, three design principles of this molecular machine are
   especially important: the spindle assembles quickly, it assembles
   accurately, and it is mechanically robust - yet malleable. How is this
   design achieved with randomly interacting and impermanent molecular
   parts? Here, we review recent interdisciplinary studies that have
   started to shed light on this question. We discuss cooperative
   mechanisms of spindle self-assembly, error correction and maintenance of
   its mechanical properties, speculate on analogy between spindle and
   lamellipodial dynamics, and highlight the role of quantitative
   approaches in understanding the mitotic spindle design.}},

Title = {{DNA Damage Responses in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells and
   Embryonic Stem Cells}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have the capability to
   undergo self-renewal and differentiation into all somatic cell types.
   Since they can be produced through somatic cell reprogramming, which
   uses a defined set of transcription factors, iPS cells represent
   important sources of patient-specific cells for clinical applications.
   However, before these cells can be used in therapeutic designs, it is
   essential to understand their genetic stability.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we describe DNA damage responses
   in human iPS cells. We observe hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents
   resulting in rapid induction of apoptosis after gamma-irradiation.
   Expression of pluripotency factors does not appear to be diminished
   after irradiation in iPS cells. Following irradiation, iPS cells
   activate checkpoint signaling, evidenced by phosphorylation of ATM,
   NBS1, CHEK2, and TP53, localization of ATM to the double strand breaks
   (DSB), and localization of TP53 to the nucleus of NANOG-positive cells.
   We demonstrate that iPS cells temporary arrest cell cycle progression in
   the G(2) phase of the cell cycle, displaying a lack of the G(1)/S cell
   cycle arrest similar to human embryonic stem (ES) cells. Furthermore,
   both cell types remove DSB within six hours of gamma-irradiation, form
   RAD51 foci and exhibit sister chromatid exchanges suggesting homologous
   recombination repair. Finally, we report elevated expression of genes
   involved in DNA damage signaling, checkpoint function, and repair of
   various types of DNA lesions in ES and iPS cells relative to their
   differentiated counterparts.
   Conclusions/Significance: High degrees of similarity in DNA damage
   responses between ES and iPS cells were found. Even though reprogramming
   did not alter checkpoint signaling following DNA damage, dramatic
   changes in cell cycle structure, including a high percentage of cells in
   the S phase, increased radiosensitivity and loss of DNA damage-induced
   G(1)/S cell cycle arrest, were observed in stem cells generated by
   induced pluripotency.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the spatial arrangement, chemical composition and
   stabilization of soil organic matter (SOM) in nano-size structures
   isolated from a clay fraction of a cultivated Black Chernozem of Canada.
   Both soil fractions were characterized by Transmission Electron
   Microscopy (TEM), Pyrolysis Field Ionization Mass Spectrometry (Py-FIMS)
   and radiocarbon dating, which assisted to better understand the role of
   SOM and inorganic colloids in the stabilization of carbon and nitrogen
   at the nm scale. Observations made by TEM indicated that SOM in
   nano-size fractions occurred mainly in organo-mineral complexes but also
   in solitary structures of humic substances that formed a carbonaceous
   network of single strands linking clusters of humic materials and
   minerals, ranging from a few nm to pm in size. Observations by TEM
   indicate that humic substances facilitated the spatial arrangement of
   minerals, thus contributing to physical and physicochemical
   stabilization of SOM in nano-size structures. The thermal products
   evolved during Py-FIMS analyses showed that SOM had greater thermal
   stability in nano-size structures than in the clay fraction, indicating
   differences in physical adsorption, cross-linking, polymerization,
   and/or polycondensation reactions. The SOM in nano-size structures
   accumulated carbohydrates, N-heterocyclics, peptides, alkylaromatics but
   was depleted in fatty acids, whereas SOM in the clay fraction was
   enriched in phenols, lignin monomers, lipids and fatty acids. Crown

Abstract = {{The critical micelle concentration (cmc) values of cetylpyridinium
   chloride (CPC) were determined in the presence of salicylate and
   benzoate ions in the less explored concentration region where viscosity
   is Newtonian. The cmc of CPC decreased from 9 x 10(-4) to 7 x 10(-7) and
   3 x 10(-6) mol kg(-1) by adding about 0.3 mol kg(-1) of salicylate and
   benzoate. respectively. The ortho hydroxyl group in salicylate thus has
   a remarkable influence on the micellization of CPC and the extent of
   this favorable effect is found to be about 3.5 kJ mol(-1). The
   Coffin-Harkins equation was modified to explain the variation of cmc
   with electrolyte concentration in the presence of mixed counterions. The
   slope of the equation does not provide the value of the total counterion
   binding constant (beta), but gives us information about the lower limit
   to the value of beta, which is found to be 0.66. Addition of salicylate
   and benzoate increases the counterion binding to CPC micelles compared
   to that in the presence of chloride alone. An adsorption isotherm was
   derived to estimate the surface excess of CPC in the presence of mixed
   counterions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Proteolytic enzymes expressed on the surface of tumor cells, and thus
   easily accessible to external interventions, represent useful targets
   for anticancer and antimetastatic therapies. In our study, we thoroughly
   evaluated matriptase, a trypsin-like transmembrane serine protease, as
   potential target for novel inhibitor-based tumor therapies. We applied
   time-domain near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging to characterize
   expression and activity of matriptase in vivo in an orthotopic AsPC-1
   pancreatic tumor model in nude mice. We show strong and tumor-specific
   binding of intravenously injected Cy5.5 labeled antimatriptase antibody
   (MT-Ab{*}Cy5.5) only to primary AsPC-1 tumors and their metastases over
   time within living mice, taking into account fluorescence intensities
   and fluorescence lifetimes of the applied probes. Specific binding of
   MT-Ab{*}Cy5.5 to tumor sites was confirmed by ex vivo NIRF imaging of
   tumor tissue, NIRF microscopy and by coregistration of the in vivo
   acquired NIRF intensity maps to anatomical structures visualized by
   flat-panel volume computed tomography (fpVCT) in living mice. Moreover,
   using an activatable synthetic substrate S{*}DY-681 we could clearly
   demonstrate that matriptase is proteolytically active in vitro as well
   as in vivo in tumor-bearing mice, and that application of synthetic
   active-site inhibitors having high affinity and selectivity toward
   matriptase can efficiently inhibit its proteolytic activity for at least
   24 hr. We thus successfully applied NIRF imaging in combination with
   fpVCT to characterize matriptase as a promising molecular target for
   inhibitor-based cancer therapies.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation and recovery behavior of the device performance on GaN
   LEDs (light emitting diodes) irradiated by 2-MeV electrons and 70-MeV
   protons are studied. The reverse current increases after irradiation,
   while the capacitance decreases. The device performance degradation is
   proportional with the fluence. For electron irradiation, the fluence
   rate also has an impact on the degradation. A low fluence rate shows
   larger degradation compared to a high fluence rate due to heat impact in
   the bulk. DLTS measurements reveal the DX center in the substrate before
   and after irradiation, and the concentration of DX center increases with
   fluence. The radiation damage for protons is larger than that of
   electron irradiation, which is caused by the difference of mass and the
   possibility of nuclear collisions resulting in the formation of lattice
   defects. After irradiation, the diode performance recovers by thermal
   annealing. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The diagnosis of gastric metastasis from lung cancer is relatively rare
   in living patients. We describe a case of Type 4 tumor-like metastasis
   due to primary lung cancer diagnosed with immunohistochemical staining
   while the patient was alive. A 68-year-old man was admitted to our
   hospital because of epigastric pain. Gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed
   a Type 4 tumor and the histological examination showed poorly
   differentiated adenocarcinoma. His chest X-ray showed mass shadow in the
   right upper lung field. The resected specimens showed moderately
   differentiated adenocarcinoma., The diagnosis of gastric metastasis from
   lung cancer was made by immunohistochemical staining of the lung and
   gastric tumors which showed positive staining for Thyroid
   transcriptional factor-1. Diagnosis of gastric metastasis, especially
   Type 4 metastasis by lung cancer is difficult. However,
   immunohistochemical staining is very helpful for diagnosis of primary
   lung cancer metastasis at sites such as the gastrointestinal tract which
   are not normally prone to metastatis. (C) 2010 Baishideng. All rights

Abstract = {{Drying dissipative structures of aqueous dispersions of lycopodium
   particles (31 mu m in average diameter) from the spores of Lycopodium
   clavatum were studied as a function of the particle concentrations in
   the presence and the absence of sodium chloride. The drying patterns
   formed on a cover glass, a watch glass and a Petri glass dish were
   observed macroscopically and microscopically. Lycopodium particles were
   the combination of hemisphere and tetrahedron in their shape and
   possessed the weakly acidic groups on their surfaces. The vague broad
   ring structure was observed even for the very large colloidal particles,
   and their size on a cover glass decreased as particle concentration
   decreased. Microscopic drying patterns almost disappeared except the
   short chain-like patterns. These observations support that the
   convectional contribution on the dissipative drying pattern formation is
   still effective in the lycopodium suspensions, though the convectional
   forces in the suspension are very weak compared with the sedimentation
   forces. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified a
   large number of genetic variants associated with complex trait;, but
   these only explain a small proportion of the total heritability. It has
   been recently proposed that rare variants can create `synthetic
   association' signals in GWAS, by occurring more often in association
   with one of the alleles of a common tag single nucleotide polymorphism.
   While the ultimate evaluation of this hypothesis will require the
   completion of large-scale sequencing studies, it is informative to place
   it in the broader context of what is known about the genetic
   architecture of complex disease. In this review, we draw from empirical
   and theoretical data to summarize evidence showing that synthetic
   associations do not underlie many reported GWAS associations.}},

Abstract = {{P38 alpha MAPK (p38 alpha) is usually activated in response to various
   stresses and plays a role in the inhibition of cell proliferation and
   tumor progression, but little is known about its roles in meiotic
   spindle assembly. In this study, we characterized the dynamic
   localization of p38 alpha and explored its function in mouse oocyte
   meiotic maturation. P38 alpha specifically colocalized with
   gamma-tubulin and Plk1 at the center of MTOCs and spindle poles.
   Depletion of p38 alpha by specific morpholino injection resulted in
   severely defective spindles and misaligned chromosomes probably via MK2
   dephosphorylation. Notably, depletion of p38 alpha led to significant
   spindle pole defects, spindle elongation, non-tethered kinetochore
   microtubules and increased microtubule tension. The disruption of
   spindle stability was coupled with decreased gamma-tubulin and Plk1 at
   MTOCs. Overexpression of Eg5, a conserved motor protein, also caused
   spindle elongation and its morpholino injection almost completely
   rescued spindle elongation caused by p38 alpha depletion. In addition,
   p38 alpha-depletion decreased BubR1 and interfered with spindle assembly
   checkpoint (SAC), which resulted in aneuploid oocytes. Together, these
   data indicate that p38 alpha is an important component of MTOCs, which
   regulates spindle assembly and spindle length, as well as stabilizes the
   spindle and spindle poles. Perturbed SAC and abnormal microtubule
   tension may be responsible for the misaligned chromosomes and high
   aneuploidy in p38 alpha-depleted mouse oocytes.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of ethyl chloride with two model zeolite clusters, each
   including one hydroxyl Bronsted acid site, has been investigated using
   density functional theory (OFT) and MM methods. The first model contains
   three tetrahedral zeolite units (T3) and has been studied at the
   B3LYP(full) level in combination with the 6-311G(d,p) and the cc-pVTZ
   basis sets. The second model is represented by a 12-membered ring (112)
   and has been investigated with the help of the two-layered ONIOM
   (B3LYP/6-31 1G(d,p): UFF) methodology. The reliability of the latter
   method was checked against the optimization of the adsorption complex in
   the T12 cluster at the B3LYP(full)/6-31 1G(d,p) level. The calculations
   show that the reaction mechanism involves two competing channels, a
   direct E2 type dehydrohalogenation channel and a S(N)2 type pathway
   through the intermediate formation of an alkoxy species, the latter
   channel presenting a lower activation energy than the former. The
   overall potential energy surface becomes more attractive when using the
   more realistic T12 framework and the calculated difference in the
   activation energy barrier heights between the two channels increases
   from similar to 1 kcal mo1(-1) in the T3 framework to similar to 4 kcal
   mo1(-1) in T12 model. Finally, the effect of zeolite acidity on the
   reaction barrier is investigated by increasing the length of a terminal
   Si-H bond in the T3 model. The results indicate the distinct reduction
   of the activation barrier as the acidity increases. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The class I MHC-specific receptors expressed by murine NK cells exhibit
   remarkable variation. Specific activating killer Ig-related
   receptor/Ly49 have major effects on autoimmune and infectious disease
   induction and outcome in humans and mice. However, these studies are
   greatly affected by individual background genetics. Furthermore, the
   educational impact of variable inhibitory KIR/Ly49 gene numbers on NK
   cell development and the subsequent ability to survey for MHC class I
   (MHC-I) expression remain unknown. To address these questions, Ly49
   congenic mice were generated that maintain a 129-derived Ly49 gene
   cluster on a C57BL/6 genetic background (B6.Ly49(129) mice), and the in
   vitro and in vivo NK cell function of these mice was compared with their
   inbred parental 129S1 and C57BL/6 counterparts. Notably, target cell
   recognition directed by activating Ly49 receptors was profoundly
   affected by allelic variation in B6.Ly49(129) congenic cells versus
   C57BL/6 NK cells. Furthermore, when assessing NK cell function based on
   education and subsequent recognition of the C57BL/6 MHC-I haplotype by
   inhibitory Ly49 receptors, B6.Ly49(129) congenic mice exhibited robust
   NK cell activity, demonstrating efficient NK cell education by the 129S1
   Ly49 cluster during development. The responsiveness of NK cells
   expressing 129S1 Ly49 was shown to be mediated by subsets expressing one
   or more self-MHC receptors, including Ly49I, Ly49O, Ly49V, and NKG2A.
   These findings demonstrate that the genetically segregating and diverse
   MHC-I and Ly49 loci in mice exhibit independent and epistatic effects on
   NK cell education that can be uncoupled during the intercrossing of
   inbred strains. The Journal of Immunology, 2010, 185: 4783-4792.}},

Abstract = {{Density functional calculations have been utilized to understand the
   interactions of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) with alpha-cyclodextrin
   (alpha-CD) host. An encapsulation of SF6 (guest) within the host cavity
   and its binding to primary as well as secondary hydroxyl rims of
   alpha-CD exhibiting different hydrogen bonding patterns have been
   analyzed. The present calculations have shown that interactions between
   the guest and protons within the host cavity yield the minimum energy
   complex wherein guest penetrates from secondary hydroxyl end of the
   host. Calculated vibrational spectra reveal frequency downshift of S-F
   stretching in the guest molecule on complexation. Frequency shift in
   opposite direction has been noticed for O-H vibrations of secondary
   hydroxyls of the host those facilitate relatively strong hydrogen bonded
   interactions. These inferences have been supported by mapping difference
   molecular electron density on the bond critical points in molecular
   electron density topography. The electronic structure and vibrational
   spectra derived from the density functional calculations based on the
   B3LYP and the X3LYP functional are similar. Use of X3LYP functional
   however, predicts shortening of O6H ... O6' as well as CH ... F hydrogen
   bonds and thus points to the strengthened host-guest interactions and in
   turn binding energies of SF6 within these complexes employing the X3LYP
   functional turn out to be nearly similar to 35-40\% higher compared to
   those obtained within the framework of B3LYP theory. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Oxygen provides the substrate for most ATP production, but also serves
   as a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can induce
   cumulative macromolecular oxidative damage and cause aging. Pure oxygen
   atmospheres (100kPa) are known to strongly reduce invertebrate lifespan
   and induce aging-related physiological changes. However, the nature of
   the relationship between atmospheric oxygen, oxidative stress, and
   lifespan across a range of oxygen levels is poorly known. Developmental
   responses are likely to play a strong role, as prior research has shown
   strong effects of rearing oxygen level on growth, size and respiratory
   system morphology. In this study, we examined (1) the effect of oxygen
   on adult longevity and (2) the effect of the oxygen concentration
   experienced by larvae on adult lifespan by rearing Drosophila
   melanogaster in three oxygen atmospheres throughout larval development
   (10, 21 and 40kPa), then measuring the lifespan of adults in five oxygen
   tensions (2, 10, 21, 40, 100kPa). We also assessed the rate of protein
   carbonyl production for flies kept at 2, 10, 21, 40 and 100kPa as adults
   (all larvae reared in normoxia). The rearing of juveniles in varying
   oxygen treatments affected lifespan in a complex manner, and the effect
   of different oxygen tensions on adult lifespan was non-linear, with
   reduced longevity and heightened oxidative stress at extreme high and
   low atmospheric oxygen levels. Moderate hypoxia (10kPa) extended
   maximum, but not mean lifespan.}},

Abstract = {{Actin filament nucleators initiate polymerization in cells in a
   regulated manner. A common architecture among these molecules consists
   of tandem WASP homology 2 domains (W domains) that recruit three to four
   actin subunits to form a polymerization nucleus. We describe a
   low-resolution crystal structure of an actin dimer assembled by tandem W
   domains, where the first W domain is cross-linked to Cys374 of the actin
   subunit bound to it, whereas the last W domain is followed by the
   C-terminal pointed end-capping helix of thymosin beta 4. While the
   arrangement of actin subunits in the dimer resembles that of a
   long-pitch helix of the actin filament, important differences are
   observed. These differences result from steric hindrance of the W domain
   with intersubunit contacts in the actin filament. We also determined the
   structure of the first W domain of Vibrio parahaemolyticus VopL
   cross-linked to actin Cys374 and show it to be nearly identical with
   non-cross-linked W-Actin structures. This result validates the use of
   cross-linking as a tool for the study of actin nucleation complexes,
   whose natural tendency to polymerize interferes with most structural
   methods. Combined with a biochemical analysis of nucleation, the
   structures may explain why nucleators based on tandem W domains with
   short inter-W linkers have relatively weak activity, cannot stay bound
   to filaments after nucleation, and are unlikely to influence filament
   elongation. The findings may also explain why nucleation-promoting
   factors of the Arp2/3 complex, which are related to tandem-W-domain
   nucleators, are ejected from branch junctions after nucleation. We
   finally show that the simple addition of the C-terminal pointed
   end-capping helix of thymosin beta 4 to tandem W domains can change
   their activity from actin filament nucleation to monomer sequestration.

Abstract = {{The rate of photocatalytic processes can be significantly improved if
   strongly bound products rapidly desorb to free up active sites. This
   paper deals with the rate of desorption of cyclohexanone, the product of
   the liquid-phase photo-oxidation of cyclohexane. Dynamic step-response
   and pulse-response experiments were performed, and the interaction with
   a TiO(2) surface was monitored using ATR FT-IR spectroscopy. A key
   result is that cyclohexanone desorbs readily from unexposed surfaces and
   desorbs an order of magnitude slower from UV-illuminated titania. The
   modification of the surface by UV is reversible: after 2 h without UV
   illumination the surface behaves as an unexposed one. The spectroscopic
   data support an explanation where without illumination, the
   cyclohexanone adsorbs on surface-bound water, from which it readily
   desorbs. Illumination, on the other hand, converts part of this water to
   accessible hydroxyl groups on titania. Cyclohexanone, forming during
   illumination, binds to these Ti-OH groups, and consequently desorbs much
   slower. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{297}},

Abstract = {{A new equation of state for associating fluids has recently been
   presented by Medeiros and Tellez-Arredondo, the Cubic-Two-State Equation
   of State (CT'S EoS) {[}Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 47 (2008) 5723]. This
   equation arises from the coupling of the Soave-Redlich-Kwong EoS (SRK)
   with an association term from a two-state association model. The CTS EoS
   is polynomial in volume and it is able to describe vapor pressures and
   molar volume of associating fluids such as water, alcohol and phenol,
   among others. The equation is also able to describe the liquid-vapor
   equilibria of their mixtures with alkanes. In this paper, the physical
   and thermodynamic foundations of the CTS EoS are further investigated.
   In order to verify its applicability for cross-associating systems, the
   equation was employed in the prediction of phase equilibria behavior of
   binary alcohol-alcohol and water-alcohol mixtures. Very good agreement
   between predictions and experimental phase equilibria data was obtained
   with very simple combining rules and only one adjustable binary
   parameter. No additional parameters were necessary to describe ternary
   systems. With the purpose of checking the model's hypothesis and
   limitations, the two-state association term was coupled with the hard
   sphere Carnahan-Starling EoS, forming the CS-TS equation and the
   association characteristic parameters were determined theoretically for
   prototype association fluids. Monte Carlo NPT simulations of such fluids
   were performed and the results were compared with the equation's
   predictions. The CS-TS was able to describe qualitatively the pvT
   behavior of the prototype; nevertheless, it is not as accurate as those
   predictions obtained from the combination CS with Wertheim's association
   term. It seems that, when adjusting parameters of the CTS EoS to real
   substances, the discrepancies between the predicted and the real
   association contribution are dissipated among other adjustable
   parameters, specially on the dispersive term of the SRK equation.
   Finally, it is shown that CTS EoS isotherms can only have one or three
   real bigger roots than the co-volume for positive pressures, similar to
   cubic equations of state, and then it has the desirable form to describe
   vapor-liquid phase equilibria of associating compounds mixtures. (C)

Title = {{Contribution of Toll-Like Receptor Activation to Lung Damage After Donor

Abstract = {{Introduction. Donor brain death is the first injurious event that can
   produce inflammatory dysfunction after pulmonary transplantation. This
   study was designed to determine whether stimulation of the toll-like
   receptor (TLR) system contributes to the changes produced by brain
   death.
   Materials and Methods. Rats were repeatedly treated with specific
   agonists for TLR4 or TLR2/6 to desensitize these receptors. Brain death
   was then induced by inflation of a balloon catheter within the
   extradural space. Mean arterial pressure changes and inflammatory
   markers were measured serially by protein and mRNA analysis.
   Results. Both desensitizing pretreatments prevented the neurogenic
   hypotension (P<0.001) and metabolic acidosis (P<0.001) observed in
   control animals after brain death. These treatments also reduced the
   levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and CXCL1 in serum and
   bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, although desensitization of TLR4 produced
   a greater inhibition than desensitization of TLR2. Desensitization of
   TLR4 also reduced (P<0.05) expression of the adhesive integrin CD11b on
   blood neutrophils after brain death. Examination of mRNA levels in lung
   tissue 5 hr after brain death showed that desensitization of TLR4
   limited the expression of interferon (IFN)-gamma, IFN beta, and CXCL10,
   whereas desensitization of TLR2/6 reduced only the expression of IFN
   gamma.
   Conclusion. These results indicate that activation of TLR signaling
   pathways can contribute to the lung damage produced by brain death; this
   may increase subsequent graft injury after transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{In cement plants, the substitution of traditional fossil fuels not only
   allows a reduction of CO(2), but it also means to check-out residual
   materials, such as sewage sludge or municipal solid wastes (MSW), which
   should otherwise be disposed somehow/somewhere. In recent months, a
   cement plant placed in Alcanar (Catalonia, Spain) has been conducting
   tests to replace fossil fuel by refuse-derived fuel (RDF) from MSW. In
   July 2009, an operational test was progressively initiated by reaching a
   maximum of partial substitution of 20\% of the required energy. In order
   to study the influence of the new process, environmental monitoring
   surveys were performed before and after the RDF implementation. Metals
   and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) were
   analyzed in soil, herbage, and air samples collected around the
   facility. In soils, significant decreases of PCDD/F levels, as well as
   in some metal concentrations were found, while no significant increases
   in the concentrations of these pollutants were observed. In turn, PM(10)
   levels remained constant, with a value of 16 mu g m(-3). In both
   surveys, the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks derived from
   exposure to metals and PCDD/Fs for the population living in the vicinity
   of the facility were within the ranges considered as acceptable
   according to national and international standards. This means that RDF
   may be a successful choice in front of classical fossil fuels, being in
   accordance with the new EU environmental policies, which entail the
   reduction of CO(2) emissions and the energetic valorization of MSW.
   However, further long-term environmental studies are necessary to
   corroborate the harmlessness of RDF, in terms of human health risks. (C)

Abstract = {{A series of novel in situ polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-sepiolite
   nanocomposites were synthesized by anionic ring opening polymerization
   of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane. These nanocomposites were characterized
   by Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy,
   Wide Angle X-Ray Diffraction (WAXD), Transmission Electron Microscopy
   (TEM), mechanical and dynamic mechanical properties and
   thermogravimetry. This paper highlights the structure-property
   relationship of in situ PDMS-sepiolite nanocomposites and a way to
   improve the mechanical, dynamic mechanical and thermal properties of
   silicone rubber. Comparison of these physico-mechanical properties with
   those of the ex situ nanocomposites reflects greater degree of filler
   dispersion for the in situ nanocomposites. Increasing amount of the
   filler reduced the size of the crystalline domains in PDMS matrix, which
   was evident from the X-Ray and the dynamic mechanical analysis. However,
   the polymer-filler interaction was even more prominent to negate the
   effect of the deterioration of the properties due to decrease in size of
   the microcrystallites. The polymer-filler interaction was reflected in
   the improved mechanical and thermal properties which were the
   consequences of proper dispersion of the filler in the polymer matrix.
   The modulus improvement of the rubber-clay nanocomposites was examined
   by using Guth and Halpin-Tsai model. The temperature of maximum
   degradation was raised by 167 degrees C and improvement of 210\% in
   tensile strength and 460\% in modulus at 100\% elongation was observed.
   These results were correlated with the data obtained from WAXD and TEM
   studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electron transport and self-heating effects are investigated in
   metal-insulator field-effect transistors with a single InAs nanowire
   channel, using a three-dimensional electrothermal Monte Carlo simulator
   based on finite-element meshing. The model, coupling an ensemble Monte
   Carlo simulation with the solution of the heat diffusion equation, is
   carefully calibrated with data from experimental work on these devices.
   This paper includes an electrothermal analysis of the device basic
   output characteristics as well the microscopic properties of transport,
   including current-voltage curves, heat generation and temperature
   distributions, and electron velocity profiles. Despite the low power
   dissipation, results predict significant peak temperatures, due to the
   high power density levels and the poor thermal management in these
   structures. The extent of device self-heating is shown to be strongly
   dependent on both device biasing configuration as well as geometry. (C)

   with Prussian Blue). SAMMS also had higher stability (e.g., 2.5-13-fold

Abstract = {{We present a new method to reconstruct the surface profile of a sample
   from coherent reflectivity data of a white x-ray beam experiment. As an
   example the surface profile of a laterally confined silicon wafer has
   been reconstructed quantitatively from static speckle measurements using
   white coherent x-rays from a bending magnet in the energy range between
   5 < E < 20 keV. As a consequence of using white radiation, speckles
   appear in addition to the Airy pattern caused by scattering at the
   entrance pinhole. Nevertheless, the surface profile of a triangularly
   shaped specimen was reconstructed considering sufficient oversampling
   between the beam-footprint and the effective sample width. For the
   profile reconstruction the Error-Reduction phase retrieval algorithm was
   modified by including the spectral illumination function and a Fresnel
   propagator term. The simultaneous use of different x-ray energies having
   different penetration depth provides information on the evolution of the
   surface profile from the near-surface towards the bulk. The limitations
   of present experiment can be overcome using white or pink radiation from
   a source with higher photon flux. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{This study assessed the futility of proceeding with a Phase 3 clinical
   trial of minocycline as a disease-modifying treatment for Huntington's
   disease (HD). One hundred fourteen research participants with HD were
   randomized, 87 to minocycline (200 mg/d) and 27 to placebo. The change
   in Total Functional Capacity (TFC) score from baseline to Mo 18 was
   prespecified as the primary measure of HD progression. By using a
   futility design, we tested the null hypothesis that minocycline would
   reduce the mean decline in TFC score by at least 25\% compared to a
   fixed value obtained from a historical database, with a one-tailed
   significance level of 10\%. The placebo group was included to facilitate
   blinding. Rejection of the null hypothesis would discourage a major
   definitive trial of minocycline in HD. For the primary analysis, missing
   data were handled by carrying forward the last available observation; a
   secondary analysis used multiple imputations. The mean TFC decline in
   the minocycline group was 1.55 (SD 1.85), and futility was not declared
   (P = 0.12) for the primary analysis. When multiple imputation was used
   to handle missing data, the mean TFC decline in the minocycline group of
   1.71 (SD 1.96, P = 0.07) suggested futility, as was the case for
   prespecified secondary outcome measures. There were no safety
   abnormalities attributable to minocycline. Based on the threshold of
   25\% improvement in TFC, further study of minocycline 200 mg/d in HD was
   not warranted. Futility designs aid in screening potential therapies for
   HD. (C) 2010 Movement Disorder Society}},

Abstract = {{High resolution multi-channel seismic reflection data acquired in the
   offshore domain of the Krishna-Godavari (KG) Basin, provide seismic
   indicators of gas hydrate including bottom-simulating reflectors (BSR),
   and high reflectivity zones below the BSR as an indication of free gas.
   The recent recovery of gas hydrate by drilling across various sites in
   the KG Basin, together with the seismic indicators, suggests overall
   widespread favourable gas hydrate stability conditions. The BSRs provide
   indirect estimates of geothermal gradients and heat flow. A simple
   conductive model is used to calculate heat flow from the depth of the
   BSR. BSR-derived heat flow values range from about 30 to 102 mW/m(2)
   across the KG Basin. We also modeled the base of gas hydrate stability
   zone (BGHSZ) to analyse the linkage between gas hydrate occurrences in
   the basin and its relation to the fault systems in the basin. The
   influence of bottom water temperature, pore water salinity and
   geothermal gradient variation on gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ)
   thickness is analysed in relation to both geological formations and
   tectonics. Our analysis suggests a highly variable GHSZ in the KG Basin
   controlled by local variations in the parameters of stability condition
   and faulting. The BSR-derived heat flow increases towards deeper water
   depths across the basin. Consistent local variations were also observed
   with low heat flow values over prominent topographic highs and high heat
   flow values over the flanks of the topographic highs. This variation may
   be due to focusing and defocusing effects of the topography. However,
   local BSR-depths patterns may also be due to dynamic effects, including
   the displacement of isotherms by thrust-faulting. Additionally, recent
   mass-wasting events and normal faulting resulted in the BGHSZ being too
   shallow relative to the predicted model (which assumed equilibrium
   conditions). Crown Copyright (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the thermal-induced performance of hexagonal
   metastable In2O3 nanocrystals involving in phase transition and
   assembly, with particular emphasis on the assembly for the preparation
   of functional materials. For In2O3 nanocrystals, the metastable phase
   was found to be thermally unstable and transform to cubic phase when
   temperature was higher than 600 degrees C, accompanied by assembly as
   well as evolution of optical properties, but the two polymorphs
   coexisted at the temperature ranging from 600 to 900 degrees C, during
   which the content of product phase and crystal size gradually increased
   upon increasing temperature. The assembly of In2O3 nanocrystals can be
   developed to fabricate In2O3 functional materials, such as various
   ceramic materials, or even desired nano- or micro-structures, by using
   metastable In2O3 nanocrystals as precursors or building blocks. The
   electrical resistivity of In2O3 conductive film fabricated by a
   hot-pressing route was as low as 3.72 x 10(-3) Omega cm, close to that
   of In2O3 single crystal, which is important for In2O3 that is always
   used as conductive materials. The findings should be of importance for
   both the wide applications of In2O3 in optical and electronic devices
   and theoretical investigations on crystal structures. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The accumulation of excess histone proteins in cells has deleterious
   consequences such as genomic instability in the form of excessive
   chromosome loss, enhanced sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and
   cytotoxicity. Hence, the synthesis of histone proteins is tightly
   regulated at multiple steps and transcriptional as well as
   posttranscriptional regulation of histone proteins is well established.
   Additionally, we have recently demonstrated that histone protein levels
   are regulated posttranslationally by the DNA damage checkpoint kinase
   Rad53 and ubiquitin-proteasome dependent proteolysis in the budding
   yeast. However, the underlying mechanism/s via which excess histones
   exert their deleterious effects in vivo are not clear. Here we have
   investigated the mechanistic basis for the deleterious effects of excess
   histones in budding yeast. We find that the presence of excess histones
   saturates certain histone modifying enzymes, potentially interfering
   with their activities. Additionally, excess histones appear to bind
   non-specifically to DNA as well as RNA, which can adversely affect their
   metabolism. Microarray analysis revealed that upon overexpression of
   histone gene pairs, about 240 genes were either up or downregulated by
   2-fold or more. Overall, we present evidence that excess histones are
   likely to mediate their cytotoxic effects via multiple mechanisms that
   are primarily dependent on inappropriate electrostatic interactions
   between the positively charged histones and diverse negatively charged
   molecules in the cell. Our findings help explain the basis for the
   existence of multiple distinct mechanisms that contribute to the tight
   control of histone protein levels in cells and highlight their
   importance in maintaining genomic stability and cell viability.}},

Abstract = {{We present a simple microfluidic fluorescence bead assay for accurately
   measuring antibody-antigen binding kinetics with a standard inverted
   fluorescent microscope. We measured association and dissociation rate
   constants from antibody-antigen interactions spanning nearly 4 orders of
   magnitude in equilibrium binding affinity (30 pM-100 nM). Two versions
   of this assay are presented, which allow for dissociation rate
   measurements either directly, by use of fluorescently labeled antigen,
   or indirectly, by use of unlabeled antigen. We also demonstrate
   simultaneous, multiplexed binding measurements of multiple
   antibody-antigen interactions using a combination of spectral separation
   and spatial localization. Complete antibody-antigen binding kinetics
   were measured for as little as 8 x 10(4) antibody molecules (similar to
   132 zeptomoles) immobilized on a single bead and less than 2 x 10(6)
   antibodies (similar to 3 attomoles) loaded into the microfluidic device,
   a reduction in detection limit and sample consumption of 4 orders of
   magnitude when compared to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy
   and alternative measurement techniques. We show that the microfluidic
   bead assay, when combined with small volume compartmentalization,
   enables direct measurement of antigen binding kinetics of antibodies
   secreted from single hybridoma cells. We anticipate that this assay will
   be useful as a routine analytical tool for studying molecular
   interactions as well as for screening primary antibody-secreting plasma
   cells isolated from immunized animals.}},

Abstract = {{RNA splicing is required to remove introns from pre-mRNA, and
   alternative splicing generates protein diversity. Topoisomerase I (Top1)
   has been shown to be coupled with splicing by regulating
   serine/arginine-rich splicing proteins. Prior studies on isolated genes
   also showed that Top1 poisoning by camptothecin (CPT), which traps Top1
   cleavage complexes (Top1cc), can alter RNA splicing. Here, we tested the
   effect of Top1 inhibition on splicing at the genome-wide level in human
   colon carcinoma HCT116 and breast carcinoma MCF7 cells. The RNA of
   HCT116 cells treated with CPT for various times was analyzed with
   ExonHit Human Splice Array. Unlike other exon array platforms, the
   ExonHit arrays include junction probes that allow the detection of
   splice variants with high sensitivity and specificity. We report that
   CPT treatment preferentially affects the splicing of splicing-related
   factors, such as RBM8A, and generates transcripts coding for inactive
   proteins lacking key functional domains. The splicing alterations
   induced by CPT are not observed with cisplatin or vinblastine and are
   not simply due to reduced Top1 activity, as Top1 downregulation by short
   interfering RNA did not alter splicing like CPT treatment. Inhibition of
   RNA polymerase II (Pol II) hyperphosphorylation by
   5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) blocked the
   splicing alteration induced by CPT, which suggests that the rapid Pol II
   hyperphosphorylation induced by CPT interferes with normal splicing. The
   preferential effect of CPT on genes encoding splicing factors may
   explain the abnormal splicing of a large number of genes in response to
   Top1cc. Cancer Res; 70(20); 8055-65. (C) 2010 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{Lysis of bacterial cells is considered a key step in biological
   treatment process of waste activated sludge. Most cells in waste
   activated sludge are long-cultured cells in stationary- or death-phases,
   which are proved more difficult to be lysed than actively-growing cells.
   However, few attentions have been paid to the lysis of long-cultured
   cells. In this study, synergistic action of different lytic enzymes from
   two thermophilic bacteria, Geobacillus spp. SY9 and SY14, were
   discovered to promote the lysis of long-cultured cells. The
   combinational action of the lytic enzymes from the two thermophilic
   bacteria were significantly better than their individual action and the
   cell lysis rates at the optimized combinational ratio were higher than
   that of their individual action by 2-3 times. The results of selective
   inhibition test infer that the potential lytic enzymes of SY9 and SY14
   are glycosidase and peptidase, respectively. Hence, the combinational
   action of different lyric enzymes is a potential measure to promote the
   lysis of long-cultured cells. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC)-associated renal
   tumors are aggressive and tend to metastasize early. There are currently
   no effective forms of therapy for patients with advanced
   HLRCC-associated kidney cancer. We have previously shown that HLRCC
   cells express a high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the
   present study we investigated the cytotoxiceffects of increasing ROS
   level using bortezomib in combination with cisplatin on HLRCC cells in
   vitro and in an in vivo xenograft model. The cytotoxic effect of several
   ROS inducers on FH-deficient cells was assessed by synthetic lethality.
   ROS inducers had a pronounced impact on the viability of FH-deficient
   cells. Because of its high potency, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
   was further investigated. Bortezomib induced apoptosis in vitro in HLRCC
   cells and inhibited HLRCC tumour growth in vivo. Bortezomib-associated
   cytotoxicity was highly correlated with cellular ROS level: combining
   bortezomib with other ROS inducers enhanced cytotoxicity, while
   combining bortezomib with a ROS scavenger inhibited its cytotoxic
   effect. Finally, HLRCC murine xenografts were treated with bortezomib
   and cisplatin, another ROS inducer. This regimen induced HLRCC tumour
   regression in vivo. These findings suggest that increasing ROS level in
   HLRCC above a certain threshold can induce HLRCC-tumor cell death.
   Increasing tumor ROS with bortezomib in combination with cisplatin
   represents a novel targeted therapeutic approach to treat advanced
   HLRCC-associated renal tumors.}},

Abstract = {{A bioanalytical assay for pravastatin and two isomeric metabolites,
   3'alpha-isopravastatin and 6'-epipravastatin, was developed and
   validated. Mouse plasma and tissue homogenates from liver, kidney, brain
   and heart were pre-treated using protein precipitation with acetonitrile
   containing deuterated internal standards of the analytes. The extract
   was diluted with water and injected into the chromatographic system.
   This system consisted of a polar embedded octadecyl silica column using
   isocratic elution with formic acid in a water-acetonitrile mixture. The
   eluate was transferred to an electrospray interface using negative
   ionization and the analytes were detected and quantified with the
   selected reaction monitoring mode of a triple quadrupole mass
   spectrometer. The assay was successfully validated in a 3.4-7100 ng/ml
   concentration range for pravastatin, 1.3-2200 ng/ml for
   3'alpha-isopravastatin and 0.5-215 ng/ml for 6'-epipravastatin using
   only plasma for calibration. For plasma samples, subjected to full
   validation, within and between day precisions were 1-7\% (9-18\% at the
   LLQ level) and accuracies were between 91\% and 103\%. For tissue
   homogenates, subjected to partial validation, within and between day
   precisions were 2-12\% (6-19\% at the LLQ level) and accuracies were
   between 87\% and 113\% (81 and 113\% at the LLQ level). Drug and
   metabolites were shown to be chemically stable under most relevant
   analytical conditions. Finally, the assay was successfully applied for a
   pilot study in mice. After intravenous administration of the drug, all
   isomeric compounds were found in plasma; however, in liver and kidney
   homogenate only the parent drug showed levels exceeding the LLQ. (C)

Abstract = {{Cytokine secretion by leukocytes is an important indicator of immune
   response to pathogens and therefore has significant implications in
   disease diagnostics. Given heterogeneity of leukocyte subsets and the
   ability of multiple cell subsets to secrete the same cytokines,
   connecting cytokine production to a specific leukocyte subset is a
   distinct challenge. In the present paper we describe a strategy
   combining antibody (Ab)-based affinity cell separation and surface
   plasmon resonance (SPR) for capturing human CD4 T-cells and for
   label-free detection of cell-secreted interferon (IFN)-gamma - an
   important inflammatory cytokine. Human blood was introduced into a flow
   chamber modified with anti-CD4 Abs resulting in capture of CD4(+)
   T-cells. After mitogenic activation of cells inside the flow chamber,
   culture medium was routed onto an SPR chip modified with monoclonal
   IFN-gamma Abs. SPR signal observed in this experiment correlated with
   cytokine production by T-cells. The strategy of combining SPR detection
   with cell purification may be used in the future for label-free,
   sensitive detection of multiple cytokines or proteins secreted by the
   desired cell subset. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Most Chinese rivers have experienced great changes in discharge and
   sediment during the past 50 years. This study attempts to examine the
   long-term dynamics of riverine carbon flux in the Xijiang River by
   applying the relationships between riverine carbon concentrations and
   discharge or sediment to the historical discharge and sediment records.
   Results show that POC (particulate organic carbon) flux in the Xijiang
   has experienced a decreasing trend, caused by reduced sediment supply.
   However, DOC (dissolved organic carbon) shows an increasing trend. Human
   activities including reservoir/dam construction and
   domestic/agricultural effluents may intensify the upward trend of DOC.
   DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) shows a declining trend with a very
   small slope. Variation of DIC accords well with discharge/precipitation.
   For total carbon flux, a more or less constant, or very small decreasing
   trend is displayed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, the availability of chitosan was systematically
   investigated for removal of bisphenol A (BPA,
   2,2-bis(hydroxyphenyl)propane) through the tyrosinase-catalyzed quinone
   oxidation and subsequent quinone adsorption on chitosan beads. In
   particular, the process parameters, such as the hydrogen peroxide
   (H2O2)-to-BPA ratio, pH value, temperature, and tyrosinase dose, were
   discussed in detail for the enzymatic quinone oxidation.
   Tyrosinase-catalyzed quinone oxidation of BPA was effectively enhanced
   by adding H2O2 and the optimum conditions for BPA at 0.3 mM were
   determined to be pH 7.0 and 40 degrees C in the presence of H2O2 at 0.3
   mM ({[}H2O2]/{[}BPA] = 1.0). Removal of BPA from aqueous solutions was
   accomplished by adsorption of enzymatically generated quinone
   derivatives on chitosan beads. The use of chitosan in the form of beads
   was found to be more effective because heterogeneous removal of BPA with
   chitosan beads was much faster than homogeneous removal of BPA with
   chitosan solutions, and the removal efficiency was enhanced by
   increasing the amount of chitosan beads dispersed in the BPA solutions
   and BPA was completely removed by quinone adsorption in the presence of
   chitosan beads more than 0.10 cm(3)/cm(3). In addition, a variety of
   bisphenol derivatives were completely or effectively removed by the
   procedure constructed in this study, although the enzyme dose or the
   amount of chitosan beads was further increased as necessary for some of
   the bisphenol derivatives used. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl

   paramagnetic phase of these samples greatly depresses the magnetic
   entropy: the vertical bar Delta S-M(max)vertical bar values are well
   below the values expected without considering the effect of SRMO.
   Moreover, the analysis of the MCE using Landau theory of phase
   transition shows that the contributions to the free energy from the

Abstract = {{A MIMO (multiple inputs and multiple outputs) fuzzy-logic-based model
   was developed to predict biogas and methane production rates in a
   pilot-scale 90-L mesophilic up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)
   reactor treating molasses wastewater. Five input variables such as
   volumetric organic loading rate (OLR), volumetric total chemical oxygen
   demand (TCOD) removal rate (R-V), influent alkalinity, influent pH and
   effluent pH were fuzzified by the use of an artificial
   intelligence-based approach. Trapezoidal membership functions with eight
   levels were conducted for the fuzzy subsets, and a Mamdani-type fuzzy
   inference system was used to implement a total of 134 rules in the
   IF-THEN format. The product (prod) and the centre of gravity (COG,
   centroid) methods were employed as the inference operator and
   defuzzification methods, respectively. Fuzzy-logic predicted results
   were compared with the outputs of two exponential non-linear regression
   models derived in this study. The UASB reactor showed a remarkable
   performance on the treatment of molasses wastewater, with an average
   TCOD removal efficiency of 93 (+/-3)\% and an average volumetric TCOD
   removal rate of 6.87 (+/-3.93) kg TCODremoved/m(3)-day, respectively.
   Findings of this study clearly indicated that, compared to non-linear
   regression models, the proposed MIMO fuzzy-logic-based model produced
   smaller deviations and exhibited a superior predictive performance on
   forecasting of both biogas and methane production rates with
   satisfactory determination coefficients over 0.98. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Helicases are motor proteins of biological system, which catalyze the
   opening of energetically stable duplex nucleic acids in an ATP-dependent
   manner and thereby are involved in almost all aspects of nucleic acid
   metabolism including cell cycle progression. They contain several
   conserved domains including the DEAD-box and also several unique domains
   associated with these. The Pfam database (http://pfam.janelia.org/) is a
   large collection of protein families, each represented by multiple
   sequence alignments and hidden Markov models (HMMs). A diverse range of
   proteins are found in nature, and the functional specificity to each
   protein, to a greater extent, is imparted by its domain architecture. To
   this extent, a DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase (LOC\_Os01g36890;
   Genomic sequence length: 6284 nucleotides; CDS length: 1,299
   nucleotides; Protein length: 432 amino acids) was studied. The protein
   sequence was imported for domain search on Pfam. This particular Pfam
   entry after covering a large proportion of sequences in the underlying
   database has generated a more comprehensive coverage across a wide range
   of phyla of the known domains that are associated with the typical
   DEAD-box helicase motif. A total of 362 domain architectures were
   recollected from the Pfam database for the Family: DEAD (PF00270). We
   have therefore systematically analyzed the domains closely associated
   with DEAD-motif, which occur in a variety of proteins and can provide
   insights into their function.}},

Title = {{Influence of Apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I Structure on Nascent High Density
   Lipoprotein (HDL) Particle Size Distribution}},

Abstract = {{The principal protein of high density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein
   (apo) A-I, in the lipid-free state contains two tertiary structure
   domains comprising an N-terminal helix bundle and a less organized
   C-terminal domain. It is not known how the properties of these domains
   modulate the formation and size distribution of apoA-I-containing
   nascent HDL particles created by ATP-binding cassette transporter A1
   (ABCA1)-mediated efflux of cellular phospholipid and cholesterol. To
   address this issue, proteins corresponding to the two domains of human
   apoA-I (residues 1-189 and 190-243) and mouse apoA-I (residues 1-186 and
   187-240) together with some human/mouse domain hybrids were examined for
   their abilities to form HDL particles when incubated with either
   ABCA1-expressing cells or phospholipid multilamellar vesicles.
   Incubation of human apoA-I with cells gave rise to two sizes of HDL
   particles (hydrodynamic diameter, 8 and 10 nm), and removal or
   disruption of the C-terminal domain eliminated the formation of the
   smaller particle. Variations in apoA-I domain structure and physical
   properties exerted similar effects on the rates of formation and sizes
   of HDL particles created by either spontaneous solubilization of
   phospholipid multilamellar vesicles or the ABCA1-mediated efflux of
   cellular lipids. It follows that the sizes of nascent HDL particles are
   determined at the point at which cellular phospholipid and cholesterol
   are solubilized by apoA-I; apparently, this is the rate-determining step
   in the overall ABCA1-mediated cellular lipid efflux process. The
   stability of the apoA-I N-terminal helix bundle domain and the
   hydrophobicity of the C-terminal domain are important determinants of
   both nascent HDL particle size and their rate of formation.}},

Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Alkali earth metal silicides MSi (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) are multi-phase
   compound and exist simultaneously in CrB, CsCl, NaCl or rock salt (RS)
   and zinc blende (zb) structures. In the CrB and CsCl phases, their
   behavior is metallic in the non-magnetic (NM) as well as the
   ferromagnetic (FM) structure. The total spin magnetic moment of these
   compounds in the zb phase is more than that in the corresponding RS
   phase; therefore, detailed studies for the zb phase are presented in
   this paper. This study includes structural, electronic and mechanical
   properties by using the full potential linear augmented plain wave
   scheme with local orbitals. Ferromagnetic CaSi, SrSi and BaSi show true
   half-metallic character. For a better understanding of the
   half-metallicity in the above-mentioned sp-type compounds, their band
   structures have been calculated and densities of state plots have been
   produced. The FM structures are more stable and harder than the
   corresponding NM structures. The magnetic moment corresponding to
   equilibrium lattice constants is calculated as 2 mu B for FM CaSi, SrSi
   and BaSi, which are in accordance with the earlier work on the sp-type
   compounds CaC, SrC and BaC. The FM character changes to the paramagnetic
   character as the lattice parameter decreases. The general trend is that
   the values of the elastic constants C-11, C-12 and C-44 increase with
   increasing hydrostatic pressure.}},

Abstract = {{TBC1D1 (tre-2/USP6, BUB2, cdc16 domain family member 1) is a Rab-GAP
   (GTPase-actvating protein) that is highly expressed in skeletal muscle,
   but little is known about TBC1D1 regulation and function. We studied
   TBC1D1 phosphorylation on three predicted AMPK (AMP-activated protein
   kinase) phosphorylation sites Ser(231), Ser(660) and Ser(700)) and one
   predicted Akt phosphorylation site (Thr(590)) in control mice, AMPK
   alpha 2 inactive transgenic mice (AMPK alpha 2i TG) and Akt2-knockout
   mice (Akt2 KO) Muscle contraction significantly increased TBC1D1
   phosphorylation on Ser(231) and Ser(660). tended to increase Ser(700)
   phosphorylation. but had no effect on Thr(590) AICAR
   (5-ammoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside) also increased
   phosphorylation on Ser231. Ser(660) and Ser(700) but not Thr(590).
   whereas insulin only increased Thr(590) phosphorylation. Basal and
   contraction-stimulated TBC1D1 Ser(231), Ser(660) and Ser(700)
   phosphorylation were greatly reduced in AMPK alpha 2i TG mice. although
   contraction still elicited a small increase in phosphorylation Akt2 KO
   mice had blunted insulin-stimulated TBC1D1 Thr(590) phosphorylation
   Contraction-stimulated TBC1D1 Ser(231) and Ser(660) phosphorylation were
   normal in high-fat-fed mice. Glucose uptake in vivo was significantly
   decreased in tibialis anterior muscles overexpressing TBC1D1 mutated on
   four predicted AMPK phosphorylation sites In conclusion, contraction
   causes site-specific phosphorylation of TBC1D1 in skeletal muscle, and
   TBC1D1 phosphorylation on AMPK sites regulates contraction-stimulated
   glucose uptake. AMPK and Akt regulate TBC1D1 phosphorylation, but there
   must be additional upstream kinases that mediate TBC1D1 phosphorylation
   in skeletal muscle}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to compare the incidence of
   hand-foot syndrome (HFS) in patients who received pyridoxine versus
   placebo during pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) chemotherapy for
   recurrent ovarian, breast, or endometrial cancer. METHODS: Patients
   received PLD 40 mg/m(2) for a maximum of 6 cycles. Patients were
   assigned randomly to receive pyridoxine 100 mg twice daily (Group A) or
   placebo (Group B) and received standard HFS education. Patients
   completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy quality-of-life
   (QOL) questionnaire. The incidence of HFS as measured by common toxicity
   criteria was compared between groups. Analyses were conducted according
   to an intent-to-treat basis. Chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests were
   used. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were enrolled (18 in Group A and 16
   in Group B), and 5 patients were unevaluable for HFS assessment.
   Overall, 15 of 29 patients (52\%) had HFS (all grades), and 10 of 29
   patients (35\%) had grade 2/3 events. Eight of 15 patients in Group A
   (53\%) and 7 of 14 patients in Group B (50\%) had HFS (P=.857). For
   grade 2/3 events, there was no difference between groups: Six of 15
   events (40\%) occurred in Group A, and 4 of 14 events (29\%) occurred in
   Group B (P=.70). There was no difference in QOL scores between patients
   who had grade 2/ 3 HFS and patients who had grade 0/1 HFS. QOL analysis
   revealed that all patients had elevated social well being. CONCLUSIONS:
   Pyridoxine as administered in the current study did not prevent HFS in
   patients who received PLD. It is possible that QOL is not compromised in
   patients with HFS because they may have increased social well being
   while coping with their disease. Cancer 2010; 116: 4735-43. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The environmental load from consumption can be reduced by changing
   consumption patterns. For an effective consumer policy to reduce the
   environmental load from society, we need insight into the environmental
   load from consumption patterns. This requires detailed accurate
   quantitative environmental information about many consumer products.
   Current methods for establishing this information about many consumer
   products do not combine process data with multiregional data. This paper
   aims to give more insight into the added value of using multiregional
   data and process data. It also proposes to combine both kinds of data
   into one application. The use of multiregional input-output data appears
   to be important to establish the total environmental load from
   consumption. Using multiregional data and process data both result in
   substantial changes in the estimated environmental load of consumption
   products on a more detailed level. The results indicate that using both
   multiregional and process data will improve the estimates of the
   environmental impacts of consumption patterns. Therefore, we propose a
   hybrid multi-region (HMR) method, which is successfully applied for the
   Netherlands. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Novel bifunctional magnetic-photoluminescent nanofibers based on Fe2O3
   nanoparticles and europium complex Eu(DBM)(3)(Bath) (DBM =
   dibenzoylmethanate, Bath = bathophenanthroline) have been prepared by
   electrospinning. Extensive characterizations of the resulting
   bifunctional nanofibers have been performed using X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy
   dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The influence on
   photoluminescence properties of bifunctional nanofibers of the addition
   of Fe2O3 nanoparticles has also been studied. The results indicate that
   due to decreased symmetry in the composite nanofibers the excitation
   bands of the composite nanofibers are split into two different
   components. Furthermore, the existence of the Fe2O3 and polymer hybrid
   matrixes can improve the thermal and photo stability of the europium
   complex and elongate the fluorescence lifetime of the europium complex.

Abstract = {{In this study, we reported on the incorporation of a novel
   supramolecular hydrogel into agarose hydrogel to create a hybrid
   hydrogel. Both the supramolecular hydrogel and the hybrid hydrogel were
   characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence
   microscopy, and their mechanical properties were evaluated by a compress
   assay. These results showed that the hybrid hydrogel possessed much
   better mechanical properties and stability than the supramolecular
   hydrogel itself. The hybrid hydrogel could be applied to efficiently
   remove methyl violet from an aqueous phase without affecting its
   appearance under vigorous stirring, while the supramolecular hydrogel
   changed to a fragile solid after the absorption of a large amount of
   methyl violet even under the free-standing mode. Such a hybrid hydrogel
   has the potential for use in the efficient removal of dye molecules from
   aqueous solutions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling and refining behaviors of software systems are two crucial
   issues in the methodology of Model-Driven Development (MDD). Traditional
   methods include Unified Modeling Language (UML) based methods and formal
   methods. Recently integrated methods by taking full advantages of these
   two methods have received increasing attention. Unfortunately, there are
   still no effective formal modeling and automatic refinement methods for
   behaviors. Besides, difficulties exist in generating some structures,
   e.g., explicit loop structures, via existing approaches.
   In this paper, we propose a B-notations based framework for formal
   modeling and automatically refining behaviors. In our framework, three
   issues are involved: automatic behavior modeling, theory of behavior
   refinement, and automatic behavior refinement. For automatic behavior
   modeling, we propose a B-notation based automatic modeling method for
   behaviors. For theory of behavior refinement, we propose a refinement
   theory focusing on behaviors that regards the behavior refinement
   problem as a search problem. For automatic behavior refinement, we
   propose an automatic refinement approach by combining top-down logic
   reduction based method and bottom-up local search based method, where
   explicit loop structures can be well generated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Spin-splitting energies of wurtzite AlN and InN are calculated using the

   utilizing the two-band k . p model. It is found that in the k . p
   scheme, a spin-degenerate surface exists in the wurtzite Brillouin zone.
   Consequently, the D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation mechanism can be
   effectively suppressed for all spin components in the {[}001]-grown
   wurtzite quantum wells (QWs) at a resonant condition through application
   of appropriate strain or a suitable gate bias. Therefore, wurtzite QWs
   (e.g., InGaN/AlGaN and GaN/AlGaN) are potential structures for
   spintronic devices such as the resonant spin lifetime transistor. (C)

Abstract = {{A natural way for capturing uncertainty in the relational data model is
   by allowing relations that violate their primary key. A repair of such
   relation is obtained by selecting a maximal number of tuples without

   Boolean query q, CERTAINTY(q) is the problem that takes as input a
   relational database and asks whether q evaluates to true on every repair
   of that database. In recent years, CERTAINTY(q) has been studied
   primarily for conjunctive queries. Conditions have been determined under
   which CERTAINTY(q) is coNP-complete, first-order expressible, or not
   first-order expressible. A remaining open question was whether there
   exist conjunctive queries q without self-join such that CERTAINTY(q) is
   in PTIME but not first-order expressible. We answer this question

Abstract = {{Liquid and liquid/gas flows through spacer filled channels were studied
   using Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) to pi vide experimental support
   for velocity distributions obtained from Computational Fluid Dynamics
   studies available in the literature It is shown that Ply is a suitable
   technique for measuring velocity profiles in spacer filled channels,
   although care has to be taken when interpreting the results. PIV
   measurements were carried out for an entire flow cell (5 cm x 15 cm), a
   smaller area of roughly 7 mm x 8 mm and for a single spacer cell (2.5 mm
   x 3 mm) The experimental results show that fluid flow is well
   distributed across the entire flow cell in the case of single-phase flow
   The recordings of the single spacer cell showed that liquid flow is
   mainly parallel to the spacer filaments and therefore the direction of
   flow changes 90 over the height of the channel Introduction of air
   bubbles introduced strong local velocity gradients The liquid velocity
   in two-phase flows is shown to be more unsteady than in the case of
   single-phase flow, which is advantageous when trying to prevent fouling
   or concentration polarization. (C) 2010 Elsevier B V. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper was to investigate the critical aggregation
   concentration and aggregation number of acid-soluble collagen from
   walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) skin using the fluorescence
   probe pyrene. Results showed that pyrene was fit for studying the
   aggregation behaviour of collagen in sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.2.
   The plots of the pyrene l(1)/l(3) ratio, as a function of the logarithm
   of total collagen concentration, revealed a typical sigmoidal decrease,
   the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) from which was determined
   to be at 0.48 mg/ml. The subsequent transient fluorescence decay study
   indicated that the aggregation number of collagen was not constant, but
   varied with different concentrations of collagen. The structure of the
   aggregates tended to be stable, when the collagen concentration exceeded
   1.2 mg/ml. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic and optical properties of layered compounds LnMnPO (Ln = Nd,

   semiconductor LaMnPO. Diffuse reflectance spectra and temperature
   dependent electrical conductivity indicate that the LnMnPO compounds are
   semiconductors with band gap energies of 0.7-0.8 eV. Electrical
   conductivity at RT is varied from 4 x 10(-3) to 2.5 S cm(-1) by Cu
   doping for NdMnPO. Nominally undoped LnMnPO compounds exhibit negative
   Seebeck coefficients due presumably to P deficiency, while the sign of
   the Seebeck coefficients is changed to positive by doping of Ca or Cu to
   the Ln sites, indicating that the polarity of the predominant carriers
   in LnMnPO is controlled by doping. Mn spins in NdMnPO are already in an
   antiferromagnetic ordering state below 350 K, while antiferromagnetic
   ordering of Nd spins occurs at similar to 10 K. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Intensive heat generation associated with surface scattering is a major
   obstacle for minimizing high performance electronic circuit components
   beyond submicron scale, a regime in which the device length scale is
   comparable to the electron inelastic scattering mean free path. In this
   work, the fundamental physics of surface scattering during the
   electrical transport process is addressed by quantum mechanical modeling
   of the current distribution profile in a three-dimensional conduction
   channel. The results show that the surface potentials act as local
   scatters that deflect the current from the topmost surface layer,
   leading to an accumulation of the current density in the subsurface
   layer. The possible size dependency in such a current distribution
   profile is proposed based on the scaling theory in weak localization
   regime. It suggests that for Gaussian-like surface potential profile,
   the inelastic scattering mean free path decreases as the full width half
   maximum of the potential profile increases. Surface scatterings are also
   likely to play an important role in producing the resistivity of
   extremely narrow conducting channels. (C) 2010 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Exemestane (EXE) is an irreversible aromatase inactivator used for the
   treatment of advanced postmenopausal breast cancer. EXE is orally active
   but its bioavailability is about 5\% due to its low solubility in water
   and the extensive first pass effect. It is known that cyclodextrin (CD)
   complexation enhances solubility and oral bioavailability of poorly
   soluble drugs. Thus, it was aimed to design and develop cyclodextrin
   complexes in powder and tablet forms containing EXE to improve aqueous
   solubility and in vitro permeability. In this study, inclusion complexes
   of EXE were prepared with three different CD derivatives
   (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin and
   hydroxypropyl-gamma-cyclodextrin) and by two different preparation
   methods (kneading and colyophilization) and the complexes were
   characterized with H-1 NMR, FT-IR, SEM, X-ray and DSC analyses. Both
   inclusion complexes and tablet formulations prepared using EXE:CD
   inclusion complexes showed significant improvement in the dissolution
   profile of this oral antiestrogen drug. Furthermore, Caco-2 cell
   permeation studies revealed that apparent permeability constant for EXE
   was increased by 3-fold via cyclodextrin complexation. In conclusion,
   complexation of EXE with cyclodextrin derivatives, randomly
   methylated-beta-cyclodextrin in particular, results in a more efficient
   tablet formulation with improved dissolution and better permeation
   suggesting an enhancement in oral bioavailability of the drug. (C) 2010

Pages = {{3405-3409}},

Abstract = {{Variation is an intrinsic feature of biological systems, yet
   developmental biology does not frequently address population-level
   phenomena. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling activity in the vertebrate
   forebrain and face is thought to contribute to continuous variation in
   the morphology of the upper jaw, but despite its potential explanatory
   power, this idea has never been quantitatively assessed. Here, we test
   this hypothesis with an experimental design that is explicitly focused
   on the generation and measurement of variation in multivariate shape,
   tissue growth, cellular behavior and gene expression. We show that the
   majority of upper jaw shape variation can be explained by progressive
   changes in the spatial organization and mitotic activity of midfacial
   growth zones controlled by SHH signaling. In addition, nonlinearity
   between our treatment doses and phenotypic outcomes suggests that
   threshold effects in SHH signaling may play a role in variability in
   midfacial malformations such as holoprosencephaly (HPE). Together, these
   results provide novel insight into the generation of facial morphology,
   and demonstrate the value of quantifying variation for our understanding
   of development and disease.}},

Abstract = {{The microRNA-17-92 cluster is an oncogene in human B cell lymphomas and
   lung cancers. Previous microRNA microarray data revealed that miR-17-5p,
   a member of the miR-17-92 cluster, is upregulated in pancreatic cancer.
   However, the involvement of miR-17-5p expression in pancreatic
   carcinogenesis has not well been studied. In the present study, we
   measured the miR-17-5p expression levels in pancreatic cancer cell
   lines, primary cultures of normal human pancreatic ductal cells,
   formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples derived from 80
   patients who underwent pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer and
   microdissected cells (including normal ductal epithelial, pancreatic
   intraepithelial neoplasia-1B and invasive ductal carcinoma cells) by
   qRT-PCR. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of upregulation of
   miR-17-5p expression on the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic
   cancer cells. We found that pancreatic cancer cells expressed higher
   levels of miR-17-5p than primary cultured normal ductal cells. miR-17-5p
   was also overexpressed in pancreatic cancer in FFPE and microdissected
   samples. Furthermore, analysis of macrodissected FFPE samples revealed
   that high miR-17-5p expression was associated with a poor prognosis (p =
   0.03). In addition, in vitro experiments revealed that SUIT-2 and KP-2
   pancreatic cancer cells transfected with the miR-17-5p precursor showed
   significantly higher cell growth ratios than the corresponding control
   cells (p < 0.001 and p = 0.012, respectively), as well as significantly
   higher numbers of invading cells (p < 0.0001 for both). The present
   findings suggest that miR-17-5p plays important roles in pancreatic
   carcinogenesis and cancer progression, and is associated with a poor
   prognosis in pancreatic cancer.}},

   nanofiltration (NF) membranes were connected in series This system was
   designed to separate the target foulants in the feed water and evaluate
   the fouling potential of a targeted foulant. More specifically,
   particulate, colloids, and organic matters were separated by MF. UF. and
   NF membranes in a consecutive manner, and the modified fouling index
   (MFI) was measured during each separation The resulting three MFI values
   are Particle-MFI Colloid-MFI. and Organic-MFI, and presented
   schematically in a triangle manner The results demonstrated that fouling
   potentials of various feed waters (e g, seawaters pretreated by various
   pretreatment options as well as raw seawater) evaluated by the MMAS were
   much more accurate and informative compared to those predicted by
   conventional silt density index (SDI) and single MFI The fouling
   potentials determined by the MMAS precisely reflected changes in feed
   water quality by different pretreatment options (i e, sand filtration.
   microfiltration, and ultrafiltration), while SDI measurements were not
   sensitive enough to detect these variations It was also shown that the
   fouling potentials evaluated by the MMAS were well correlated with the
   actual flux-decline rates determined by lab-scale RO fouling experiments
   simulating seawater desalination, suggesting that the MMAS could provide
   a better way to predict fouling potential and guidance to select proper
   pretreatment processes (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Many glycoside hydrolases, such as chitinases and cellulases, degrade
   polysaccharides in a processive manner. Inhibition of chitinases is of
   great interest, because chitin-metabolizing pathogenic organisms such as
   certain fungi, insects and nematodes need chitinase activity for
   survival. Here we show how the processivity and the directionality of
   two chitinases, chitinase A (ChiA) and B (ChiB) from Serratia
   marcescens, affects the practical inhibition efficacy (IC50) of
   allosamidin, a general competitive inhibitor of family 18 chitinases.
   The results show that there is a clear negative correlation between
   processivity and the efficiency of competitive inhibition, and that this
   effect of processivity (i.e. reducing inhibitor efficacy) is largest
   when allosamidin binds to those enzyme subsites that interact with the
   polymeric part of the substrate. Besides providing further insight into
   the processivity and directionality of the two Serratia enzymes, these
   results reveal important aspects of ligand binding that should be taken
   into account when designing inhibitors of processive enzymes. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Oxidative ageing as an inevitable process in practical road paving has a
   great effect on the properties of polymer-modified asphalts (PMAs). In
   this article, the effect of short-term and long-term oxidative ageing on
   the theological, physical properties and the morphology of the
   styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS)- and storage-stable SBS/sulfur-modified
   asphalts was studied, respectively. The analysis on the rheological and
   physical properties of the PMAs before and after ageing showed the two
   major effects of ageing. On one hand, ageing prompted the degradation of
   polymer and increased the viscous behaviour of the modified binders, on
   the other, ageing changed the asphalt compositions and improved the
   elastic behaviour of the modified binders. The final performance of the
   aged binders depended on the combined effect. After ageing, the
   storage-stable SBS/sulfur-modified asphalts showed an obvious viscous
   behaviour compare with the SBS-modified asphalts and this led to an
   improved low-temperature creep property. The rutting resistance of the
   SBS-modified asphalts declined by the addition of sulfur due to the
   structural instability of the SBS/sulfur-modified asphalts. The
   rheological properties of the modified binders before and after ageing
   also depended strongly on the structural characteristics of SBS. The
   observation by using optical microscopy showed the compatibility between
   asphalt and SBS was improved with further ageing, especially for the
   storage-stable SBS/sulfur-modified asphalts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Transformations of phosphate (Pi) in different soil fractions were
   tracked using the stable isotopic composition of oxygen in phosphate
   (delta O-18(p)) and Pi concentrations. Clay soil from Israel was treated
   with either reclaimed waste water (secondary, low grade) or with fresh
   water amended with a chemical fertilizer of a known isotopic signature.
   Changes of delta O-18(p) and Pi within different soil fractions, during
   a month of incubation, elucidate biogeochemical processes in the soil,
   revealing the biological and the chemical transformation impacting the
   various P pools. Pin the soil solution is affected primarily by
   enzymatic activity that yields isotopic equilibrium with the water
   molecules in the soil solution. The dissolved P interacts rapidly with
   the loosely bound P (extracted by bicarbonate). The oxides and mineral P
   fractions (extracted by NaOH and HCl, respectively), which are
   considered as relatively stable pools of P. also exhibited isotopic
   alterations in the first two weeks after P application, likely related
   to the activity of microbial populations associated with soil surfaces.
   Specifically, isotopic depletion which could result from organic P
   mineralization was followed by isotopic enrichment which could result
   from preferential biological uptake of depleted P from the mineralized
   pool. Similar transformations were observed in both soils although
   transformations related to biological activity were more pronounced in
   the soil treated with reclaimed waste water compared to the fertilizer
   treated soil. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to provide information about application
   of solid-phase extraction (SPE) for isolation of nine high-intensity
   sweeteners (acesulfame-K. alitame, aspartame, cyclamate, dulcin,
   neotame, saccharin, sucralose and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone) from
   aqueous solutions. The influence of several types of LC-MS compatible
   buffers (different pH values and compositions) on their recovery has
   been studied and discussed. A number of commercially available SPE
   cartridges, such as Chromabond Cl Sec, Strata-X RP, Bakerbond Octadecyl.
   Bakerbond SDB-1, Bakerbond SPE Phenyl, Oasis HLB, LiChrolut RP-18,
   Supelclean LC-18, Discovery DSC-18 and Zorbax C18 were tested in order
   to evaluate their applicability for the isolation of analytes. Very high
   recoveries (better than 92\%) of all studied compounds were obtained
   using formic acid-RN-diisopropylethylamine buffer adjusted to pH 4.5 and
   C-18-bonded silica sorbents. Behaviour of polymeric sorbents strongly
   depends on their structure. Strata-X RP behaves much like a C18-bonded
   silica sorbent. Recoveries obtained using Oasis HLB were comparable with
   those observed for silica-based sorbents. The only compound less
   efficiently (83\%) retained by this sorbent was cyclamate. Bakerbond
   SDB-1 shows unusual selectivity towards aspartame and alitame.
   Recoveries of these two sweeteners were very low (26 and 42\%,
   respectively). It was also found that aspartame and alitame can be
   selectively separated from the mixture of sweeteners using formic
   acid-triethylamine buffer at pH 3.5. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Rapid induction of autoantibodies during ARDS and septic shock}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Little is known about the induction of humoral responses
   directed against human autoantigens during acute inflammation. We
   utilized a highly sensitive antibody profiling technology to study
   autoantibodies in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome
   (ARDS) and severe sepsis, conditions characterized by intensive immune
   activation leading to multiple organ dysfunction.
   Methods: Using Luciferase Immunoprecipitation Systems (LIPS), a cohort
   of control, ARDS and sepsis patients were tested for antibodies to a
   panel of autoantigens. Autoantibody titers greater than the mean plus 3
   SD of the 24 control samples were used to identify seropositive samples.
   Available longitudinal samples from different seropositive ARDS and
   sepsis patient samples, starting from within the first two days after
   admission to the intensive care, were then analyzed for changes in
   autoantibody over time.
   Results: From screening patient plasma, 57\% of ARDS and 46\% of septic
   patients without ARDS demonstrated at least one statistically
   significant elevated autoantibody compared to the controls. Frequent
   high titer antibodies were detected against a spectrum of autoantigens
   including potassium channel regulator, gastric ATPase, glutamic
   decarboxylase-65 and several cytokines. Analysis of serial samples
   revealed that several seropositive patients had low autoantibodies at
   early time points that often rose precipitously and peaked between days
   7-14. Further, the use of therapeutic doses of corticosteroids did not
   diminish the rise in autoantibody titers. In some cases, the patient
   autoantibody titers remained elevated through the last serum sample
   collected.
   Conclusion: The rapid induction of autoantibodies in ARDS and severe
   sepsis suggests that ongoing systemic inflammation and associated tissue
   destruction mediate the break in tolerance against these self proteins.}},

Title = {{Detection and Alignment of 3D Domain Swapping Proteins Using
   Angle-Distance Image-Based Secondary Structural Matching Techniques}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{This work presents a novel detection method for three-dimensional domain
   swapping (DS), a mechanism for forming protein quaternary structures
   that can be visualized as if monomers had ``opened'' their ``closed''
   structures and exchanged the opened portion to form intertwined
   oligomers. Since the first report of DS in the mid 1990s, an increasing
   number of identified cases has led to the postulation that DS might
   occur in a protein with an unconstrained terminus under appropriate
   conditions. DS may play important roles in the molecular evolution and
   functional regulation of proteins and the formation of depositions in
   Alzheimer's and prion diseases. Moreover, it is promising for designing
   auto-assembling biomaterials. Despite the increasing interest in DS,
   related bioinformatics methods are rarely available. Owing to a dramatic
   conformational difference between the monomeric/closed and
   oligomeric/open forms, conventional structural comparison methods are
   inadequate for detecting DS. Hence, there is also a lack of
   comprehensive datasets for studying DS. Based on angle-distance (A-D)
   image transformations of secondary structural elements (SSEs), specific
   patterns within A-D images can be recognized and classified for
   structural similarities. In this work, a matching algorithm to extract
   corresponding SSE pairs from A-D images and a novel DS score have been
   designed and demonstrated to be applicable to the detection of DS
   relationships. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and
   sensitivity of the proposed DS-detecting method were higher than 0.81
   even when the sequence identities of the proteins examined were lower
   than 10\%. On average, the alignment percentage and root-mean-square
   distance (RMSD) computed by the proposed method were 90\% and 1.8
   angstrom for a set of 1,211 DS-related pairs of proteins. The
   performances of structural alignments remain high and stable for
   DS-related homologs with less than 10\% sequence identities. In
   addition, the quality of its hinge loop determination is comparable to
   that of manual inspection. This method has been implemented as a
   web-based tool, which requires two protein structures as the input and
   then the type and/or existence of DS relationships between the input
   structures are determined according to the A-D image-based structural
   alignments and the DS score. The proposed method is expected to trigger
   large-scale studies of this interesting structural phenomenon and
   facilitate related applications.}},

Title = {{Anti-PrPC monoclonal antibody infusion as a novel treatment for
   cognitive deficits in an alzheimer's disease model mouse}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common of the
   conformational neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the
   conversion of a normal biological protein into a beta-sheet-rich
   pathological isoform. In AD the normal soluble A beta (sA beta) forms
   oligomers and fibrils which assemble into neuritic plaques. The most
   toxic form of A beta is thought to be oligomeric. A recent study reveals
   the cellular prion protein, PrPC, to be a receptor for A beta oligomers.
   A beta oligomers suppress LTP signal in murine hippocampal slices but
   activity remains when pretreated with the PrP monoclonal anti-PrP
   antibody, 6D11. We hypothesized that targeting of PrPC to prevent A beta
   oligomer-related cognitive deficits is a potentially novel therapeutic
   approach. APP/PS1 transgenic mice aged 8 months were intraperitoneally
   (i.p.) injected with 1 mg 6D11 for 5 days/week for 2 weeks. Two
   wild-type control groups were given either the same 6D11 injections or
   vehicle solution. Additional groups of APP/PS1 transgenic mice were
   given either i.p. injections of vehicle solution or the same dose of
   mouse IgG over the same period. The mice were then subjected to
   cognitive behavioral testing using a radial arm maze, over a period of
   10 days. At the conclusion of behavioral testing, animals were
   sacrificed and brain tissue was analyzed biochemically or
   immunohistochemically for the levels of amyloid plaques, PrPC,
   synaptophysin, A beta 40/42 and A beta oligomers.
   Results: Behavioral testing showed a marked decrease in errors in 6D11
   treated APP/PS1 Tg mice compared with the non-6D11 treated Tg groups (p
   < 0.0001). 6D11 treated APP/PS1 Tg mice behaved the same as wild-type
   controls indicating a recovery in cognitive learning, even after this
   short term 6D11 treatment. Brain tissue analysis from both treated and
   vehicle treated APP/PS1 groups indicate no significant differences in
   amyloid plaque burden, A beta 40/42, PrPC or A beta oligomer levels.
   6D11 treated APP/PS1 Tg mice had significantly greater synaptophysin
   immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus molecular layer of the hippocampus
   compared to vehicle treated APP/PS1 Tg mice (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Even short term treatment with monoclonal antibodies such
   as 6D11 or other compounds which block the binding of A beta oligomers
   to PrPC can be used to treat cognitive deficits in aged AD transgenic
   mice.}},

Title = {{Data structures and compression algorithms for high-throughput
   sequencing technologies}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies play important
   roles in the life sciences by allowing the rapid parallel sequencing of
   very large numbers of relatively short nucleotide sequences, in
   applications ranging from genome sequencing and resequencing to digital
   microarrays and ChIP-Seq experiments. As experiments scale up, HTS
   technologies create new bioinformatics challenges for the storage and
   sharing of HTS data.
   Results: We develop data structures and compression algorithms for HTS
   data. A processing stage maps short sequences to a reference genome or a
   large table of sequences. Then the integers representing the short
   sequence absolute or relative addresses, their length, and the
   substitutions they may contain are compressed and stored using various
   entropy coding algorithms, including both old and new fixed codes (e. g
   Golomb, Elias Gamma, MOV) and variable codes (e. g. Huffman). The
   general methodology is illustrated and applied to several HTS data sets.
   Results show that the information contained in HTS files can be
   compressed by a factor of 10 or more, depending on the statistical
   properties of the data sets and various other choices and constraints.
   Our algorithms fair well against general purpose compression programs
   such as gzip, bzip2 and 7zip; timing results show that our algorithms
   are consistently faster than the best general purpose compression
   programs.
   Conclusions: It is not likely that exactly one encoding strategy will be
   optimal for all types of HTS data. Different experimental conditions are
   going to generate various data distributions whereby one encoding
   strategy can be more effective than another. We have implemented some of
   our encoding algorithms into the software package GenCompress which is
   available upon request from the authors. With the advent of HTS
   technology and increasingly new experimental protocols for using the
   technology, sequence databases are expected to continue rising in size.
   The methodology we have proposed is general, and these advanced
   compression techniques should allow researchers to manage and share
   their HTS data in a more timely fashion.}},

Abstract = {{The 3p pi D (1)Pi(u) state of the H-2 molecule was reinvestigated with
   different techniques at two synchrotron installations. The Fourier
   transform spectrometer in the vacuum ultraviolet wavelength range of the
   DESIRS beamline at the SOLEIL synchrotron was used for recording
   absorption spectra of the D (1)Pi(u) state at high resolution and high
   absolute accuracy, limited only by the Doppler contribution at 100 K.
   From these measurements, line positions were extracted, in particular,
   for the narrow resonances involving (1)Pi(-)(u) states, with an accuracy
   estimated at 0.06 cm(-1). The new data also closely match multichannel
   quantum defect calculations performed for the Pi(-) components observed
   via the narrow Q-lines. The Lambda-doubling in the D (1)Pi(u) state was
   determined up to v = 17. The 10 m normal incidence scanning
   monochromator at the beamline U125/2 of the BESSY II synchrotron,
   combined with a home-built target chamber and equipped with a variety of
   detectors, was used to unravel information on ionization, dissociation,
   and intramolecular fluorescence decay for the D (1)Pi(u) vibrational
   series. The combined results yield accurate information on the
   characteristic Beutler-Fano profiles associated with the strongly
   predissociated Pi(+)(u) parity components of the D (1)Pi(u) levels.
   Values for the parameters describing the predissociation width as well
   as the Fano-q line shape parameters for the J = 1 and J = 2 rotational
   states were determined for the sequence of vibrational quantum numbers
   up to v = 17. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Peripartum administration of single-dose nevirapine reduces
   mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1
   (HIV-1) but selects for nevirapine-resistant virus.
   METHODS
   In seven African countries, women infected with HIV-1 whose CD4+ T-cell
   counts were below 200 per cubic millimeter and who either had or had not
   taken single-dose nevirapine at least 6 months before enrollment were
   randomly assigned to receive antiretroviral therapy with
   tenofovir-emtricitabine plus nevirapine or tenofovir-emtricitabine plus
   lopinavir boosted by a low dose of ritonavir. The primary end point was
   the time to confirmed virologic failure or death.
   RESULTS
   A total of 241 women who had been exposed to single-dose nevirapine
   began the study treatments (121 received nevirapine and 120 received
   ritonavir-boosted lopin-avir). Significantly more women in the
   nevirapine group reached the primary end point than in the
   ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group (26\% vs. 8\%) (adjusted P = 0.001).
   Virologic failure occurred in 37 (28 in the nevirapine group and 9 in
   the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group), and 5 died without prior
   virologic failure (4 in the nevirapine group and 1 in the
   ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group). The group differences appeared to
   decrease as the interval between single-dose nevirapine exposure and the
   start of antiretroviral therapy increased. Retrospective bulk sequencing
   of baseline plasma samples showed nevirapine resistance in 33 of 239
   women tested (14\%). Among 500 women without prior exposure to
   single-dose nevirapine, 34 of 249 in the nevirapine group (14\%) and 36
   of 251 in the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group (14\%) had virologic
   failure or died.
   CONCLUSIONS
   In women with prior exposure to peripartum single-dose nevirapine (but
   not in those without prior exposure), ritonavir-boosted lopinavir plus
   tenofovir-emtricitabine was superior to nevirapine plus
   tenofovir-emtricitabine for initial antiretroviral therapy.}},

Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Gillespie's direct method is a stochastic simulation algorithm that may
   be used to calculate the steady state solution of a chemically reacting
   system. Recently the all possible states method was introduced as a way
   of accelerating the convergence of the simulations. We demonstrate that
   while the all possible states (APS) method does reduce the number of
   required trajectories, it is actually much slower than the original
   algorithm for most problems. We introduce the elapsed time method, which
   reformulates the process of recording the species populations. The
   resulting algorithm yields the same results as the original method, but
   is more efficient, particularly for large models. In implementing the
   elapsed time method, we present robust methods for recording statistics
   and empirical probability distributions. We demonstrate how to use the
   histogram distance to estimate the error in steady state solutions. (C)

Title = {{4-oxo-N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide: Two Independent Ways to Kill Cancer
   Cells}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: The retinoid 4-oxo-N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide
   (4-oxo-4-HPR) is a polar metabolite of fenretinide (4-HPR) very
   effective in killing cancer cells of different histotypes, able to
   inhibit 4-HPR-resistant cell growth and to act synergistically in
   combination with the parent drug. Unlike 4-HPR and other retinoids,
   4-oxo-4-HPR inhibits tubulin polymerization, leading to multipolar
   spindle formation and mitotic arrest. Here we investigated whether
   4-oxo-4-HPR, like 4-HPR, triggered cell death also via reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) generation and whether its antimicrotubule activity was
   related to a ROS-dependent mechanism in ovarian (A2780), breast (T47D),
   cervical (HeLa) and neuroblastoma (SK-N-BE) cancer cell lines.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We provided evidence that 4-oxo-4-HPR,
   besides acting as an antimicrotubule agent, induced apoptosis through a
   signaling cascade starting from ROS generation and involving endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER) stress response, Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) activation,
   and upregulation of the proapoptotic PLAcental Bone morphogenetic
   protein (PLAB). Through time-course analysis and inhibition of the
   ROS-related signaling pathway (upstream by vitamin C and downstream by
   PLAB silencing), we demonstrated that the antimitotic activity of
   4-oxo-4-HPR was independent from the oxidative stress induced by the
   retinoid. In fact, ROS generation occurred earlier than mitotic arrest
   (within 30 minutes and 2 hours, respectively) and abrogation of the
   ROS-related signaling pathway did not prevent the 4-oxo-4-HPR-induced
   mitotic arrest.
   Conclusions/Significance: These data indicate that 4-oxo-4-HPR
   anticancer activity is due to at least two independent mechanisms and
   provide an explanation of the ability of 4-oxo-4-HPR to be more potent
   than the parent drug and to be effective also in 4-HPR-resistant cell
   lines. In addition, the double mechanism of action could allow
   4-oxo-4-HPR to efficiently target tumour and to eventually counteract
   the development of drug resistance.}},

   with Mutant Pfmdr-1, Not Pfcrt in Madagascar}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Molecular studies have demonstrated that mutations in the Plasmodium
   falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter gene (Pfcrt) play a major
   role in chloroquine resistance, while mutations in P. falciparum
   multidrug resistance gene (Pfmdr-1) act as modulator. In Madagascar, the
   high rate of chloroquine treatment failure (44\%) appears disconnected
   from the overall level of in vitro CQ susceptibility (prevalence of
   CQ-resistant parasites <5\%) or Pfcrt mutant isolates (<1\%), strongly
   contrasting with sub-Saharan African countries. Previous studies showed
   a high frequency of Pfmdr-1 mutant parasites (>60\% of isolates) but did
   not explore their association with P. falciparum chloroquine resistance.
   To document the association of Pfmdr-1 alleles with chloroquine
   resistance in Madagascar, 249 P. falciparum samples collected from
   patients enrolled in a chloroquine in vivo efficacy study were genotyped
   in Pfcrt/Pfmdr-1 genes as well as the estimation of the Pfmdr-1 copy
   number. Except 2 isolates, all samples displayed a wild-type Pfcrt
   allele without Pfmdr-1 amplification. Chloroquine treatment failures
   were significantly associated with Pfmdr-1 86Y mutant codon (OR = 4.6).
   The cumulative incidence of recurrence of patients carrying the Pfmdr-1
   86Y mutation at day 0 (21 days) was shorter than patients carrying
   Pfmdr-1 86N wild type codon (28 days). In an independent set of 90
   selected isolates, in vitro susceptibility to chloroquine was not
   associated with Pfmdr-1 polymorphisms. Analysis of two microsatellites
   flanking Pfmdr-1 allele showed that mutations occurred on multiple
   genetic backgrounds. In Madagascar, Pfmdr-1 polymorphism is associated
   with late chloroquine clinical failures and unrelated with in vitro
   susceptibility or Pfcrt genotype. These results highlight the limits of
   the current in vitro tests routinely used to monitor CQ drug resistance
   in this unique context. Gaining insight about the mechanisms that
   regulate polymorphism in Pfmdr1 remains important, particularly
   regarding the evolution and spread of Pfmdr-1 alleles in P. falciparum
   populations under changing drug pressure which may have important
   consequences in terms of antimalarial use management.}},

Abstract = {{Synaptic gain control and information storage in neural networks are
   mediated by alterations in synaptic transmission, such as in long-term
   potentiation (LTP). Here, we show using both in vitro and in vivo
   recordings from the rat cerebellum that tetanization protocols for the
   induction of LTP at parallel fiber (PF)-to-Purkinje cell synapses can
   also evoke increases in intrinsic excitability. This form of intrinsic
   plasticity shares with LTP a requirement for the activation of protein
   phosphatases 1, 2A, and 2B for induction. Purkinje cell intrinsic
   plasticity resembles CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cell intrinsic plasticity
   in that it requires activity of protein kinaseA (PKA) and case in kinase
   2 (CK2) and is mediated by a downregulation of SK-type calcium-sensitive
   K conductances. In addition, Purkinje cell intrinsic plasticity
   similarly results in enhanced spine calcium signaling. However, there
   are fundamental differences: first, while in the hippocampus increases
   in excitability result in a higher probability for LTP induction,
   intrinsic plasticity in Purkinje cells lowers the probability for
   subsequent LTP induction. Second, intrinsic plasticity raises the
   spontaneous spike frequency of Purkinje cells. The latter effect does
   not impair tonic spike firing in the target neurons of inhibitory
   Purkinje cell projections in the deep cerebellar nuclei, but lowers the
   Purkinje cell signal-to-noise ratio, thus reducing the PF readout. These

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{4, 2}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{A vibrating plate is set into a chaotic state of wave turbulence by a
   forcing having periodic and random components. Both components are
   weighted in order to explore continuously intermediate forcing from the
   periodic to the random one, but keeping constant its rms value. The
   transverse velocity of the plate is measured at the application point of
   the force. It is found that whatever the detail of the forcing is, the
   velocity spectra exhibit a universal cascade for frequencies larger than
   the forcing frequency range. In contrast, the velocity spectra strongly
   depend on the nature of the forcing within the range of forcing
   frequencies. The coherence function is used to extract the contribution
   of the velocity fluctuations that display a linear relationship with the
   forcing. The nonlinear contribution to the velocity fluctuations is
   found to be almost constant, about 55\% of the total velocity
   fluctuations whatever the nature of the forcing from random to periodic.
   On the other hand, the nonlinear contribution to the fluctuations of the
   injected power depends on the nature of the forcing; it is significantly
   larger for the periodic forcing (60\%) and decreases continuously as the
   randomness is increased, reaching a value of 40\% for the pure random
   forcing. For all the cases of intermediate forcing from random to
   periodic, a simple model of the velocity response recovers in a fairly
   good agreement the probability density function of the injected power.
   The consequence of the existence of a linear-response component is
   discussed in the context of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem
   validation in experiments of out-of-equilibrium systems.}},

Title = {{Neural Coding of Movement Direction in the Healthy Human Brain}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Neurophysiological studies in monkeys show that activity of neurons in
   primary cortex (M1), pre-motor cortex (PMC), and cerebellum varies
   systematically with the direction of reaching movements. These neurons
   exhibit preferred direction tuning, where the level of neural activity
   is highest when movements are made in the preferred direction (PD), and
   gets progressively lower as movements are made at increasing degrees of
   offset from the PD. Using a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   adaptation (fMRI-A) paradigm, we show that PD coding does exist in
   regions of the human motor system that are homologous to those observed
   in non-human primates. Consistent with predictions of the PD model, we
   show adaptation (i.e., a lower level) of the blood oxygen level
   dependent (BOLD) time-course signal in M1, PMC, SMA, and cerebellum when
   consecutive wrist movements were made in the same direction (0 degrees
   offset) relative to movements offset by 90 degrees or 180 degrees. The
   BOLD signal in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex adapted equally in all
   movement offset conditions, mitigating against the possibility that the
   present results are the consequence of differential task complexity or
   attention to action in each movement offset condition.}},

Title = {{Refractory obstructive jaundice in a child affected with
   thalassodrepanocytosis: a new endoscopic approach}},
Journal = {{BMC GASTROENTEROLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Liver involvement, including elevated direct-reacting
   bilirubin levels, is common in patients with sickle cell disease. Fifty
   to seventy percent of sickle cell patients have pigmented gallstones due
   to precipitation of unconjugated bilirubin, and cholelithiasis or
   choledocholithiasis are common complications. The highest prevalence of
   these complications occurs in patients with Gilbert's syndrome because
   of the combined effect of increased bilirubin production and reduced
   bilirubin-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme activity.
   Cholelithiasis is also a common complication in patients with
   thalassemia. Endoscopic removal of choledochal stones does not always
   resolve the clinical picture, as in cases of dysfunction of the Vater's
   papilla, increased bile density due to persistently impaired bile flow
   or distortion of the choledocus due to dilatation, or inflammation
   secondary to gallstone.
   Case presentation: We report here a case of severe and persistent
   obstructive jaundice in a child affected with thalassodrepanocytosis and
   Gilbert's syndrome, previously, and unsuccessfully, treated with
   endoscopic removal of choledochal stones. Deep and thorough biliary
   washing, and stenting with a new removable polytetrafluoroethylene
   (PTFE)-covered flared-type stent led to complete resolution of the
   obstructive jaundice.
   Conclusions: This report shows that an aggressive endoscopic approach in
   this select category of patients can help resolve the severe
   complication of hemolytic anemia, thus avoiding surgery.}},

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{41}},
Pages = {{13624-13629}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Working memory has traditionally been viewed as independent of the
   hippocampus and related medial temporal lobe structures. Yet
   memory-impaired patients with medial temporal lobe damage are sometimes
   impaired at remembering relational information (e. g., an object and its
   location) across delays as short as a few seconds. This observation has
   raised the possibility that medial temporal lobe structures are
   sometimes critical for maintaining relational information, regardless of
   whether the task depends on working or long-term memory. An alternative
   possibility is that these structures are critical for maintaining
   relational information only when the task exceeds working memory
   capacity and depends instead on long-term memory. To test these ideas,
   we drew on a method used previously in a classic study of digit span in
   patient HM that distinguished immediate memory from long-term memory. In
   two experiments, we assessed the ability of four patients with medial
   temporal lobe lesions to maintain varying numbers of object-location
   associations across a 1 s retention interval. In both experiments, the
   patients exhibited a similar pattern of performance. They performed
   similarly to controls when only a small number of object-location
   associations needed to be maintained, and they exhibited an abrupt
   discontinuity in performance with larger set sizes. This pattern of
   results supports the idea that maintenance of relational information in
   working memory is intact after damage to the hippocampus and related
   medial temporal lobe structures and that damage to these structures
   impairs performance only when the task depends on long-term memory.}},

   nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons: L-DOPA increases the intracellular
   level of dopamine, but it induces neuron cytotoxicity in a
   concentration-dependent manner. To investigate the molecular signaling
   mechanisms that underlie the concentration-dependent effects of L-DOPA
   on cell viability, the activities of mitogen-activated protein kinases
   (MAPKs) and apoptotic enzymes were measured in rat adrenal
   pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells in the presence of a low concentration (20
   mu M) and high concentrations (100 200 mu M) of L-DOPA. At the low
   concentration, L-DOPA was not cytotoxic and its presence increased the
   activities of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, p38 MAPK,
   BadSer112, BcI-2, and caspase-12. At the high concentrations, L-DOPA was
   cytotoxic and stimulated the activities of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, c-Jun
   N-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2, BadSer155, caspase-12 and caspase-3. The
   increased levels of ERK1/2 and BadSer155 in the presence of high
   concentrations of L-DOPA did not protect against L-DOPA-mediated
   cytotoxicity. In addition, the levels of L-type Ca2+ channel-sensitive
   intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) and Ca2+ were elevated in the presence
   of L-DOPA, and the increase in the levels of intracellular cAMP may also
   play a role in cellular viability, since cAMP levels and cytotoxicity
   increased in parallel with L-DOPA concentrations and the addition of
   forskolin in the medium increased cytotoxicity in a
   concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that, at a low and
   non-toxic concentration, L-DOPA may promote cell survival by increasing
   the activities of ERK1/2, BadSer112 and Bc1-2, while, at high
   concentrations, L-DOPA activates the caspase-3 cell death enzyme through
   the JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways as well as endoplasmic
   reticulum stress that activates caspase-12. Intracellular cAMP levels
   may also play a role here. The results may lead to an effective therapy
   for Parkinson's disease. (C) 2010 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{With an increasing number of vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise
   control (ACC), the impact of such vehicles on the collective dynamics of
   traffic flow becomes relevant. By means of simulation, we investigate
   the influence of variable percentages of ACC vehicles on traffic flow
   characteristics. For simulating the ACC vehicles, we propose a new
   car-following model that also serves as the basis of an ACC
   implementation in real cars. The model is based on the intelligent
   driver model (IDM) and inherits its intuitive behavioural parameters:
   desired velocity, acceleration, comfortable deceleration and desired
   minimum time headway. It eliminates, however, the sometimes unrealistic
   behaviour of the IDM in cut-in situations with ensuing small gaps that
   regularly are caused by lane changes of other vehicles in dense or
   congested traffic. We simulate the influence of different ACC strategies
   on the maximum capacity before breakdown and the (dynamic) bottleneck
   capacity after breakdown. With a suitable strategy, we find
   sensitivities of the order of 0.3, i. e. 1 per cent more ACC vehicles
   will lead to an increase in the capacities by about 0.3 per cent. This
   sensitivity multiplies when considering travel times at actual
   breakdowns.}},

Title = {{The characteristics of dyslipidemia patients with different durations in
   Beijing: a cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{LIPIDS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Background: Prevalence of dyslipidemia is high and increases even in
   younger people. The key aim of this study was to explore the group
   characteristics of patients in different durations of dyslipidemia and
   provide clues for the management of dyslipidemia in Beijing.
   Results: Patients with short duration of dyslipidemia were mainly
   characterized by relatively young age, occupational groups, not eating
   or irregular eating breakfast, less physical activities, having the
   habit of smoking, and 53.8\% is with abnormal LDL-c, 10.4\% is with
   abnormal HDL-c, and 51.5\% is with abnormal TG. 54.6\% of patients with
   longer duration is with abnormal LDL-c, 12.8\% of them is with abnormal
   HDL-c, and 57.1\% is with abnormal TG. They paid much more attentions to
   their health, tried to eat breakfast regularly and do more physical
   activities, gave up smoking, and had regular breakfast, but increasing
   physiological disorders such as elevated blood pressure and glucose
   appeared. Severe sequelaes (stroke, myocardial infarction) were mainly
   observed in patients with the duration of more than 10 years. And in
   this group the proportions of patients with LDL-c >= 4.15 mmol/L and TG
   >= 4.53 mmol/L are the highest among the three groups.
   Conclusions: we should strengthen the tertiary prevention and improve
   the control rate of dyslipidemia in Beijing. Health promotion programs
   such as tobacco control and physical exercise should be carried out for
   younger patients.}},

Title = {{Identification and characterization of the Plasmodium vivax
   thrombospondin-related apical merozoite protein}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax is a major public health
   problem worldwide that affects 70-80 million people in the Middle East,
   Asia, Western Pacific, South America and the Caribbean. Despite its
   epidemiological importance, few antigens from this parasite species have
   been characterized to date compared to Plasmodium falciparum, due in
   part to the difficulties of maintaining an in vitro culture of P. vivax.
   This study describes the identification of the P. falciparum
   thrombospondin-related apical merozoite protein homologue in P. vivax
   (PvTRAMP) and examines its potential to be further evaluated as vaccine
   candidate.
   Methods: The gene encoding PvTRAMP was identified through an extensive
   search of the databases hosting the genome sequence of P. vivax. Genes
   adjacent to pvtramp were identified in silico to determine the degree of
   similarity between the protein sequences encoded by equivalent
   chromosomic fragments in P. falciparum and Plasmodium knowlesi. The
   pvtramp gene was amplified from cDNA of P. vivax schizont stages, cloned
   and expressed in Escherichia coli. Anti-PvTRAMP antisera was obtained by
   inoculating rabbits with PvTRAMP B cell epitopes produced as synthetic
   peptides in order to assess its recognition in parasite lysates by
   Western blot and in intact parasites by indirect immunofluorescence. The
   recognition of recombinant PvTRAMP by sera from P. vivax-infected
   individuals living in endemic areas was also assessed by ELISA.
   Results: The PfTRAMP homologue in P. vivax, here denoted as PvTRAMP, is
   a 340-amino-acid long antigen encoded by a single exon that could have a
   potential role in cytoadherence, as indicated by the presence of a
   thrombospondin structural homology repeat (TSR) domain. According to its
   transcription and expression profile, PvTRAMP is initially located at
   the parasite's apical end and later on the parasite surface. Recombinant
   PvTRAMP is recognized by sera from infected patients, therefore,
   indicating that it is targeted by the immune system during a natural
   infection with P. vivax.
   Conclusions: The results of this work support conducting further studies
   with PvTRAMP to evaluate its immunogenicity and protection-inducing
   ability in the Aotus animal model.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the wide literature describing the biological effects of
   polyphenols, scarce data are available on their content in the human
   diet. This study examined total polyphenols content, free and total
   phenolic acids profile, and antioxidant activity of different commercial
   beers types (abbey, ale, bock, wheat, lager, pilsner, and
   dealcoholized). Ferulic acid is by far the most abundant phenolic acid
   in beers, followed by sinapic, vanillic, caffeic, p-coumaric, and
   4-hydroxyphenylacetic acids. Ferulic, caffeic, syringic, sinapic, and,
   to a lesser extent, vanillic acids are present in beers mainly as bound
   forms, whereas p-coumaric and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acids are generally
   present equally in free and bound forms. Total polyphenols and phenolic
   acids contents greatly vary among different beer types (i.e., total
   polyphenols, from 366 mu g/mL gallic acid equivalents for dealcoholized
   beers to 875 mu g/mL gallic acid equivalents for bock beers, with higher
   values measured in bock, abbey, and ale beers and lower values in
   dealcoholized beers). Similarly, the antioxidant activity measured with
   the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay is remarkably
   different depending on beer type (from 1525 mu M for dealcoholized beers
   to 4663 mu M for bock beers), with higher values in bock, abbey, and ale
   beers and lower values in dealcoholized beers. FRAP values strictly
   correlate with polyphenols and phenolic acids content. The contribution
   of single phenolic acids to the antioxidant activity measured with FRAP
   assay was also studied.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{4, 1}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Using Monte Carlo simulations, we determine the phase diagram of a
   diffusive two-temperature conserved order parameter XY model. When the
   two temperatures are equal the system becomes the equilibrium XY model
   with the continuous Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) vortex-antivortex unbinding
   phase transition. When the two temperatures are unequal the system is
   driven by an energy flow from the higher temperature heat-bath to the
   lower temperature one and reaches a far-from-equilibrium steady state.
   We show that the nonequilibrium phase diagram contains three phases: A
   homogenous disordered phase and two phases with long range, spin texture
   order. Two critical lines, representing continuous phase transitions
   from a homogenous disordered phase to two phases of long range order,
   meet at the equilibrium KT point. The shape of the nonequilibrium
   critical lines as they approach the KT point is described by a crossover
   exponent phi = 2.52 +/- 0.05. Finally, we suggest that the transition
   between the two phases with long-range order is first-order, making the
   KT-point where all three phases meet a bicritical point.}},

Title = {{Elucidation of the 1,3-Sulfanylalcohol Oxidation Mechanism: An Unusual

Abstract = {{A four-step purification method was developed to isolate a citrus
   odorant detected by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O), which was
   apparently specific to Sauternes botrytized wines. A fragmentation
   pattern of the odorant was obtained by multidimensional gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry (MDGC-MS-O). The exact
   mass measurement was used to determine its elemental formula as C6H12OS.
   On the basis of these data, the unusual structure of
   3-propyl-1,2-oxathiolane was synthesized and characterized for the first
   time. This confirmed its identification. Its occurrence in Sauternes
   wine extracts was demonstrated to result from the thermal oxidative
   degradation of 3-sulfanylhexanol disulfide
   (3,3'-disulfanediyldihexan-1-ol) in the GC injector. This disulfide was
   synthesized and then firmly identified for the first time in Sauternes
   wine. Although the presence of 3-sulfanylhexanol oxidation products had
   previously been reported in natural extracts (but not wine), the full
   oxidation pathway from 3-sulfanylhexanol to 3-propyl-gamma-sultine via
   3,3'-disulfanediyldihexan-1-ol was clearly established for the first
   time. Because the disulfide has mainly been detected in Sauternes
   botrytized wines, this finding suggested a singular reactivity of
   3-sulfanylhexanol in botrytized wines, thus opening up a wide range of
   new opportunities in wine chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive anaerobic spore-forming
   bacterium capable of producing four major toxins that are responsible
   for disease symptoms and pathogenesis in a variety of animals, humans,
   and poultry. The organism is the third leading cause of human foodborne
   bacterial disease, and C. perfringens is the presumptive etiologic agent
   of necrotic enteritis among chickens, which in the acute form can cause
   increased mortality among broiler flocks. Countries that have complied
   with the ban on antimicrobial growth promoters (AGP) in feeds have had
   increased incidences of C. perfringens-associated necrotic enteritis in
   poultry. To address this issue, new antimicrobial agents, putative
   lysins from the genomes of bacteriophages, are identified. Two putative
   phage lysin genes (ply) from the clostridial phages phiCP390 and
   phiCP26F were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the
   resultant proteins were purified to near homogeneity. Gene and protein
   sequencing revealed that the predicted and chemically determined amino
   acid sequences of the two recombinant proteins were homologous to
   N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases. The proteins were identical in the
   C-terminal putative cell-wall binding domain, but only 55\% identical to
   each other in the presumptive N-terminal catalytic domain. Both
   recombinant lysins were capable of lysing both parental phage host
   strains of C. perfringens as well as other strains of the bacterium in
   spot and turbidity reduction assays. The observed reduction in turbidity
   was correlated with up to a 3 log cfu/mL reduction in viable C.
   perfringens on brain heart infusion agar plates. However, other member
   species of the clostridia were resistant to the lytic activity by both
   assays.}},

Abstract = {{The anticholinergic agent oxitropium bromide possesses rich crystal
   chemistry, most remarkably exhibiting a strong thermosalient effect
   ({''}jumping crystal{''} effect), a mechanical property with potential
   applications in organic-based actuators. The thermosalient effect,
   manifested in forceful jumps of up to several centimeters, was
   investigated by a combination of structural, microscopic, spectroscopic,
   and thermoanalytical techniques, providing data on which to base a
   proposed mechanism for the phenomenon. Direct observation of the effect
   in a single crystal and structure determination of both phases revealed
   that the jumping of the crystals is a macroscopic manifestation of a
   highly anisotropic change in the cell volume. The cell distortion is
   accompanied by a conformational change of the oxitropium cation, which
   triggers increased separation between the ion pairs in the lattice at
   nearly identical separation between the cation and the anion within each
   ion pair. At the molecular level, the cation acts as a molecular shuttle
   composed of two rigid parts (epoxy-aza-tricyclic-nonyl portion and
   phenyl ring) that are bridged by a flexible ester linkage. The structure
   of the rigid, inert aza-tricyclic portion remains practically unaffected
   by the temperature, suggesting a mechanism in which the large, thermally
   accumulated strain is transferred over the ester bridge to the phenyl
   ring, which rotates to trigger the phase transition. Mechanistic details
   of the higher temperature solid-state phenomena are also presented. The
   high-temperature phase can also be obtained by grinding or UV
   irradiation of the room-temperature phase. In addition, if it is
   irradiated with UV light in the presence of KBr, the high-temperature
   phase undergoes intramolecular photochemical rearrangement. Heating the
   high-temperature phase to slightly below the melting temperature results
   in an additional solid-state reaction that results in the conversion of
   the salt to a mixture of neutral compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The majority of cancer patients will receive radiotherapy (RT),
   therefore, investigations into advances of this modality are important.
   Conventional RI dose intensities are limited by adverse responses in
   normal tissues and a primary goal is to ameliorate adverse normal tissue
   effects. The aim of these experiments is to further our understanding
   regarding the mechanism of radioprotection by the DNA minor groove
   binder, methylproamine, in a cellular context at the DNA level.
   Materials and methods: We used immunocytochemical methods to measure the
   accumulation of phosphorylated H2AX (gamma H2AX) foci following ionizing
   radiation (IR) in patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells exposed to
   methylproamine. Furthermore, we performed pulsed field gel
   electrophoresis DNA damage and repair assays to directly interrogate the
   action of methylproamine on DNA in irradiated cells.
   Results: We found that methylproamine-treated cells had fewer gamma H2AX
   foci after IR compared to untreated cells. Also, the presence of
   methylproamine decreased the amount of lower molecular weight DNA
   entering the gel as shown by the pulsed field gel electrophoresis assay.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that methylproamine acts by
   preventing the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (dsbs) and support
   the hypothesis that radioprotection by methylproamine is mediated, at
   least in part, by decreasing initial DNA damage. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

   Here we report that brief application of nicotine, via alpha 7-nAChRs,

Title = {{Genome-Wide Patterns of Gene Expression during Aging in the African
   Malaria Vector Anopheles gambiae}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{The primary means of reducing malaria transmission is through reduction
   in longevity in days of the adult female stage of the Anopheles vector.
   However, assessing chronological age is limited to crude physiologic
   methods which categorize the females binomially as either very young
   (nulliparous) or not very young (parous). Yet the epidemiologically
   relevant reduction in life span falls within the latter category.
   Age-grading methods that delineate chronological age, using accurate
   molecular surrogates based upon gene expression profiles, will allow
   quantification of the longevity-reducing effects of vector control tools
   aimed at the adult, female mosquito. In this study, microarray analyses
   of gene expression profiles in the African malaria vector Anopheles
   gambiae were conducted during natural senescence of females in
   laboratory conditions. Results showed that detoxification-related and
   stress-responsive genes were up-regulated as mosquitoes aged. A total of
   276 transcripts had age-dependent expression, independently of blood
   feeding and egg laying events. Expression of 112 (40.6\%) of these
   transcripts increased or decreased monotonically with increasing
   chronologic age. Seven candidate genes for practical age assessment were
   tested by quantitative gene amplification in the An. gambiae G3 strain
   in a laboratory experiment and the Mbita strain in field enclosures set
   up in western Kenya under conditions closely resembling natural ones.
   Results were similar between experiments, indicating that senescence is
   marked by changes in gene expression and that chronological age can be
   gauged accurately and repeatedly with this method. These results
   indicate that the method may be suitable for accurate gauging of the age
   in days of field-caught, female An. gambiae.}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to investigate whether a lentil (Morton) extract had
   any protective effect on cardiac hypertrophy, which is one of the most
   significant sequelae of cardiovascular diseases. High phenolic compounds
   (43.4 mg of GAE/g), including thirteen phenolic acid and two flavonoids,
   were detected in the acetone/water/acetic acid lentil extract. The
   extract showed strong antioxidant ability (105 mu mol of TE/g). The
   effect of lentil extract on angiotensin (Ang) II-induced cardiac
   hypertrophy was examined. Results showed that pretreatment with lentil
   extract (25, 50, 100 mu g/mL) significantly attenuated Aug II (0.1 mu
   M)-induced hypertrophy by 18, 28, and 36\% in rat cardiomycytes,
   respectively; lentil extract (12.5, 25, 50 mu g/mL) attenuated Ang 11
   (0.1 mu M)-induced hypertrophy by 9, 17, and 25\% in human
   cardiomycytes, respectively. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   levels were enhanced by Ang II treatment, and this stimulatory action
   was significantly attenuated (33\% inhibition) by lentil extract (100 mu
   g/mL) in rat cardiomyocytes and attenuated by 22\% by 50 mu g/mL lentil
   extract in human cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, Morton lentil extracts
   attenuated Ang II-induced rat and human cardiomyocytes hypertrophy via
   decreasing intracellular ROS levels.}},

   AP-2 Adaptor, A Critical Step in Noncanonical Wnt Signaling}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURE}},

Abstract = {{Wnt association with its receptor, Frizzled (Fz), and recruitment by the
   latter of an adaptor, Dishevelled (Dvl), initiates signaling through at
   least two distinct pathways ({''}canonical{''} and ``noncanonical{''}).
   Endocytosis and compartmentalization help determine the signaling
   outcome. Our previous work has shown that Dvl2 links at least one
   Frizzled family member (Fz4) to clathrin-mediated endocytosis by
   interacting with the mu 2 subunit of the AP-2 clathrin adaptor, through
   both a classical endocytic tyrosine motif and a so-called ``DEP
   domain.{''} We report here the crystal structure of a chimeric protein
   that mimics the Dvl2-mu 2 complex. The DEP domain binds at one end of
   the elongated, C-terminal domain of mu 2. This domain:domain interface
   shows that parts of the mu 2 surface distinct from the tyrosine-motif
   site can help recruit specific receptors or adaptors into a clathrin
   coated pit. Mutation of residues at the DEP-mu 2 contact or in the
   tyrosine motif reduce affinity of Dvl2 for mu 2 and block efficient
   internalization of Fz4 in response to ligation by Wnt5a. The crystal
   structure has thus allowed us to identify the specific interaction that
   leads to Frizzled uptake and to downstream, noncanonical signaling
   events.}},

   appraisal}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{The water conflict in the Upper Klamath Basin typifies the growing
   competition between agricultural and environmental water uses. In 2001,
   drought conditions triggered Endangered Species Act-related requirements
   that curtailed irrigation diversions to the Klamath Reclamation Project,
   costing irrigators tens of millions of dollars. Although this event has
   significantly elevated the perceived risk of future economic catastrophe
   in the basin (and therefore the level of conflict among water users),
   several key changes related to water availability have occurred since
   2001. These changes include reduced ESA requirements and increased
   groundwater pumping capacity, which have lowered the actual risk and
   severity of future water shortages. In this paper, we use a mathematical
   programming model to evaluate how these changes alter the likelihood and
   economic consequences of future shortages. We also consider the effect
   of more flexible transfers among irrigators via water markets. Our
   analysis indicates that future drought conditions like those seen in
   2001 would have more modest economic impacts than in 2001 and that when
   combined with contingent groundwater supplementation and water transfer
   mechanisms such as water markets, both the likelihood and magnitude of
   economic losses among irrigators would be greatly reduced.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the source of errors in ab initio calculations of

   modes, and Grueneisen parameters of bcc Fe and fcc Ni. In nonmagnetic
   metals the main source of error in calculated thermal properties can be
   attributed to evaluation of properties at incorrect lattice constants,
   which in turn may be traced to the choice of exchange and correlation
   functional. However, for magnetic metals the properties may be evaluated
   at both incorrect lattice constant and incorrect magnetic moment. This
   affects vibrational properties so that it is no longer true that

Title = {{The H187R Mutation of the Human Prion Protein Induces Conversion of
   Recombinant Prion Protein to the PrPSc-like Form}},

Abstract = {{Prion diseases are associated with a conformational switch in the prion
   protein (PrP) from its normal cellular form (denoted PrPC) to a
   disease-associated ``scrapie{''} form (PrPSc). A number of PrPSc-like
   conformations can be generated by incubating recombinant PrPC at low pH,
   indicating that protonation of key residues is likely to destabilize
   PrPC, facilitating its conversion to PrPSc. Here, we examine the
   stability of human PrPC with pH and find that PrPC fold stability is
   significantly reduced by the protonation of two histidine residues,
   His187 and His155. Mutation of His187 to an arginine, which imposes a
   permanently positively charged residue in this region of the protein,
   has a dramatic effect on the folding of PrPC, resulting in a molecule
   that displays a markedly increased propensity to oligomerize. The
   oligomeric form is characterized by an increased beta-sheet content,
   loss of fixed side chain interactions, and partial proteinase
   resistance. Hence, the protonation state of H187 appears to be crucial
   in determining the conformation of PrP; the unprotonated form favors
   native PrPC, while the protonated form favors PrPSc-like conformations.
   These results are relevant to the pathogenic H187R mutation found in
   humans, which is associated with an inherited prion disease {[}also
   termed Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome] with unusual
   features such as childhood neuropsychiatric illness. Our data imply that
   the intrinsic instability of the PrPC conformation in this variant is
   caused by a positive charge at this site in the protein. This mutation
   is distinct from all those associated with GSS, which have much more
   subtle physical consequences. The degree of instability might be the
   cause of the unusually early onset of mental disturbance in affected
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{As a consequence of warming temperatures around the world, spring and
   autumn phenologies have been shifting, with corresponding changes in the
   length of the growing season. Our understanding of the spatial and
   interspecific variation of these changes, however, is limited. Not all
   species are responding similarly, and there is significant spatial
   variation in responses even within species. This spatial and
   interspecific variation complicates efforts to predict phenological
   responses to ongoing climate change, but must be incorporated in order
   to build reliable forecasts. Here, we use a long-term dataset
   (1953-2005) of plant phenological events in spring (flowering and leaf
   out) and autumn (leaf colouring and leaf fall) throughout Japan and
   South Korea to build forecasts that account for these sources of
   variability. Specifically, we used hierarchical models to incorporate
   the spatial variability in phenological responses to temperature to then
   forecast species' overall and site-specific responses to global warming.
   We found that for most species, spring phenology is advancing and autumn
   phenology is getting later, with the timing of events changing more
   quickly in autumn compared with the spring. Temporal trends and
   phenological responses to temperature in East Asia contrasted with
   results from comparable studies in Europe, where spring events are
   changing more rapidly than are autumn events. Our results emphasize the
   need to study multiple species at many sites to understand and forecast
   regional changes in phenology.}},

Abstract = {{Expression of herpes simplex virus genes at the initiation of
   replication involves two steps that take place at ND10 nuclear bodies.
   These are suppression of cellular repressors that attempt to silence
   viral DNA and remodeling of the viral chromatin to make it accessible
   for transcription. In earlier studies we reported on the mechanism by
   which viral proteins ICP0 and U(S)3 protein kinase modify and disrupt
   the HDAC1/CoREST/REST/LSD1 repressor complex. The remodeling step
   requires in addition acetylation of histones bound to DNA. In an attempt
   to identify the enzyme, we took note of the observation that ICP0
   physically and functionally interacts with Bmal1, a partner of the CLOCK
   histone acetyl transferase, and key members of the bHLH-PAS family of
   transcriptional factors. The Bmal11 and CLOCK heterodimer is best known
   as a regulator of the circadian oscillation in the mammalian CLOCK
   system. In this article we report the following: (i) in infected cells
   both Bmal1 and CLOCK localize at ND10 bodies; (ii) wild-type virus
   stabilizes the CLOCK protein; (iii) overexpression of CLOCK partially
   compensates for the absence of ICP0 and enables higher yields in cells
   infected with a Delta ICP0 mutant and this activity is not expressed by
   CLOCK mutants lacking histone acetyl transferase activity; and (iv)
   depletion of CLOCK in cells infected with wild-type virus results in
   significant decrease in the expression of all viral proteins tested. We
   conclude that ICP0 interacts with Bmal1 and by extension with CLOCK
   histone acetyl transferase to remodel viral chromatin.}},

Abstract = {{Galectins are unconventionally secreted lectins that participate in the
   formation of glycoprotein lattices that perform a variety of cell
   surface functions. Galectins also bind glycosphingolipid head groups
   with as yet unclear implications for cellular physiology. We report a
   specific interaction between galectin-9 and the Forssman
   glycosphingolipid (FGL) that is important for polarizing Madin-Darby
   canine kidney epithelial cells. Galectin-9 knockdown leads to a severe
   loss of epithelial polarity that can be rescued by addition of the
   recombinant protein. The FGL glycan is identified as the surface
   receptor that cycles galectin-9 to the Golgi apparatus from which the
   protein is recycled back to the apical surface. Together our results
   suggest a model wherein such glycosphingolipid-galectin couples form a
   circuit between the Golgi apparatus and the cell surface that in an
   epithelial context facilitates the apical sorting of proteins and
   lipids.}},

   pain during pregnancy: a qualitative study}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Swedish midwife plays a significant role in the
   antenatal care (ANC) system, and a majority of pregnant women are
   satisfied with their ANC. Pelvic pain during pregnancy (PP) is
   prevalent. The study investigated the views, perceptions and attitudes
   of midwives currently working in ANC regarding PP during pregnancy.
   Methods: The informants were ten midwives between the ages of 35 to 64
   years, with a combined experience of 250 years of midwifery. In-depth
   interviews (n = 4) and one focus group discussion (n = 6) were
   conducted. The data were interpreted using a qualitative content
   analysis design.
   Results: PP was considered a common, clinical problem that had most
   likely increased in prevalence in recent decades and could feature
   prominently in a woman's experience of pregnancy. The informants had
   developed a strategy for supporting pregnant women affected by PP. The
   pregnant woman's fear of not being believed concerning her symptoms and
   the risk of being regarded as a malingerer were acknowledged. Mistrust
   between a midwife and a woman might occur when the patient's symptoms
   were vague and ill defined. PP was not considered as something that
   complicated delivery, and women experiencing it were advised to await
   `the natural course of the pregnancy'.
   Conclusions: PP was considered a common, clinical problem and the
   informants had developed a strategy for supporting pregnant women
   affected by PP. However, the woman's fear of not being believed
   concerning her symptoms of PP was acknowledged and mistrust might occur
   between a midwife and a woman if vague symptoms were reported.}},

Abstract = {{Using a comprehensive ionosphere model, we demonstrate that satellite
   measurements of solar EUV irradiances, neutral densities, and
   temperatures are consistent with Australian ionosonde measurements of
   the electron density from 2002 to 2006. Our approach is to adjust the
   model neutral densities and temperature to determine the changes that
   are needed to reproduce the electron density. These model-derived
   neutral densities and temperatures are found to agree well with
   measurements of neutral density and temperatures from the GUVI
   instrument on the TIMED satellite for both magnetically quiet and
   disturbed conditions. This technique opens up the prospect of using the
   vast ionosonde database to improve temporal variations of empirical
   models of the thermosphere during magnetic storms. It could also help
   validate key global general circulation models of the thermosphere and
   ionosphere. The model calculations also demonstrate the importance of
   vibrationally excited N-2 in the ionosphere. It is particularly
   important in producing negative ionosphere storms and also helps explain
   the rapid recovery after the storms.}},

Abstract = {{Learning through experience underlies the ability to adapt to novel
   tasks and unfamiliar environments. However, learning must be regulated
   so that relevant aspects of the environment are selectively encoded.
   Acetylcholine (ACh) has been suggested to regulate learning by enhancing
   the responses of sensory cortical neurons to behaviorally relevant
   stimuli {[}1]. In this study, we increased synaptic levels of ACh in the
   brains of healthy human subjects with the cholinesterase inhibitor
   donepezil (trade name: Aricept) and measured the effects of this
   cholinergic enhancement on visual perceptual learning. Each subject
   completed two 5 day courses of training on a motion direction
   discrimination task {[}2], once while ingesting 5 mg of donepezil before
   every training session and once while placebo was administered. We found
   that cholinergic enhancement augmented perceptual learning for stimuli
   having the same direction of motion and visual field location used
   during training. In addition, perceptual learning with donepezil was
   more selective to the trained direction of motion and visual field
   location. These results, combined with previous studies demonstrating an
   increase in neuronal selectivity following cholinergic enhancement
   {[}3-5], suggest a possible mechanism by which ACh augments neural
   plasticity by directing activity to populations of neurons that encode
   behaviorally relevant stimulus features.}},

Title = {{Suggestive evidence of associations between liver X receptor beta

Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL GENETICS}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Background: The liver X receptors (LXR) alpha and beta regulate lipid
   and carbohydrate homeostasis and inflammation. Lxr beta(-/-) mice are
   glucose intolerant and at the same time lean. We aimed to assess the
   associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LXR beta
   and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity and related traits
   in 3 separate cohort studies.
   Methods: Twenty LXR beta SNPs were identified by sequencing and
   genotyped in the HUNT2 adult nested case-control study for T2DM (n = 835
   cases/1986 controls). Five tag-SNPs (rs17373080, rs2695121, rs56151148,
   rs2303044 and rs3219281), covering 99.3\% of the entire common genetic
   variability of the LXRb gene were identified and genotyped in the French
   MONICA adult study (n = 2318) and the European adolescent HELENA
   cross-sectional study (n = 1144). In silico and in vitro functionality
   studies were performed.
   Results: We identified suggestive or significant associations between
   rs17373080 and the risk of (i) T2DM in HUNT2 (OR = 0.82, p = 0.03), (ii)
   obesity in MONICA (OR = 1.26, p = 0.05) and (iii) overweight/obesity in
   HELENA (OR = 1.59, p = 0.002). An intron 4 SNP (rs28514894, a perfect
   proxy for rs17373080) could potentially create binding sites for hepatic
   nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4 alpha) and nuclear factor 1 (NF1). The C
   allele of rs28514894 was associated with similar to 1.25-fold higher
   human LXR beta basal promoter activity in vitro. However, no differences
   between alleles in terms of DNA binding and reporter gene
   transactivation by HNF4 alpha or NF1 were observed.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that rs17373080 in LXR beta is
   associated with T2DM and obesity, maybe via altered LXR beta expression.}},

Title = {{MCL-CAw: a refinement of MCL for detecting yeast complexes from weighted
   PPI networks by incorporating core-attachment structure}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: The reconstruction of protein complexes from the physical
   interactome of organisms serves as a building block towards
   understanding the higher level organization of the cell. Over the past
   few years, several independent high-throughput experiments have helped
   to catalogue enormous amount of physical protein interaction data from
   organisms such as yeast. However, these individual datasets show lack of
   correlation with each other and also contain substantial number of false
   positives (noise). Over these years, several affinity scoring schemes
   have also been devised to improve the qualities of these datasets.
   Therefore, the challenge now is to detect meaningful as well as novel
   complexes from protein interaction (PPI) networks derived by combining
   datasets from multiple sources and by making use of these affinity
   scoring schemes. In the attempt towards tackling this challenge, the
   Markov Clustering algorithm (MCL) has proved to be a popular and
   reasonably successful method, mainly due to its scalability, robustness,
   and ability to work on scored (weighted) networks. However, MCL produces
   many noisy clusters, which either do not match known complexes or have
   additional proteins that reduce the accuracies of correctly predicted
   complexes.
   Results: Inspired by recent experimental observations by Gavin and
   colleagues on the modularity structure in yeast complexes and the
   distinctive properties of ``core{''} and ``attachment{''} proteins, we
   develop a core-attachment based refinement method coupled to MCL for
   reconstruction of yeast complexes from scored (weighted) PPI networks.
   We combine physical interactions from two recent ``pull-down{''}
   experiments to generate an unscored PPI network. We then score this
   network using available affinity scoring schemes to generate multiple
   scored PPI networks. The evaluation of our method (called MCL-CAw) on
   these networks shows that: (i) MCL-CAw derives larger number of yeast
   complexes and with better accuracies than MCL, particularly in the
   presence of natural noise; (ii) Affinity scoring can effectively reduce
   the impact of noise on MCL-CAw and thereby improve the quality
   (precision and recall) of its predicted complexes; (iii) MCL-CAw
   responds well to most available scoring schemes. We discuss several
   instances where MCL-CAw was successful in deriving meaningful complexes,
   and where it missed a few proteins or whole complexes due to affinity
   scoring of the networks. We compare MCL-CAw with several recent complex
   detection algorithms on unscored and scored networks, and assess the
   relative performance of the algorithms on these networks. Further, we
   study the impact of augmenting physical datasets with computationally
   inferred interactions for complex detection. Finally, we analyse the
   essentiality of proteins within predicted complexes to understand a
   possible correlation between protein essentiality and their ability to
   form complexes.
   Conclusions: We demonstrate that core-attachment based refinement in
   MCL-CAw improves the predictions of MCL on yeast PPI networks. We show
   that affinity scoring improves the performance of MCL-CAw.}},

Abstract = {{Handed asymmetry in organ shape and positioning is a common feature
   among bilateria, yet little is known about the morphogenetic mechanisms
   underlying left-right (LR) organogenesis. We utilize the directional 360
   degrees clockwise rotation of genitalia in Drosophila to study
   LA-dependent organ looping. Using time-lapse imaging, we show that
   rotation of genitalia by 360 degrees results from an additive process
   involving two ring-shaped domains, each undergoing 180 degrees rotation.
   Our results show that the direction of rotation for each ring is
   autonomous and strictly depends on the LR determinant myosin ID (MyoID).
   Specific inactivation of MyoID in one domain causes rings to rotate in
   opposite directions and thereby cancels out the overall movement. We
   further reveal a specific pattern of apoptosis at the ring boundaries
   and show that local cell death is required for the movement of each
   domain, acting as a brake-releaser. These data indicate that organ
   looping can proceed through an incremental mechanism coupling LR
   determination and apoptosis. Furthermore, they suggest a model for the
   stepwise evolution of genitalia posture in Diptera, through the
   emergence and duplication of a 180 degrees LR module.}},

Abstract = {{Amyloid-beta (A beta) plaque deposition can precede the clinical
   manifestations of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) by many years and
   can be associated with changes in brain metabolism. Both the A beta
   plaque deposition and the changes in metabolism appear to be
   concentrated in the brain's default-mode network. In contrast to prior
   studies of brain metabolism which viewed brain metabolism from a unitary
   perspective that equated glucose utilization with oxygen consumption, we
   here report on regional glucose use apart from that entering oxidative
   phosphorylation (so-called ``aerobic glycolysis{''}). Using PET, we
   found that the spatial distribution of aerobic glycolysis in normal
   young adults correlates spatially with A beta deposition in individuals
   with DAT and cognitively normal participants with elevated A beta,
   suggesting a possible link between regional aerobic glycolysis in young
   adulthood and later development of Alzheimer pathology.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Graphene properties can be manipulated by a periodic potential. Based on
   the tight-binding model, we study graphene under a one-dimensional
   modulated magnetic field which contains both a uniform and a staggered
   component. The chiral current-carrying edge states generated at the
   interfaces where the staggered component changes direction, lead to an
   unusual integer quantum Hall effect in graphene, which can be observed
   experimentally by a standard four-terminal Hall measurement. When Zeeman
   splitting is taken into account, an anomalous state is predicted where
   the electron edge currents with opposite spin polarization propagate in
   the opposite directions at one sample boundary, whereas propagate in the
   same directions at the other sample boundary. Furthermore, all the
   interface edge currents are fully spin polarized with the same spin
   direction, which is expected to have potential application in spintronic
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{Cinnamoyl CoA reductases (CCR) convert hydroxycinnamoyl CoA esters to
   their corresponding cinnamyl aldehydes in monolignol biosynthesis. We
   identified two CCR genes in the model legume Medicago truncatula. CCR1
   exhibits preference for feruloyl CoA, but CCR2 prefers caffeoyl and
   4-coumaroyl CoAs, exhibits sigmoidal kinetics with these substrates, and
   is substrate-inhibited by feruloyl and sinapoyl CoAs. M. truncatula
   lines harboring transposon insertions in CCR1 exhibit drastically
   reduced growth and lignin content, whereas CCR2 knockouts grow normally
   with moderate reduction in lignin levels. CCR1 fully and CCR2 partially
   complement the irregular xylem gene 4 CCR mutation of Arabidopsis. The
   expression of caffeoyl CoA 3-O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) is
   up-regulated in CCR2 knockout lines; conversely, knockout of CCoAOMT
   up-regulates CCR2. These observations suggest that CCR2 is involved in a
   route to monolignols in Medicago whereby coniferaldehyde is formed via
   caffeyl aldehyde which then is 3-O-methylated by caffeic acid
   O-methyltransferase.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the unique nulling properties of PSR B0818-41, using the
   Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 325 and 610 MHz. This pulsar
   shows well-defined nulls, with lengths ranging from a few tens of pulses
   to a few hundreds of pulses. We estimate a nulling fraction of about 30
   per cent at 325 MHz. Furthermore, we find the following interesting
   behaviour of the pulse intensities, pulse shapes, pulse widths and the
   drift rate, just before and after the nulls. (i) There is a clear
   difference between the transitions from bursts to nulls to that from the
   nulls to bursts. The pulsar's intensity does not switch off abruptly at
   the null, but fades gradually, taking similar to 10P(1). On the other
   hand, just after the nulls the intensity rises to a maximum over a short
   (less than one period) time-scale. (ii) While the last active pulses
   before nulls are dimmer, the first few active pulses just after the
   nulls outshine the normal ones. This effect is very clear for the inner
   region of the pulsar profile, where the mean intensity of the last few
   active pulses just after the nulls is similar to 2.8 times more than
   that for the last active pulses just before the nulls. (iii) There is a
   significant evolution of the shape of the pulsar's profile, around the
   nulls, especially at the beginning of the bursts: an enhanced bump of
   intensity in the inner region, a change in the ratio of the strengths of
   the leading and trailing peaks towards a more symmetric profile, an
   increase in profile width of about 10 per cent and a shift of the
   profile centre towards later longitudes. Some of these can be explained
   by a (temporary?) shift of the emission regions to different heights
   and/or slightly outer field lines in the magnetosphere. (iv) Just before
   the onset of the nulls, for about 60 per cent of the occasions, the
   apparent drift rate becomes slower (correlated with the gradual decrease
   of pulse intensity), transitioning to an almost phase stationary drift
   pattern. Further, when the pulsar comes out of the null, the increased
   intensity is very often accompanied by what looks like a disturbed drift
   rate behaviour, which settles down to the regular drift pattern as the
   pulsar intensity returns to normal. Thus, we find some very specific and
   well-correlated changes in the radio emission properties of PSR B0818-41
   when the emission restarts after a null. These could imply that the
   phenomenon of nulling is associated with some kind of a `reset' of the
   pulsar radio emission engine. We also present plausible explanations for
   some of the observed behaviour, using the Partially Screened Gap model
   of the inner pulsar accelerator.}},

   micro-electromechanical system integrated on low loss suspended feeding
   nanowire waveguide, achieved relatively large resonance spectral shifts
   of up to 18 nm at a driving voltage of 25 V. Such designs may

Title = {{Limits on the molecular gas content of z similar to 5 LBGs}},

Abstract = {{We present limits on the molecular gas content of Lyman break galaxies
   (LBGs) at z similar to 5 from observations targeting redshifted CO(1-0)
   and CO(2-1) line emission. We observed a single field containing eight
   spectroscopically confirmed z similar to 5 LBGs, seven of which are
   contained within a narrow (z = 4.95 +/- 0.08) redshift range and the
   eighth is at z = 5.2. No source was individually detected. Assuming the
   CO to H-2 conversion factor for vigorous starbursts, we place upper
   limits on the molecular gas content of individual z similar to 5 LBGs of
   M(H-2) less than or similar to 10(10) M-circle dot. From a stacking
   analysis combining all of the non-detections, the typical z similar to 5
   LBG has an H-2 mass limit comparable to their stellar mass, <3.1 x 10(9)
   M-circle dot. This limit implies that, given the star formation rates of
   these systems (measured from their UV emission), star formation could be
   sustained for at most similar to 100 Myr, similar to the typical ages of
   their stellar populations. The lack of a substantially larger reservoir
   of cold gas argues against the LBGs being UV-luminous superstarbursts
   embedded in much larger UV-dark systems and as a result increases the
   likelihood that at least those LBGs with multiple components are
   starbursts triggered by mergers. The sources responsible for
   re-ionization are expected to be starbursts similar to these systems,
   but with lower luminosities, masses and consequently with star formation
   time-scales far shorter than the recombination time-scale. If so, the
   ionized bubbles expected in the IGM during the re-ionization era will
   only infrequently have UV-luminous sources at their centres.}},

Title = {{Cost effectiveness of OptiMal (R) rapid diagnostic test for malaria in
   remote areas of the Amazon Region, Brazil}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: In areas with limited structure in place for microscopy
   diagnosis, rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) have been demonstrated to be
   effective.
   Method: The cost-effectiveness of the Optimal (R) and thick smear
   microscopy was estimated and compared. Data were collected on remote
   areas of 12 municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon. Data sources
   included the National Malaria Control Programme of the Ministry of
   Health, the National Healthcare System reimbursement table,
   hospitalization records, primary data collected from the municipalities,
   and scientific literature. The perspective was that of the Brazilian
   public health system, the analytical horizon was from the start of fever
   until the diagnostic results provided to patient and the temporal
   reference was that of year 2006. The results were expressed in costs per
   adequately diagnosed cases in 2006 U. S. dollars. Sensitivity analysis
   was performed considering key model parameters.
   Results: In the case base scenario, considering 92\% and 95\%
   sensitivity for thick smear microscopy to Plasmodium falciparum and
   Plasmodium vivax, respectively, and 100\% specificity for both species,
   thick smear microscopy is more costly and more effective, with an
   incremental cost estimated at US\$ 549.9 per adequately diagnosed case.
   In sensitivity analysis, when sensitivity and specificity of microscopy
   for P. vivax were 0.90 and 0.98, respectively, and when its sensitivity
   for P. falciparum was 0.83, the RDT was more cost-effective than
   microscopy.
   Conclusion: Microscopy is more cost-effective than OptiMal (R) in these
   remote areas if high accuracy of microscopy is maintained in the field.
   Decision regarding use of rapid tests for diagnosis of malaria in these
   areas depends on current microscopy accuracy in the field.}},

Title = {{A genome-wide SNP-association study confirms a sequence variant
   (g.66493737C > T) in the equine myostatin (MSTN) gene as the most
   powerful predictor of optimum racing distance for Thoroughbred
   racehorses}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Background: Thoroughbred horses have been selected for traits
   contributing to speed and stamina for centuries. It is widely recognized
   that inherited variation in physical and physiological characteristics
   is responsible for variation in individual aptitude for race distance,
   and that muscle phenotypes in particular are important.
   Results: A genome-wide SNP-association study for optimum racing distance
   was performed using the EquineSNP50 Bead Chip genotyping array in a
   cohort of n = 118 elite Thoroughbred racehorses divergent for race
   distance aptitude. In a cohort-based association test we evaluated
   genotypic variation at 40,977 SNPs between horses suited to short
   distance (<= 8 f) and middle-long distance (>8 f) races. The most
   significant SNP was located on chromosome 18: BIEC2-417495 similar to
   690 kb from the gene encoding myostatin (MSTN) {[}P(unadj.) = 6.96 x
   10(-6)]. Considering best race distance as a quantitative phenotype, a
   peak of association on chromosome 18 (chr18: 65809482-67545806)
   comprising eight SNPs encompassing a 1.7 Mb region was observed. Again,
   similar to the cohort-based analysis, the most significant SNP was
   BIEC2-417495 (P(unadj.) = 1.61 x 10(-9); P(Bonf.) = 6.58 x 10(-5)). In a
   candidate gene study we have previously reported a SNP (g.66493737C> T)
   in MSTN associated with best race distance in Thoroughbreds; however,
   its functional and genome-wide relevance were uncertain. Additional
   re-sequencing in the flanking regions of the MSTN gene revealed four
   novel 3' UTR SNPs and a 227 bp SINE insertion polymorphism in the 5' UTR
   promoter sequence. Linkage disequilibrium was highest between
   g.66493737C> T and BIEC2-417495 (r(2) = 0.86).
   Conclusions: Comparative association tests consistently demonstrated the
   g.66493737C>T SNP as the superior variant in the prediction of distance
   aptitude in racehorses (g.66493737C> T, P = 1.02 x 10(-10);
   BIEC2-417495, P(unadj.) = 1.61 x 10(-9)). Functional investigations will
   be required to determine whether this polymorphism affects putative
   transcription-factor binding and gives rise to variation in gene and
   protein expression. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates that the
   g.66493737C>T SNP provides the most powerful genetic marker for
   prediction of race distance aptitude in Thoroughbreds.}},

Abstract = {{The optical polarization properties of a-plane AlxGa1-xN films have been
   investigated by polarization-dependent photoluminescence (PL). The
   degree of polarization decreased with increasing the Al composition, and
   the main optical polarization direction switched from epsilon

   band switching, representing that the optical transition energy of
   epsilon // c is surpassing that of epsilon perpendicular to c. However,
   with the Al composition larger than x = 0.1, the higher energy optical
   transitions of epsilon // c exhibited the stronger PL intensity,
   opposite to the normal situations that higher energy states commonly
   have weaker PL intensity than the lower energy states. We utilized the 6
   x 6 k.p model and the lambertian-like radiation pattern assumption to
   explain this abnormal optical polarization switching behavior in the

Abstract = {{The synthesis and characterization of trianionic {[}(BuOCO)-Bu-t](3-)
   pincer-supported tungsten alkylidene and alkylidyne complexes are
   described. The reaction of an equimolar ratio of ((BuO)-Bu-t)(3)W 
   CC(CH3)(3) (where (BuO)-Bu-t = tert-butoxide) with {[}(BuOCO)-Bu-t]H-3
   (9) and 2,6-diisopropylphenol affords the alkylidene
   {[}(BuOCO)-Bu-t]W=CHC(CH3)(3)(O-2,6-C6H(3)-Pr-i(2)) (10), with a
   five-coordinate tungsten center that adopts a distorted square-pyramidal
   geometry. Treatment of (Np)(3)W  CC(CH3)(3) (11) with 9 provides an
   equilibrium mixture of the two isomeric alkylidenes with the general
   formula
   {[}((BuOCO)-Bu-t)W=CHC(CH3)(3)(mu-BuOCHO)W=CHC(CH3)(3)((BuOCO)-Bu-t)]
   (12(kin) and 12(therm)). Single crystals of the two isomers
   cocrystallize and were amenable to X-ray diffraction studies, which
   revealed subtle differences in their molecular structures, most notably
   the orientation of the bridging ligand. The complexes are each comprised
   of two square-pyramidal tungsten ions linked by the diphenolate form of
   the OCO ligand. Isomer 12(kin) could not be isolated independently;
   however, adding PMe2Ph to the metalation between 11 and 9 provided
   12(therm) exclusively, thus enabling a full set of characterization
   techniques including 2-D NMR spectroscopy. Salt metathesis between
   {[}(BuOCHO)-Bu-t]K-2(THF)2 (15) and (DME)Cl3W  CC(CH3)(3) (16) in
   diethyl ether produces the alkylidyne ((BuOCHO)-Bu-t)W  CC(CH3)(3)Cl
   (17) as the major product along with 12(kin) and other unidentified
   decomposition products. As a consequence, characterization of 17 was
   limited to H-1 NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.}},

Abstract = {{A series of products of {[}3+2] cycloaddition reactions of molybdenum
   azide complexes with nitriles and an alkyne were prepared and
   characterized. These include the tetrazolate complexes
   Mo(eta(3)-C3H5)(CO)(2)(en)(N4CR) (R = CH3 (1), C6H5 (2), C(CH3)(3) (3),
   CH-CHCN (4)) and the triazolate complexes
   Mo(eta(3)-C3H5)(CO)(2)(L-2)\{N3C2(CO2CH3)(2)\} (L-2 = en (6), dppe (7)).
   They are the first examples of a complex with a heterocyclic ligand
   prepared via a reaction of a group VIB metal azide with an unsaturated
   dipolarophile. All these complexes are fluxional in solution, with those
   containing en ligands displaying broad unresolved proton NMR signals at
   room temperature. With the exception of 1, their solution behavior was
   studied by low-temperature NMR spectroscopy. In contrast, the dppe
   complexes display average NMR signals at room temperature due to a fast
   exchange. The solid-state structures of these cycloaddition products
   were also determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The
   tetrazolate complexes 1, 2, and 4 adopt an asymmetric endo-conformation,
   while complex 3 adopts a symmetric endo-conformation. The tetrazolate
   ligand is N(1)-bonded in 1 and N(2)-bonded in complexes 2-4. The steric
   effect is the main reason for the N(2)-bonding mode found in 3. Complex
   4 is the first structurally characterized product of a {[}3+2]
   cycloaddition reaction involving the C=N bond of fumaronitrile. The
   triazolate complexes 6 and 7 adopt an asymmetric endo-conformation, with
   their heterocyclic ligands being bonded to the metal via N(2).}},

Title = {{Utility of waist-to-height ratio in assessing the status of central
   obesity and related cardiometabolic risk profile among normal weight and
   overweight/obese children: The Bogalusa Heart Study}},
Journal = {{BMC PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Body Mass Index (BMI) is widely used to assess the impact of
   obesity on cardiometabolic risk in children but it does not always
   relate to central obesity and varies with growth and maturation.
   Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) is a relatively constant anthropometric
   index of abdominal obesity across different age, sex or racial groups.
   However, information is scant on the utility of WHtR in assessing the
   status of abdominal obesity and related cardiometabolic risk profile
   among normal weight and overweight/obese children, categorized according
   to the accepted BMI threshold values.
   Methods: Cross-sectional cardiometabolic risk factor variables on 3091
   black and white children (56\% white, 50\% male), 4-18 years of age were
   used. Based on the age-, race- and sex-specific percentiles of BMI, the
   children were classified as normal weight (5th - 85th percentiles) and
   overweight/obese (>= 85th percentile). The risk profiles of each group
   based on the WHtR (<0.5, no central obesity versus >= 0.5, central
   obesity) were compared.
   Results: 9.2\% of the children in the normal weight group were centrally
   obese (WHtR >= 0.5) and 19.8\% among the overweight/obese were not (WHtR
   < 0.5). On multivariate analysis the normal weight centrally obese
   children were 1.66, 2.01, 1.47 and 2.05 times more likely to have
   significant adverse levels of LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,
   triglycerides and insulin, respectively. In addition to having a higher
   prevalence of parental history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the normal
   weight central obesity group showed a significantly higher prevalence of
   metabolic syndrome (p < 0.0001). In the overweight/obese group, those
   without central obesity were 0.53 and 0.27 times less likely to have
   significant adverse levels of HDL cholesterol and HOMA-IR, respectively
   (p < 0.05), as compared to those with central obesity. These
   overweight/obese children without central obesity also showed
   significantly lower prevalence of parental history of hypertension (p =
   0.002), type 2 diabetes mellitus (p = 0.03) and metabolic syndrome (p <
   0.0001).
   Conclusion: WHtR not only detects central obesity and related adverse
   cardiometabolic risk among normal weight children, but also identifies
   those without such conditions among the overweight/obese children, which
   has implications for pediatric primary care practice.}},

Abstract = {{Mammals navigate a complex environment using a variety of strategies,
   which can operate in parallel and even compete with one another. We have
   recently described a variant water maze task in which two of these
   strategies, hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and
   striatum-dependent cued learning, can be dissociated. Male rodents
   perform better at some spatial learning tasks, while female rodents more
   readily learn certain striatum-dependent behavioral strategies. We
   therefore predicted that sex would differentially influence spatial and
   cued learning in the water maze. We trained adult male and female
   C5781/6 mice for 7 days in the two-cue variant of the water maze, with
   probe trials on days 5 and 7. In two independent experiments, males and
   females performed similarly, with both groups showing good spatial
   learning after 5 and 7 days of training, and both groups showing
   trend-level cued learning after 5 days and robust learning after 7.
   Therefore, contrary to our hypothesis, sex does not significantly affect
   cued or spatial learning in this task. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {{Many of the early-type galaxies (ETGs) observed so far at z > 1 turned
   out to have smaller radii with respect to that of a typical present day
   ETG with comparable mass. This has generated the conviction that in the
   past ETGs were more compact, hence denser, and that as a consequence,
   they should have increased their radius across the time to reconcile
   with the present day ones. However, observations have not yet
   established whether the population of early types in the early universe
   was fully represented by compact galaxies nor if they were so much more
   numerous than in the present day Universe to require an evolution of
   their sizes. Here we report the results of a study based on a complete
   sample of 34 ETGs at 0.9 < z(spec) < 1.92. We find a majority (62 per
   cent) of normal ETGs, similar to typical local ones, co-existing with
   compact early types from similar to two to similar to six times smaller
   in spite of the same mass and redshift. The co-existence of normal and
   compact ETGs at < z > similar or equal to 1.5 suggests that their
   build-up taken place in the first 3-4 Gyr, followed distinct paths.
   Furthermore, we find that the number density of compact early types at <
   z > similar or equal to 1.5 is consistent with the lower limits of the
   local number density of compact early types derived from local clusters
   of galaxies. The similar number of compact early types found in the
   early and in the present day Universe frustrates the hypothesized
   effective radius evolution while provides evidence that also compact
   ETGs were as we see them today 9-10 Gyr ago. Finally, the fact that (at
   least) most of the compact ETGs at high z are accounted for by compact
   early types in local cluster of galaxies implies that the former are the
   direct progenitors of the compact early-type cluster galaxies
   establishing a direct link between environment and early phases of
   assembly of ETGs.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous photometric observations of the visible component of the
   single-line, K2IV spectroscopic binary II Peg carried out by the MOST
   satellite during 31 consecutive days in 2008 have been analysed. On top
   of spot-induced brightness modulation, 11 flares were detected of three
   distinct types characterized by different values of rise, decay and
   duration times. The flares showed a preference for occurrence at
   rotation phases when the most spotted hemisphere is directed to the
   observer, confirming previous similar reports. An attempt to detect a
   grazing primary minimum caused by the secondary component transiting in
   front of the visible star gave a negative result. The brightness
   variability caused by spots has been interpreted within a cold spot
   model. An assumption of differential rotation of the primary component
   gave a better fit to the light curve than a solid-body rotation model.}},

Abstract = {{Precision power measurements of terahertz (THz) radiation are required
   to establish metrological applications in the THz spectral range.
   However, traceability to the International System of Units (SI) has been
   missing in the THz region in the past. The Physikalisch-Technische
   Bundesanstalt (PTB), as the national metrology institute of Germany,
   determines the spectral responsivity of detectors for THz radiation by
   using two complementary optical methods: source- and detector-based
   radiometry. Both approaches have been successfully prototyped, and a
   pyroelectric THz detector with a well-defined aperture is used to verify
   the consistency of the two independent calibration methods. These
   primary investigations led to the design of a new measurement facility
   for the determination of THz radiant power and the responsivity
   calibration of THz detectors traceable to the SI. (C) 2010 Optical

Abstract = {{The hydrothermal stability of two alternative catalysts for the
   production of hydrocarbons from crude bio-oil has been studied. The
   valorisation of crude bio-oil from lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis has
   been studied by means of a two-step process (thermal-catalytic) and
   co-feeding methanol, which are strategies that attenuate both the
   deposition of pyrolytic lignin and catalyst deactivation by coke
   deposition. A catalyst prepared based on a HZSM-5 zeolite with a
   SiO(2)/Al(2)O(3) ratio of 80 produces a C(2)-C(4) olefins yield of 32
   wt\% at 500 degrees C and with a space time of 0.371 (g of catalyst) h
   (g of oxygenates)(-1). The modification of a HZSM-5 zeolite
   (SiO(2)/Al(2)O(3) ratio of 30) by impregnation with 1 wt\% of Ni
   produces a yield of aromatics of 42 wt\% for the same temperature and
   space time. These catalysts are very active for bio-oil valorisation
   (conversion above 90\%) with high hydrothermal stability, given that
   their kinetic behaviour is similar throughout 10 successive
   reaction-regeneration cycles carried out under severe operating
   conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A common model invoked to describe the X-ray spectra of active galaxies
   includes a relativistically blurred reflection component, which in some
   cases can be the dominant contributor to the received flux. Alternative
   interpretations are often based around complex absorption, and to date
   it has proven difficult to determine between these two viable models.
   Recent works on Suzaku observations of the active nuclei in NGC 1365, 1H
   0419-577 and PDS 456 have found the presence of strong X-ray emission at
   high (similar to 10-50 keV) energies, referred to as `hard excesses',
   and it has been claimed that this emission cannot be explained with
   simple disc reflection models. Here we investigate the high-energy
   emission in these sources by constructing disc reflection models and
   show that they can successfully reproduce the observed spectra. In
   addition, we find the behaviour of NGC 1365, 1H 0419-577 in these
   observations to be broadly consistent with previous work on disc
   reflection interpretations.}},

   has been recently observed at TeV and GeV energies. Here we investigate
   the hard X-ray spectral and timing properties of this source using the

   systematic analysis based on all available INTEGRAL data since 2002
   December 28 up to 2008 April 30. The total exposure time analysed
   amounts to 2.1 Ms, hence more than double the previous reported sample.
   The source is best detected in the 18-60 keV band, with a significance
   level of 12.0 sigma. The hard X-ray data are best fitted with a simple
   power law with a photon index of similar to 1.7 +/- 0.2. We detect a
   periodical signal at 27 +/- 4 d, matching the orbital period of 26.496 d
   previously reported at other wavelengths. The hard X-ray orbital light

Abstract = {{Research on the temporal characteristics of visual processing, as
   measured with critical flicker fusion or the latency of visual evoked
   potential (VEP), shows controversial results if different eccentricities
   of visual stimuli are compared. To clarify this question, a direct
   measure of cortical activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) was
   applied to examine the neuronal summation latency and peak latency for
   both near and far peripheral stimuli. Consistent with cortical
   magnification, the peak amplitude for less eccentric stimuli was larger
   than that for more eccentric stimuli. More importantly, the current data
   also demonstrated longer cortical summation latency and peak latency for
   more eccentric visual stimuli, but only the summation latency difference
   between near and far stimuli correlated with the peak amplitude
   difference between near and far stimuli. These results suggest
   dissociable mechanisms of summation latency and peak latency with
   respect to their contributions to the stimulus eccentricity effect, and
   provide potential explanations for controversial results in previous
   studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A profile of prognostic and molecular factors in European and Maori
   breast cancer patients}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: New Zealand Maori have a poorer outcome from breast cancer
   than non-Maori, yet prognostic data are sparse. The objective of this
   study was to quantify levels of prognostic factors in a cohort of
   self-declared Maori and European breast cancer patients from
   Christchurch, New Zealand.
   Methods and Results: Clinicopathological and survival data from 337
   consecutive breast cancer patients (27 Maori, 310 European) were
   evaluated. Fewer tumours were high grade in Maori women than European
   women (p = 0.027). No significant ethnic differences were detected for
   node status, tumour type, tumour size, human epidermal growth factor
   receptor, oestrogen and progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status, or
   survival.
   In addition, tumour and serum samples from a sub-cohort of 14 Maori
   matched to 14 NZ European patients were analyzed by immunohistochemistry
   and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for molecular prognostic factors.
   Significant correlations were detected between increased grade and
   increased levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF 1 alpha), glucose
   transporter 1 (GLUT 1), microvessel density (MVD) and cytokeratins CK5/6
   (p < 0.05). High nodal status correlated with reduced carbonic anhydrase
   IX (CA-IX). Negative ER/PR status correlated with increased GLUT-1,
   CA-IX and MVD. Within the molecular factors, increased HIF-1 alpha
   correlated with raised GLUT-1, MVD and CK5/6, and CK5/6 with GLUT-1 and
   MVD (p < 0.05). The small number of patients in this sub-cohort limited
   discrimination of ethnic differences.
   Conclusions: In this Christchurch cohort of breast cancer patients,
   Maori women were no more likely than European women to have pathological
   or molecular factors predictive of poor prognosis. These data contrast
   with data from the North Island NZ, and suggest potential regional
   differences.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{543-549}},

Abstract = {{The statistical distribution of energies among particles responsible for
   long gamma-ray burst (GRB) emission is analyzed in light of recent
   results of the Fermi Observatory. The all-sky flux, F., recorded by the
   Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) is shown, despite its larger energy range,
   to be not significantly larger than that reported by the Burst and
   Transient Explorer, suggesting a relatively small flux in the 3-30MeV
   energy range. The present-day energy input rate in gamma-rays recorded
   by the GBM from long GRBs is found, assuming star formation rates in the
   literature, to be W(0) = 0.5F gamma H/c = 5x10(42) erg Mpc(-3) yr(-1).
   The Large Area Telescope fluence, when observed, is about 5\%-10\% per
   decade of the total, in good agreement with the predictions of
   saturated, nonlinear shock acceleration. The high-energy component of
   long GRBs, as measured by Fermi, is found to contain only similar to
   10-2.5 of the energy needed to produce ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays
   (UHECRs) above 4 EeV, assuming the latter to be extragalactic, when
   various numerical factors are carefully included, if the cosmic-ray
   source spectrum has a spectral index of -2. The observed. -ray fraction
   of the required UHECR energy is even smaller if the source spectrum is
   softer than E-2. The AMANDA II limits rule out such a GRB origin for
   UHECRs if much more than 10(-2) of the cosmic-ray energy goes into
   neutrinos that are within, and simultaneous with, the gamma-ray beam. It
   is suggested that ``orphan{''} neutrinos out of the gamma-ray beam might
   be identifiable via orphan afterglow or other wide angle signatures of
   GRBs in lieu of coincidence with prompt gamma-rays, and it is
   recommended that feasible single neutrino trigger criteria be
   established to search for such coincidences.}},

Abstract = {{Hypericum perforatum is a traditional medicinal plant with wound healing
   and antidepressant properties. Efficiency of micropropagation is often
   related to the long term maintenance of tissues in culture, which may
   alter the secondary metabolism of plants. The objective of this study
   was to evaluate growth and secondary metabolism of in vitro shoots of H.
   perforatum on short and long term maintenance of cultures (30 and 100
   days). The effect of BA and NAA supplementation was evaluated during 30
   days of culture. Adventitious shoots were cultivated on MS medium
   supplemented with 4.4mM BA alone or in combination with 0.05mM NAA for
   30 days. A hormone-free medium was used as control. Shoots cultivated
   for 100 days were maintained in presence of 4.4mM BA. Biomass,
   multiplication of shoots, contents of phenolic compounds, flavonoids and
   hypericin were evaluated. No difference between BA and BA+NAA was
   observed on growth, multiplication of shoots and levels of flavonoids at
   the end of 30 days of culture. Production of phenolic compounds was
   promoted by addition of BA+NAA to the medium, whereas hypericin was
   increased by the presence of BA. The time of culture (30 and 100 days)
   affected all the parameters analyzed, except the levels of flavonoids in
   the short term experiment.}},

   system was quickly lowered from 5 similar to-80 degrees C) were
   determined. For the CaCl2-H2O system, with the decrease of the
   temperature, ice or CaCl2 center dot 6H(2)O was precipitated at the
   temperature range of -10 similar to-60 degrees C. For the LiCl-H2O
   system, ice or LiCl center dot H2O was obtained as the solid phase at
   the temperature range of 5 similar to-80 degrees C. For CaCl2-NaCl-H2O
   system, CaCl2 center dot 6H(2)O or NaCl ice was precipitated at the

   CaCl2-H2O, LiCl-H2O and NaCl-CaCl2-H2O systems are consistent with the
   outcomes of the corresponding phase diagrams. According to the

   Sample preparation was performed using alkaline extraction and

   Precision was better for the QqLIT and QqQ systems (7-15\%) than for the
   IT system (10-17\%). The QqLIT (working in SRM mode) and QqQ systems
   offered a linear dynamic range of at least 3 orders of magnitude,
   whereas that of the IT system was 2 orders of magnitude. The QqLIT
   system achieved at least 20-fold higher sensitivity than the QqQ system,
   and this was at least tenfold higher sensitivity than for the IT system.
   In the IT system, identification was based on sensitive full mass range
   acquisition and MS (n) fragmentation and in the QqLIT system, it was
   based on the use of an information-dependent-acquisition scan function,
   which allows the combination of an SRM or MS full scan acting as the
   survey scan and an enhanced product ion scan followed by MS3 as the
   dependent scan in the same analysis. Three instruments were applied to
   monitor the content in fish and shellfish (anchovies, swordfish, tuna,
   mussels, and oysters) obtained from Valencia and Barcelona markets
   (Spain). The eight target PFCs were detected at mean concentrations in
   the range from 10 ng kg(-1) (perfluoro-7-methyloctanoic acid and
   perfluoro-1-decanesulfonate) to 4,200 ng kg(-1) (perfluoropentanoic
   acid). Furthermore, perfluoroheptanoic and perfluoroundecanoic acids
   (not covered as target analytes) were identified in some samples.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A total environmental cleaning system based on microfiber
   technology was implemented within 2 intensive care units (ICUs). The
   efficacy of this modified cleaning program was assessed using adenosine
   triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence.
   Methods: A team of trained hygiene technicians cleaned all near-patient
   furniture and equipment twice a day using ultramicrofiber cloths. Every
   week for 40 weeks, 10 surfaces within a randomly selected bed area were
   sampled using the 3M Clean-Trace Clinical Hygiene Monitoring System (3M
   Health Care Ltd, Loughborough, United Kingdom). The ability of the
   modified cleaning program to reduce surface contamination to
   ``acceptable{''} levels was measured against previously proposed
   benchmark ATP values.
   Results: In comparison with normal cleaning procedures routinely carried
   out by the nurses, the modified cleaning program significantly reduced
   (P < .001) the ATP readings obtained from surfaces within the
   near-patient environment. In both ICUs, 95\% of surfaces sampled after
   modified cleaning had relative light unit values of <500 and were deemed
   ``clean.{''} Almost 90\% of the surfaces could also be ``passed{''}
   using the more stringent benchmark value of 250 relative light units.
   However, regardless of benchmark value used, the majority of surfaces
   sampled could also be considered adequately clean prior to them being
   cleaned by the hygiene technicians.
   Conclusion: The use of ATP bioluminescence has been proposed as a means
   to improve the management of hospital cleaning. Use of benchmark values
   can help continually monitor the efficacy of existing cleaning programs.
   However, when evaluating novel or new cleaning practices, baseline
   cleanliness (ie, the level of cleanliness routinely achieved using
   normal cleaning procedures) must also be taken into consideration, or
   the efficacy of modified cleaning will be overestimated.}},

   disk galaxy, the Sombrero, and NGC 4594. We consider whether the
   metallicity distribution function (MDF) in the observed field matches
   that of elliptical galaxies of some luminosity, and what these data
   imply for the accretion and enrichment model that can be fitted to the
   MDF. The MDF of NGC 4594 is similar to that of the elliptical galaxy of
   similar luminosity, NGC 5128. The field we are probing is a combination
   of the galaxy's bulge and halo.}},

Abstract = {{Fat embolization following major trauma is reported to be a quite common
   event, while the clinical fat embolism syndrome (FES) seems to be a much
   rarer event. Fat embolism occurs in 2 up to 23\% of patients with
   isolated femoral shaft fractures. This complication appears to be
   related not only to the fracture, but also to the timing of
   stabilization. Sometimes it may be impossible to perform histochemical
   reactions on frozen sections to detect fat emboli thus confirming
   diagnosis or suspicion of FES. The finding of fibrinogen and platelets
   around the apparently empty spaces in the blood vessels has been
   proposed as an evidence for vital reaction due to either a vital
   cellular reaction or a flotation mechanism, thus supporting an
   intravital fat embolism. We report a fatal case due to fat embolism
   syndrome in a young man hospitalized for a right femoral neck fracture,
   treated with orthopaedic surgery and subjected to an intra-surgery
   transesophageal echocardiography that revealed embolization of numerous
   highly echogenic bodies. Four hours after the onset of clinical symptoms
   the man died from respiratory failure. The autopsy confirmed the
   clinical diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome. The histological
   examination revealed a large amount of fat globules in cerebral and
   pulmonary arteries and in glomerular capillaries, as well as fibrin and
   platelet deposition confirmed by the positive results by Sudan III
   staining for lipids and immunohistochemistry with anti-CD61 and
   anti-fibrinogen antibodies. The quantitative classification of fat
   embolism was grade 3 of Sevitt's classification or grade 4 of Fineschi's
   quantification, according to the current quantitative microscopic
   methods used for grading fat embolism in pulmonary tissue. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{We present a series of numerical simulations aimed at understanding the
   nature and origin of turbulence in coronal loops in the framework of the
   Parker model for coronal heating. A coronal loop is studied via reduced
   magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations in Cartesian geometry. A uniform
   and strong magnetic field threads the volume between the two
   photospheric planes, where a velocity field in the form of a
   one-dimensional shear flow pattern is present. Initially, the magnetic
   field that develops in the coronal loop is a simple map of the
   photospheric velocity field. This initial configuration is unstable to a
   multiple tearing instability that develops islands with X and O points
   in the plane orthogonal to the axial field. Once the nonlinear stage
   sets in the system evolution is characterized by a regime of MHD
   turbulence dominated by magnetic energy. A well-developed power law in
   energy spectra is observed and the magnetic field never returns to the
   simple initial state mapping the photospheric flow. The formation of X
   and O points in the planes orthogonal to the axial field allows the
   continued and repeated formation and dissipation of small-scale current
   sheets where the plasma is heated. We conclude that the observed
   turbulent dynamics are not induced by the complexity of the pattern that
   the magnetic field-line footpoints follow but they rather stem from the
   inherent nonlinear nature of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of climate change increasingly recognize the diverse influences
   exerted by terpenes in the atmosphere, including roles in particulates,
   ozone formation, and their oxidizing potential. Measurements of key
   terpenes suggest atmospheric concentrations ranging from low pmol/mol
   (parts per trillion) to nmol/mol (parts per billion), depending on
   location and compound. To accurately establish concentration trends,
   assess the role of terpenes in atmospheric chemistry, and relate
   measurement records from many laboratories and researchers, it is
   essential to have good calibration standards. The feasibility of
   preparing well-characterized, stable gas cylinder standards for terpenes
   at the nmol/mol level is not yet well established. Several of the
   world's National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) are researching the
   feasibility of developing primary and secondary reference gas standards
   at the nmol/mol level for terpenes. The US NMI, the National Institute
   of Standards and Technology, has prepared several nmol/mol mixtures, in
   treated aluminum gas cylinders, containing terpenes in dry nitrogen at
   nominal 5 nmol/mol for stability studies. Overall, 11 terpenes were
   studied for stability. An initial gas mixture containing nine terpenes,
   one oxygenate, and six aromatic compounds, including benzene as an
   internal standard, was prepared. Results for four of the nine terpenes
   in this initial mixture indicate stability in these treated aluminum gas
   cylinders for over 6 months and project long term (years) stability.
   Interesting results were seen for beta-pinene, which when using a linear
   equation rate decline predicts that it will reach a zero concentration
   level at day 416. At the same time, increases in alpha-pinene,
   D-limonene (R-(+)-limonene), and p-cymene were observed, including
   camphene, a terpene not prepared in the gas mixture, indicating a
   chemical transformation of beta-pinene to these species. Additional
   mixtures containing combination of either alpha-pinene, camphor,
   alpha-terpinene, and benzene indicate a second-order quadratic rate
   decline for the alpha-pinene and alpha-terpinene, a linear rate decline
   for camphor, and a second-order quadratic rate increase of camphene.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of pharmaceutical counterfeiting is a major public health
   problem. This growth is resulting in a proportional increase in the
   number of samples that medicines control laboratories have to test. Thus
   the need for simple and affordable preliminary screening methods to be
   used by inspectors to decide in the field whether to collect a sample
   for further laboratory analysis or not. This paper intends to evaluate
   the possibility to employ for preliminary examinations of suspicious
   samples an optical spectrophotometer (colorimeter) used in the graphic
   industry, capable of measuring the reflectance visible spectrum of solid
   materials. The colorimeter was tested on original and counterfeited
   Viagra, Cialis and Levitra by measuring the colour of tablets' surface
   and of a specific spot of the packages. Various batches of the original
   drugs were employed both to investigate precision and robustness of the
   technique and to build spectral libraries. These libraries were used to
   compare suspicious samples to the corresponding original by means of a
   wavelength distance pattern recognition method. The method was
   eventually tested on suspicious samples sized by police authorities in
   order to evaluate its effectiveness. The device resulted precise and
   robust toward ambient conditions changes, although some limits emerged:
   the libraries of original samples need a frequent update and a lower
   precision is to be expected for tablets which surface is extremely
   convex. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Transit light curves for stellar continua have only one minimum and a
   ``U{''} shape. By contrast, transit curves for optically thin
   chromospheric emission lines can have a ``W{''} shape because of stellar
   limb brightening. We calculate light curves for an optically thin shell
   of emission and fit these models to time-resolved observations of Si IV
   absorption by the planet HD 209458b. We find that the best-fit Si IV
   absorption model has R-p,R-Si IV/R-{*} = 0.34(-0.12)(+0.07), similar to
   the Roche lobe of the planet. While the large radius is only at the
   limit of statistical significance, we develop formulae applicable to
   transits of all optically thin chromospheric emission lines.}},

Title = {{GROUP FINDING IN THE STELLAR HALO USING M-GIANTS IN THE TWO MICRON ALL

Abstract = {{A density-based hierarchical group-finding algorithm is used to identify
   stellar halo structures in a catalog of M-giants from the Two Micron All
   Sky Survey (2MASS). The intrinsic brightness of M-giant stars means that
   this catalog probes deep into the halo where substructures are expected
   to be abundant and easy to detect. Our analysis reveals 16 structures at
   high Galactic latitude (greater than 15 degrees), of which 10 have been
   previously identified. Among the six new structures, two could plausibly
   be due to masks applied to the data, one is associated with a strong
   extinction region, and one is probably a part of the Monoceros Ring.
   Another one originates at low latitudes, suggesting some contamination
   from disk stars, but also shows protrusions extending to high latitudes,
   implying that it could be a real feature in the stellar halo. The last
   remaining structure is free from the defects discussed above and hence
   is very likely a satellite remnant. Although the extinction in the
   direction of the structure is very low, the structure does match a
   low-temperature feature in the dust maps. While this casts some doubt on
   its origin, the low-temperature feature could plausibly be due to real
   dust in the structure itself. The angular position and distance of this
   structure encompass the Pisces overdensity traced by RR Lyraes in Stripe
   82 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). However, the 2MASS M-giants
   indicate that the structure is much more extended than what is visible
   with the SDSS, with the point of peak density lying just outside Stripe
   82. The morphology of the structure is more like a cloud than a stream
   and reminiscent of that seen in simulations of satellites disrupting
   along highly eccentric orbits. This finding is consistent with
   expectations of structure formation within the currently favored
   cosmological model: assuming the cosmologically predicted satellite
   orbit distributions are correct, prior work indicates that such clouds
   should be the dominant debris structures at large Galactocentric radii
   (similar to 100 kpc and beyond).}},

Abstract = {{Activation of P2X7 receptors by endogenous ATP contributes to the
   development of inflammatory hyperalgesia. Given the clinical importance
   of mechanical hyperalgesia in inflammatory states, we hypothesized that
   the activation of the P2X7 receptor by endogenous ATP contributes to
   carrageenan-induced mechanical hyperalgesia, and that this contribution
   is mediated by an indirect sensitization of the primary afferent
   nociceptors. Co-administration of the selective P2X7 receptor
   antagonist, A-438079, or the P2X7 receptor antagonist, oATP, with
   carrageenan blocked the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan
   and significantly reduced the increased concentration of TNF-alpha, IL-6
   and CINC-1, but not of IL-1 beta induced by carrageenan in the
   subcutaneous tissue of the rat's hind paw. We concluded that the
   activation of P2X7 receptors by endogenous ATP is essential to the
   development of the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan in the
   subcutaneous tissue. It is suggested that this essential role of P2X7
   receptors in the development of carrageenan-induced mechanical
   hyperalgesia is mediated by an indirect sensitization of the primary
   afferent nociceptors dependent on the previous release of TNF-alpha,
   IL-6 and CINC-1, but not of IL-1 beta. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Healthcare workers as parents: attitudes toward vaccinating their
   children against pandemic influenza A/H1N1}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Both the health care workers (HCWs) and children are target
   groups for pandemic influenza vaccination. The coverage of the target
   populations is an important determinant for impact of mass vaccination.
   The objective of this study is to determine the attitudes of HCWs as
   parents, toward vaccinating their children with pandemic influenza
   A/H1N1 vaccine.
   Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted with
   health care workers (HCWs) in a public hospital during December 2009 in
   Istanbul. All persons employed in the hospital with or without a
   health-care occupation are accepted as HCW. The HCWs who are parents of
   children 6 months to 18 years of age were included in the study.
   Pearson's chi-square test and logistic regression analysis was applied
   for the statistical analyses.
   Results: A total of 389 HCWs who were parents of children aged 6
   months-18 years participated study. Among all participants 27.0\% (n =
   105) reported that themselves had been vaccinated against pandemic
   influenza A/H1N1. Two third (66.1\%) of the parents answered that they
   will not vaccinate their children, 21.1\% already vaccinated and 12.9\%
   were still undecided. Concern about side effect was most reported reason
   among who had been not vaccinated their children and among undecided
   parents. The second reason for refusing the pandemic vaccine was
   concerns efficacy of the vaccine. Media was the only source of
   information about pandemic influenza in nearly one third of HCWs.
   Agreement with vaccine safety, self receipt of pandemic influenza A/H1N1
   vaccine, and trust in Ministry of Health were found to be associated
   with the positive attitude toward vaccinating their children against
   pandemic influenza A/H1N1.
   Conclusions: Persuading parents to accept a new vaccine seems not be
   easy even if they are HCWs. In order to overcome the barriers among HCWs
   related to pandemic vaccines, determination of their misinformation,
   attitudes and behaviors regarding the pandemic influenza vaccination is
   necessary. Efforts for orienting the HCWs to use evidence based
   scientific sources, rather than the media for information should be
   considered by the authorities.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of proteolytic enzymes in urine samples, coming from
   exogenous or endogenous sources, enhances the cleavage of human
   chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Moreover, elevated temperatures occurring
   occasionally during the delayed transportation of sport urine samples,
   favor the nicking of the hCG molecule. The aim of the current study,
   funded by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), was the application of a
   stabilization mixture in athletes' urine samples to chemically
   inactivate proteolytic enzymes coming from exogenous or endogenous
   sources so as to prevent the degradation of hCG. The stabilization
   mixture applied, already tested for the stabilization of endogenous
   steroids and recombinant erythropoietin (rEPO), was a combination of
   antibiotics, antimycotic substances, and protease inhibitors. Incubation
   experiments were conducted in the presence or absence of the
   stabilization mixture in urine aliquots spiked with six proteases (first
   series of experiments) and one microorganism associated with urinary
   tract infections (UTI) (second series of experiments). Intact hCG levels
   were evaluated by using the EIAgen Total hCG kit. In the first series of
   experiments, hCG levels were reduced in the untreated aliquots following
   incubation at 37 A degrees C. The addition of the chemical stabilization
   mixture prevented degradation of hCG induced by four of the proteases
   applied. In the second series of experiments, no significant difference
   was found in urine inoculated with E. coli, between aliquots treated
   with chemical mixture and the untreated aliquots. The addition of the
   proposed chemical stabilization mixture improves the quality of
   athletes' urine samples against possible deterioration due to high
   temperatures or attempts of proteolytic manipulation.}},

Abstract = {{Interferometers are key elements in radial velocity (RV) experiments in
   astronomy observations, and accurate calibration of the group delay of
   an interferometer is required for high precision measurements. A novel
   field-compensated white light scanning Michelson interferometer is
   introduced as an interferometer calibration tool. The optical path
   difference (OPD) scanning was achieved by translating a compensation
   prism, such that even if the light source were in low spatial coherence,
   the interference stays spatially phase coherent over a large
   interferometer scanning range. In the wavelength region of 500-560 nm, a
   multimode fiber-coupled LED was used as the light source, and high
   optical efficiency was essential in elevating the signal-to-noise ratio
   of the interferogram signal. The achromatic OPD scanning required a
   one-time calibration, and two methods using dual-laser wavelength
   references and an iodine absorption spectrum reference were employed and
   cross-verified. In an experiment measuring the group delay of a fixed
   Michelson interferometer, Fourier analysis was employed to process the
   interferogram data. The group delay was determined at an accuracy of 1 x
   10(-5), and the phase angle precision was typically 2.5 x 10(-6) over
   the wide wavelength region. (C) 2010 Optical Society of America}},

   relationship between the surface morphology and hydrophobicity was
   studied by testing the WCA of the prepared silica coatings. The result
   shows that nano silica particle with -CH3 group can be obtained by
   sol-gel method using TEOS and MTES as precursors, the micro-nano dual
   size structure silica particles were formed duo to self-assemble effect
   during aging process. This special structure plays an essential role in
   trapping air between the substrate surface and the liquid droplets.
   Combining with the low energy surface of -CH3 group of the silica, a
   superhydrophobic surface with high contact angle and low contact angle
   hysteresis was prepared.}},

Abstract = {{Variable ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), which are considered to be
   black hole binaries (BHBs), are known to show state transitions similar
   to Galactic BHBs. However, the relation between the ULX states and the
   Galactic BHB states is still unclear, primarily due to the less
   well-understood behaviors of ULXs in contrast to the Galactic BHBs.
   Here, we report a statistical X-ray spectral study of 34 energy spectra
   from seven bright ULXs in the interacting galaxy systems M 51 and NGC
   4490/85, using archive data from multiple Chandra and XMM-Newton
   observations spanning a few years. In order to compare them with
   Galactic BHB states, we applied representative spectral models of BHBs-a
   power-law (PL), a multi-color disk blackbody (MCD), and a slim-disk
   model-to all the ULX spectra. We found a hint of a bimodal structure in
   the luminosity distribution of the samples, suggesting that ULXs have
   two states that respectively have typical luminosities of (3-6) x 10(39)
   and (1.5-3) x 10(39) ergs s(-1). Most spectra in the brighter state are
   explained by the MCD or the slim-disk model, whereas those in the
   fainter state are explained by the PL model. In particular, the
   slim-disk model successfully explains the observed spectral variations
   of NGC 4490/85 ULX-6 and ULX-8 by changes of the mass accretion rate to
   a black hole of an estimated mass of <40 M-circle dot. From the best-fit
   model parameters of each state, we speculate that the brighter state in
   these two ULXs corresponds to the brightest state of Galactic BHBs,
   which is often called the ``apparently standard state.{''} The fainter
   state of the ULXs has a PL-shaped spectrum, but the photon index range
   is much wider than that seen in any single state of Galactic BHBs. We
   thus speculate that it is a state unique to ULXs. Some sources show much
   fainter and steeper spectra than the faint state, which we identified as
   yet another state.}},

Abstract = {{background: Studies on the effects of bilirubin on cardiovascular
   disease have typically focused only on total serum bilirubin composed
   with direct bilirubin plus indirect bilirubin. In this study, we
   examined which type of fasting bilirubin is more associated with the
   metabolic syndrome (MS).
   Methods: Five thousand six hundred and fifty-four individuals who
   visited the Center for Health Promotion for a periodic medical health
   check-up were screened for inclusion in the study. We excluded subjects
   who had a chronic viral liver disease, an alcoholic liver disease, or an
   abnormal liver function defined as a serum aspartate aminotransferase or
   alanine aminotransferase >100 IU/l, a gamma glutamyltransferase >100
   IU/l, or a fasting total bilirubin level >3 mg/dl.
   Results: In men, only fasting direct bilirubin levels decreased with an
   increase in the number of MS components (p = 0.001). However, all three
   types of fasting bilirubin decreased when the subjects had more
   components of MS (p<0.001) in women. Both in men and women fasting
   direct bilirubin levels were related with the MS (p for trend =0.003 in
   men and <0.001 in women) after the adjustments for age, body mass index,
   smoking, alcohol drinking, exercise habits, and presence of fatty liver.
   The odds ratio (95\% confidence interval) of MS for each fasting direct
   bilirubin quartile was 0.88 (0.59-1.29), 0.63 (0.42-0.95), 0.61
   (0.38-0.97) in men, and 0.66 (0.50-0.87), 0.52 (0.35-0.78). 0.27
   (0.12-0.59) in women, respectively. However, fasting total and indirect
   bilirubin levels were related with the MS in women, but not in men.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that MS is more related to the fasting
   direct bilirubin in Korean adults than the other types of fasting
   bilirubin. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Young adult male Wistar rats, a species commonly used in inhalation
   toxicity studies, and OF1 mice, a species often used in sensory
   irritation studies, were simultaneously nose-only exposed for 45-min to
   ammonia in concentrations from 92 to 1243 mg/m(3). This study examined
   airway reflexes by the changes in respiratory patterns elicited by
   ammonia in either dry, steam-humidified (approximately 95\% relative
   humidity) or aqueous aerosol containing atmospheres. This served the
   objective to explore whether high concentrations of anhydrous ammonia
   and/or high humidity and aqueous aerosol change the predominant nasal
   deposition site to more distal locations in the lung. Animals from all
   groups tolerated the exposure without evidence of respiratory tract
   irritation, changes in body and lung weights. The evoked changes on
   breathing patterns resembled those known to occur following exposure to
   `upper respiratory tract sensory irritants', rapid in onset and
   reversibility. Reflex stimulation from the lower airways was not
   observed in any group. While mice showed some adaption during the 45-min
   exposure period, rats displayed more stable changes in respiratory
   patterns. In this species humidity- or aqueous aerosol-related changes
   in sensory irritation potency did not occur to any appreciable extent.
   The respiratory decrease 50\%, RD50, was 972 and 905 mg/m(3) in dry and
   wet air, respectively. In contrast, mice appeared to more susceptible to
   ammonia in presence of dry air (the RD50, was 582 and 732 mg/m(3) in dry
   and wet air, respectively). In summary, it was shown that the sensory
   irritation potency of ammonia does not increase when inhaling wet
   atmospheres nor penetrates this gas into the lower airways up to 1243
   mg/m(3) x 45-min. The mild-to-moderate sensory irritation-related
   effects observed at approximate to 400 mg/m(3) (571 ppm) x 45-min do not
   appear to be offensive enough to impair escape as a result of upper
   airway sensations. Interestingly, this rat-based estimate matches almost
   exactly the experienced-based RAM TRAC recommendations of 696 and 492
   ppm for 30 and 60 min, respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The objective of this prospective study was to characterize the
   metabolism of risperidone to (+)- and (-)-9-hydroxyrisperidone in vivo
   and to evaluate the influence of CYP2D6 genotype. A population
   pharmacokinetic modeling approach was used to estimate the
   interindividual variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters in 50
   hospitalized patients with acute episode of schizophrenia. CYP2D6
   genotype remarkably influenced the formation clearances of the
   risperidone metabolites, while creatinine clearance was related to the
   plasma clearance of 9-hydroxyrisperidone. CYP2D6 genotype was also
   associated with the average plasma concentration of risperidone active
   moiety (a sum of all three active compounds). In comparison to the
   patients with CYP2D6{*}1/{*}1 genotype, average steady-state plasma
   concentration of risperidone active moiety was 3.3- and 1.6-fold higher
   in poor metabolizers (both alleles nonfunctional; CYP2D6{*}3 or {*}4)
   and intermediate metabolizers (one nonfunctional allele and one allele
   for diminished enzyme activity: CYP2D6{*}10 or {*}41), respectively.
   Additionally, average plasma concentration of risperidone active moiety
   was higher in the patients with dystonia (p = 0.0066) and parkinsonism
   (p = 0.046). The results of this study imply the potential role of
   CYP2D6 genotyping in personalizing risperidone therapy in patients with
   schizophrenia to reduce the incidence of adverse extrapyramidal
   symptoms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Using the very high frequency (46.5 MHz) middle and upper atmosphere
   radar (MUR), Ka band (35 GHz) and X band (9.8 GHz) weather radars, a
   Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability occurring at a cloud base and its
   impact on modulating cloud bottom altitudes are described by a case
   study on 8 October 2008 at the Shigaraki MU Observatory, Japan (34.85
   degrees N, 136.10 degrees E). KH braids were monitored by the MUR along
   the slope of a cloud base gradually rising with time around an altitude
   of similar to 5.0 km. The KH braids had a horizontal wavelength of about
   3.6 km and maximum crest-to-trough amplitude of about 1.6 km. Nearly
   monochromatic and out of phase vertical air motion oscillations
   exceeding +/- 3 m s(-1) with a period of similar to 3 min 20 s were
   measured by the MUR above and below the cloud base. The axes of the
   billows were at right angles of the wind and wind shear both oriented
   east-north-east at their altitude. The isotropy of the radar echoes and
   the large variance of Doppler velocity in the KH billows (including the
   braids) indicate the presence of strong turbulence at the Bragg (similar
   to 3.2 m) scale. After the passage of the cloud system, the KH waves
   rapidly damped and the vertical scale of the KH braids progressively
   decreased down to about 100 m before their disappearance. The radar
   observations suggest that the interface between clear air and cloud was
   conducive to the presence of the dynamical shear instability by reducing
   static stability (and then the Richardson number) near the cloud base.
   Downward cloudy protuberances detected by the Ka band radar had vertical
   and horizontal scales of about 0.6-1.1 and 3.2 km, respectively, and
   were clearly associated with the downward air motions. Observed
   oscillations of the reflectivity-weighted Doppler velocity measured by
   the X band radar indicate that falling ice particles underwent the
   vertical wind motions generated by the KH instability to form the
   protuberances. The protuberances at the cloud base might be either KH
   billow clouds or perhaps some sort of mamma. Reflectivity-weighted
   particle fall velocity computed from Doppler velocities measured by the
   X band radar and the MUR showed an average value of 1.3 ms(-1) within
   the cloud and in the protuberance environment.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This cross-sectional study was performed to determine the
   reference ranges for two bone turnover markers-aminoterminal propeptide
   of type I collagen (P1NP) and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen
   (beta-CTX) in normal adult Spanish men as measured in serum by automated
   methods.
   Methods: A community-based population of 660 healthy men >= 50 years was
   evaluated. Fasting serum levels of P1NP, beta-CTX, 25-hydroxyvitamin D,
   and intact parathyroid hormone were measured on the Elecsys 2010
   automated analyzer (Roche). BMD at lumbar spine, femoral neck and total
   hip was determined by DXA.
   Results: Mean age of participants was 65 +/- 9 years. Logarithmic
   transformation of both markers was performed to allow for normal
   distribution. Mid-95\% ranges for P1NP and beta-CTX were 15-78 ng/ml and
   0.069-0.760 ng/ml. respectively. Median and interquartile range of serum
   P1NP and beta-CTX were 33.5 {[}25.5;44.4] ng/ml and 027 {[}10.19;0.38]
   ng/ml, respectively. Mean values of P1NP (37.1 +/- 16.7 ng/ml) were
   similar to those previously described. beta-CTX mean values (0.300 +/-
   0.171 ng/ml) were also similar to those quoted by the manufacturers in
   men younger than 70 years, but slightly lower than those reported in
   subjects older than 70 years. Both markers were higher among
   osteoporotic men. After excluding from the analysis those men who were
   found to have BMD below -2.5 T-score, 25OHD serum level below 30 ng/ml
   or serum PTH above 65 pg/ml, PINP and beta-CTX ranges were 17-71 ng/ml
   and 0.070-0.681 ng/ml, again respectively.
   Conclusions: Values obtained from this well-characterized population
   study provide reference ranges for serum automated P1NP and beta-CD in
   normal Spanish adult men. (C) 2010 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Construction of an almond linkage map in an Australian population
   Nonpareil x Lauranne}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Despite a high genetic similarity to peach, almonds (Prunus
   dulcis) have a fleshless fruit and edible kernel, produced as a crop for
   human consumption. While the release of peach genome v1.0 provides an
   excellent opportunity for almond genetic and genomic studies,
   well-assessed segregating populations and the respective saturated
   genetic linkage maps lay the foundation for such studies to be completed
   in almond.
   Results: Using an almond intraspecific cross between `Nonpareil' and
   `Lauranne' (N x L), we constructed a moderately saturated map with SSRs,
   SNPs, ISSRs and RAPDs. The N x L map covered 591.4 cM of the genome with
   157 loci. The average marker distance of the map was 4.0 cM. The map
   displayed high synteny and colinearity with the Prunus T x E reference
   map in all eight linkage groups (G1-G8). The positions of 14 mapped
   gene-anchored SNPs corresponded approximately with the positions of
   homologous sequences in the peach genome v1.0. Analysis of Mendelian
   segregation ratios showed that 17.9\% of markers had significantly
   skewed genotype ratios at the level of P < 0.05. Due to the large number
   of skewed markers in the linkage group 7, the potential existence of
   deleterious gene(s) was assessed in the group. Integrated maps produced
   by two different mapping methods using JoinMap (R) 3 were compared, and
   their high degree of similarity was evident despite the positional
   inconsistency of a few markers.
   Conclusions: We presented a moderately saturated Australian almond map,
   which is highly syntenic and collinear with the Prunus reference map and
   peach genome V1.0. Therefore, the well-assessed almond population
   reported here can be used to investigate the traits of interest under
   Australian growing conditions, and provides more information on the
   almond genome for the international community.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Non-small cell cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately
   80\% of all lung cancers. Reports suggested an association between the
   interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) -31 and -511 gene loci and NSCLC, but few
   studies took into account the effect of smoking and/or alcohol drinking
   on the association.
   Methods: Two-hundred thirteen cases of NSCLC (aged 58.2 +/- 10.1) and
   213 controls (aged 59.4 +/- 10.3 y) were included in this research.
   Information about the smoking and drinking behaviors, dietary customs,
   and anamnesis were obtained from all subjects by questionnaires, and
   genomic DNA was extracted. IL-1 beta -31 and -511 gene polymorphisms
   were detected using PCR-RFLP. The interactions between the genotypes and
   alcohol drinking/smoking were analyzed using multivariate logistic
   regression models.
   Results: (The T/T genotype and the T allele of the IL-1 beta -31 gene
   were associated with higher incidence of NSCLC (P<0.05). For the IL-1
   beta -511 locus, no difference was found in different genotypes between
   the NSCLC and control groups. After the adjustment of confounding
   variables, such as age and gender, the binary logistic analysis showed a
   significant gene-environment interaction (P<0.05).
   Conclusions: The IL-1 beta -31T allele was positively associated with a
   risk of NSCLC, and the carriers of IL-1 beta -31T/T or -511C/C would
   have a higher risk of suffering from NSCLC if they drank alcohol or
   smoke heavily. (C) 2010 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Jurassic to Cretaceous magmatism in the South China Block (SCB) has
   important geological significance for its tectonic evolution,
   particularly, the tectonic regime change. We report here new SHRIMP
   zircon U-Pb ages, geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic results from the Early
   Jurassic magmatic rocks in eastern Nanling region of southern Jiangxi
   and northern Guangdong provinces, SE China, The SHRIMP zircon U-Pb
   analyses yield consistent Early Jurassic ages of 193 +/- 2 Ma for
   granodiorite and 196 +/- 1 Ma for gabbro-diabase from the Hanhu complex
   of southern Jiangxi Province. Field observation indicates that the
   gabbro-diabase coexists with syenite in granodiorite, and that the mafic
   components infiltrate into the syenite. Combined with the SHRIMP zircon
   U-Pb ages of 196 +/- 2 Ma for granites and 195 +/- 1 Ma for gabbros of
   the Xialan complex of northern Guangdong province, these contemporary
   ages represent an earliest tectono-magmatic events during the Yanshanian
   orogeny. These results reveal that there are tectonic extension and the
   post-collisional and intraplate magmatism events at or before 196 Ma, in
   contrast to the wide believed quiescent stage (205-180 Ma) of magmatic
   activity in SE China. The confirmation of these tectono-magmatic events
   in the eastern Nanling area thus sheds new light on the quiescent stage
   of magmatic activity in SE China during 205-180 Ma and provides new

Abstract = {{Background: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a rare hereditary disorder
   predominantly affecting the skin, the eyes and the cardiovascular
   system. The disease is caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene and
   characterized by ectopic calcification and extracellular matrix (ECM)
   alterations. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a pivotal role in the
   process of ECM remodeling and are likely implied in PXE pathology. The
   aim of the present study was to investigate the association of single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter of the MMP2 gene, and
   PXE.
   Methods: We evaluated the allelic distribution of five SNPs in the MMP2
   promoter in DNA samples from 168 German patients affected by PXE and in
   168 healthy, age- and sex-matched control subjects using restriction
   fragment length polymorphism analysis.
   Results: The alleles c.-1575G, c.-1306C, and c.-790T were more abundant
   in the PXE patients' group. Furthermore, the haplotype GCTCG was
   significantly associated with PXE (OR 1.56, 95\% CI 1.14-2.12,
   P-corrected = 0.026).
   Conclusions: Our results may indicate an involvement of MMP2 in the
   pathology of PXE. The promoter polymorphisms associated with PXE may
   lead to increased MMP2 expression and thereby contribute to the elevated
   proteolytic activity observed in PXE in vitro and in vivo. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{A quantitative description of the relationship between protein
   expression levels and open reading frame (ORF) nucleotide sequences is
   important for understanding natural systems, designing synthetic
   systems, and optimizing heterologous expression. Codon identity, mRNA
   secondary structure, and nucleotide composition within ORFs markedly
   influence expression levels. Bioinformatic analysis of ORF sequences in
   816 bacterial genomes revealed that these features show distinct
   regional trends. To investigate their effects on protein expression, we
   designed 285 synthetic genes and determined corresponding expression
   levels in vitro using Escherichia coli extracts. We developed a
   mathematical function, parameterized using this synthetic gene data set,
   which enables computation of protein expression levels from ORF
   nucleotide sequences. In addition to its practical application in the
   design of heterologous expression systems, this equation provides
   mechanistic insight into the factors that control translation
   efficiency. We found that expression is strongly dependent on the
   presence of high AU content and low secondary structure in the ORF 5'
   region. Choice of high-frequency codons contributes to a lesser extent.
   The 3' terminal AU content makes modest, but detectable contributions.
   We present a model for the effect of these factors on the three phases
   of ribosomal function: initiation, elongation, and termination. (C) 2010

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to model the effect of pore size
   heterogeneity and pore connectivity on permeability. Our approach is
   that of conceptual modeling based on network simulations. We simulated
   fluid flow through pipe networks with different coordination numbers and
   different pipe radius distributions. Following a method widely used in
   percolation theory, we sought ``universal{''} relationships (i.e.,
   independent of lattice type) between macroscopic properties such as
   permeability k and porosity phi, and, pore geometry attributes such as
   hydraulic radius r(H), coordination number z, and so forth. Our main
   result was that in three-dimensional simple cubic, FCC, and BCC
   networks, permeability obeyed ``universal{''} power laws, k proportional
   to (z - z(c))(beta), where the exponent beta is a function of the
   standard deviation of the pore radius distribution and z(c) = 1.5 is the
   percolation threshold expressed in terms of the coordination number.
   Most importantly, these power law relationships hold in a wide domain,
   from z close to zc to the maximum possible values of z. A permeability
   model was inferred on the basis of the power laws mentioned above. It
   was satisfactorily tested by comparison with published, experimental,
   and microstructural data on Fontainebleau sandstone.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{40}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{We present a systematic study of the reconstruction of non-negative
   functions via maximum entropy approach utilizing the information
   contained in a finite number of moments of the functions. For testing
   the efficacy of the approach, we reconstruct a set of functions using an
   iterative entropy optimization scheme, and study the convergence profile
   as the number of moments is increased. A wide variety of functions are
   considered that include a distribution with a sharp discontinuity, an
   oscillatory function, a distribution with singularities and finally a
   distribution with several spikes and fine structure. The last example is
   important in the context of the determination of the natural density of
   the logistic map. The convergence of the method is studied by comparing
   the moments of the approximated functions with the exact ones.
   Furthermore, by varying the number of moments and iterations, we examine
   to what extent the features of the functions, such as the divergence
   behavior at singular points within the interval, is reproduced. The
   proximity of the reconstructed maximum entropy solution to the exact
   solution is examined via Kullback-Leibler divergence and variation
   measures for different number of moments.}},

Title = {{Trends in Loss to Follow-Up among Migrant Workers on Antiretroviral
   Therapy in a Community Cohort in Lesotho}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: The provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to migrant
   populations raises particular challenges with respect to ensuring
   adequate treatment support, adherence, and retention in care. We
   assessed rates of loss to follow-up for migrant workers compared with
   non-migrant workers in a routine treatment programme in Morjia, Lesotho.
   Design: All adult patients (>= 18 years) initiating ART between January
   1, 2008, and December 31, 2008, and followed up until the end of 2009,
   were included in the study. We described rates of loss to follow-up
   according to migrant status by Kaplan-Meier estimates, and used Poisson
   regression to model associations between migrant status and loss to
   follow-up controlling for potential confounders identified a priori.
   Results: Our cohort comprised 1185 people, among whom 12\% (148) were
   migrant workers. Among the migrant workers, median age was 36.1
   (29.6-45.9) and the majority (55\%) were male. We found no statistically
   significant differences between baseline characteristics and migrant
   status. Rates of lost to follow up were similar between migrants and
   non-migrants in the first 3 months but differences increased thereafter.
   Between 3 and 6 months after initiating antiretroviral therapy, migrants
   had a 2.78-fold increased rate of defaulting (95\% CI 1.15-6.73);
   between 6 and 12 months the rate was 2.36 times greater (95\% CI
   1.18-4.73), whereas after 1 year the rate was 6.69 times greater (95\%
   CI 3.18-14.09).
   Conclusions: Our study highlights the need for programme implementers to
   take into account the specific challenges that may influence continuity
   of antiretroviral treatment and care for migrant populations.}},

Abstract = {{Many extracellular stimuli, e. g. microbial products, cytokines etc.,
   result in the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in

   gene in response to microbial products is a primary response of
   macrophages, or is the result of paracrine/autocrine signalling induced
   by endogenous biomolecules that are synthesised as a result of host
   cell-microbe interaction. In this paper we demonstrate that iNOS
   expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages in response to bacterial
   peptidoglycan (PGN) is a secondary effect requiring autocrine signalling
   of endogenously produced prostaglandin E2, and that PGN stimulation is
   mandatory, but not sufficient in itself, for induction of iNOS
   expression. (C) 2010 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Abstract = {{The redshifts and luminosities of type 1A supernovae are conventionally
   fitted with the current paradigm, which holds that the galaxies are
   locally stationary in an expanding metric. The fit fails unless the
   expansion is accelerating; driven perhaps by `dark energy'. Is the
   recession of the galaxies slowed down by gravity or speeded up by some
   repulsive force? To shed light on this question the redshifts and
   apparent magnitudes of type 1A supernovae are re-analysed in a cartesian
   frame of reference omitting gravitational effects. The redshift is
   ascribed to the relativistic Doppler effect which gives the recession
   velocity when the light was emitted; if this has not changed, the
   distance reached and the luminosity follow immediately. This simple
   concept fits the observations surprisingly well with the Hubble constant
   H(0) = 62.9 +/- 0.3 km s(-1) Mpc(-1). It appears that the galaxies
   recede at unchanging velocities, so on the largest scale there is no
   significant intergalactic force. Reasons for the apparent absence of an
   intergalactic force are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Ultraviolet (UV) light induces DNA-damage checkpoints and mutagenesis,
   which are involved in cancer protection and tumorigenesis, respectively.
   How cells identify DNA lesions and convert them to checkpoint-activating
   structures is a major question. We show that during repair of UV lesions
   in noncycling cells, Exo1-mediated processing of nucleotide excision
   repair (NER) intermediates competes with repair DNA synthesis.
   Impediments of the refilling reaction allow Exo1 to generate extended
   ssDNA gaps, detectable by electron microscopy, which drive Mec1 kinase
   activation and will be refilled by long-patch repair synthesis, as shown
   by DNA combing. We provide evidence that this mechanism may be
   stimulated by closely opposing UV lesions, represents a strategy to
   redirect problematic repair intermediates to alternative repair
   pathways, and may also be extended to physically different DNA damages.
   Our work has significant implications for understanding the coordination
   between repair of DNA lesions and checkpoint pathways to preserve genome
   stability.}},

Abstract = {{Neurodegenerative or autoimmune diseases are frequently regulated by
   chemokines and their receptors, controlling both glial activation and
   immune cell infiltration. CCL19 and CCL21 have been described to mediate
   crucial functions during CNS pathological states, regulating both immune
   cell traffic to the CNS and communication between glia and neurons.
   Here, we describe the expression pattern and cellular sources of CCR7,
   receptor of CCL19 and CCL21, in the normal mouse brain. Moreover, we
   found that CCR7 is upregulated in reactive astrocytes upon intracerebral
   LPS, regulating early glial reactivity through its ligands CCL19 and
   CCL21. Our results indicate that CCR7 is playing an important role for
   the intercellular communication during the inflammatory activation in
   the CNS. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Role of p75(NTR) in NMDAR-mediated excitotoxic brain injury in neonatal
   mice}},
Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1355}},
Pages = {{31-40}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Perinatal brain injury in preterm infants is a major cause
   of neurological handicap. The role of the neurotrophin receptor p75
   (p75(NTR)) in the pathogenesis and repair of neonatal excitotoxic brain
   injury is unknown. Depending on a complex interplay of neurotrophin
   signalling, p75(NTR) can, in addition to its trophic function, also
   induce apoptosis. Hypothesis: We hypothesised that excitotoxicity
   increases p75(NTR) expression and p75(NTR) knockout (KO) mice have a
   significantly smaller lesion size upon excitotoxicity as compared to
   wild-type (WT) mice. Methods: We used an established animal model of
   neonatal excitotoxic brain injury mimicking several key aspects of human
   preterm brain damage. We subjected five-day-old WT and KO mice to
   excitotoxic injury by means of a single intracranial ibotenate injection
   (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist, NMDAR) into one brain
   hemisphere. Lesion size, number of activated caspase-3- and
   apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)-positive cells were determined as
   outcome parameters. Gender analyses were taken into account
   retrospectively. Results: NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity induced an
   upregulation of p75(NTR) expression in the pen-lesion area. Lesion size
   was significantly increased in female KO as compared to male KO animals.
   Knockout of p75 reduced the number of activated caspase-3 but not
   AIF-positive cells after NMDAR-mediated excitotoxic injury independently
   of gender. Conclusion: Since NMDAR-mediated excitotoxic brain injury
   induced p75(NTR) expression and caspase-3-activated apoptosis in
   p75(NTR) KO animals was decreased, we conclude that activation of p75
   contributes to NMDAR-mediated apoptosis in the neonatal brain. An
   increase in lesion size in female animals after excitotoxic brain injury
   suggests that in females p75(NTR) seems to play a dual role. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Chitinases hydrolyze chitin, an insoluble linear polymer of
   N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG)(n), into nutrient sources. Bacillus cereus
   NCTU2 chitinase (ChiNCTU2) predominantly produces chitobioses and
   belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 18. The crystal structure of
   wild-type ChiNCTU2 comprises only a catalytic domain, unlike other
   chitinases that are equipped with additional chitin binding and
   insertion domains to bind substrates into the active site. Lacking
   chitin binding and chitin insertion domains, ChiNCTU2 utilizes two
   dynamic loops (Gly-67-Thr-69 and Ile-106-Val-112) to interact with
   (NAG)(n), generating novel substrate binding and distortion for
   catalysis. Gln-109 is crucial for direct binding with substrates,
   leading to conformational changes of two loops with a maximum shift of
   similar to 4.6 angstrom along the binding cleft. The structures of
   E145Q, E145Q/Y227F, and E145G/Y227F mutants complexed with (NAG)(n)
   reveal (NAG)(2), (NAG)(2), and (NAG)(4) in the active site,
   respectively, implying various stages of reaction: before hydrolysis,
   E145G/Y227F with (NAG)(4); in an intermediate state, E145Q/Y227F with a
   boat-form NAG at the -1 subsite, -1-(NAG); after hydrolysis, E145Q with
   a chair form -1-(NAG). Several residues were confirmed to play catalytic
   roles: Glu-145 in cleavage of the glycosidic bond between -1-(NAG) and
   -1-(NAG); Tyr-227 in the conformational change of -1-(NAG); Asp-143 and
   Gln-225 in stabilizing the conformation of -1-(NAG). Additionally,
   Glu-190 acts in the process of product release, and Tyr-193 coordinates
   with water for catalysis. Residues Asp-143, E145Q, Glu190, and Tyr-193
   exhibit multiple conformations for functions. The inhibitors zinc ions
   and cyclo-(L-His-L-Pro) are located at various positions and confirm the
   catalytic-site topology. Together with kinetics analyses of related
   mutants, the structures of ChiNCTU2 and its mutant complexes with
   (NAG)(n) provide new insights into its substrate binding and the
   mechanistic action.}},

Title = {{Predicting enzyme targets for cancer drugs by profiling human Metabolic
   reactions in NCI-60 cell lines}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Drugs can influence the whole metabolic system by targeting
   enzymes which catalyze metabolic reactions. The existence of
   interactions between drugs and metabolic reactions suggests a potential
   way to discover drug targets.
   Results: In this paper, we present a computational method to predict new
   targets for approved anti-cancer drugs by exploring drug-reaction
   interactions. We construct a Drug-Reaction Network to provide a global
   view of drug-reaction interactions and drug-pathway interactions. The
   recent reconstruction of the human metabolic network and development of
   flux analysis approaches make it possible to predict each metabolic
   reaction's cell line-specific flux state based on the cell line-specific
   gene expressions. We first profile each reaction by its flux states in
   NCI-60 cancer cell lines, and then propose a kernel k-nearest neighbor
   model to predict related metabolic reactions and enzyme targets for
   approved cancer drugs. We also integrate the target structure data with
   reaction flux profiles to predict drug targets and the area under curves
   can reach 0.92.
   Conclusions: The cross validations using the methods with and without
   metabolic network indicate that the former method is significantly
   better than the latter. Further experiments show the synergism of
   reaction flux profiles and target structure for drug target prediction.
   It also implies the significant contribution of metabolic network to
   predict drug targets. Finally, we apply our method to predict new
   reactions and possible enzyme targets for cancer drugs.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the prevalence and the clinical association of high
   titer of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (hGADAb) among
   unselected patients with inflammatory/autoimmune disorders of the
   nervous system. By indirect immunofluorescence examination of samples
   from 1435 patients, we identified 7 cases (0.48\%) with hGADAb. Although
   stiff-person plus syndrome was the commonest clinical accompaniment,
   most of the patients presented with a combination of different symptoms,
   including psychiatric disturbances and intestinal motility disorders.
   Diagnosis delay and chronic evolution were common findings. In two cases
   persistently high values of hGADAb over the years were observed. The
   rarity and the phenotype heterogeneity of hGADAb clinical association
   should not discourage clinicians from antibody screening, at least in
   selected cases, as an early immunotherapy can change the otherwise
   chronic progression of this complex disorder spectrum. (c) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We study the mechanics of nematically ordered semiflexible networks

   anisotropic networks exhibit a much more complex mechanical response
   characterized by a vanishing linear-response regime for highly ordered
   networks and a dependence of the shear modulus on shear direction at
   both small (linear) and finite (nonlinear) strains that is different
   from the affine prediction of orthotropic continuum linear elasticity.
   We show that these features can be understood in terms of a generalized
   floppy modes analysis of the nonaffine mechanics and a type of
   cooperative Euler buckling.}},

Title = {{Carbon nanotube oscillators for applications as nanothermometers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{40}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes have a broad range of potential
   applications such as nanomotors, nano-oscillators and electromechanical
   nanothermometers, and a proper understanding of the molecular
   interaction between nanostructures is fundamentally important for these
   applications. In this paper, we determine the molecular interaction
   potential of interacting carbon nanotubes for two configurations. The
   first is a shuttle configuration involving a short outer tube sliding on
   a fixed inner tube, and the second involves a telescopic configuration
   for which an inner tube moves both in the region between two outer tubes
   and through the tubes themselves. For the first configuration we examine
   two cases of semi-infinite and finite inner carbon nanotubes. We employ
   the continuum approximation and the 6-12 Lennard-Jones potential for
   non-bonded molecules to determine the molecular interaction potential
   and the resulting van der Waals force, and we evaluate the resulting
   surface integrals numerically. We also investigate the acceptance
   condition and suction energy for the first configuration. Our results
   show that for the shuttle configuration with a semi-infinite inner tube,
   the suction energy is maximum when the difference between the outer and
   inner tubes radii is approximately 3.4 angstrom, which is the ideal
   inter-wall spacing between graphene sheets. For the finite inner tube,
   the potential energy is dependent on both the inner and outer tube
   lengths as well as on the inter-wall spacing. In terms of the
   oscillating frequency, the critical issue is the length of the moving
   outer tube, and the shorter the length, the higher the frequency.
   Further, for the telescopic configuration with two semi-infinite outer
   nanotubes of different radii, we find that the interaction energy also
   depends on the difference of the tube radii. For two outer nanotubes of
   equal radii we observe that the shorter the distance between the two
   outer nanotubes, the higher the magnitude of the interaction potential
   around the origin.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Brugada syndrome (BS) is associated with an increased risk
   of sudden cardiac death (SCD) caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmia.
   Thus, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) became the main
   therapeutic option in these patients. We aimed to investigate the
   prevalence of BS in the Eastern Alps as well as the benefit of ICD
   therapy in this collective.
   Methods: During physical examination before military service, 47,606
   Austrian men were screened for Brugada ECG pattern. Furthermore, we
   followed 4491 patients with arrhythmia during the last two decades, of
   which 26 patients (20 male; age at diagnosis: 43.2 +/- 11.6 years)
   revealed BS. Diagnosis was based on characteristic ECG either at rest
   (11 patients) or after provocation with Ajmaline (15 patients).
   Results: The nationwide screening revealed one individual with Brugada
   ECG (prevalence of 2.10/100,000 inhabitants). Prior to diagnosis of BS,
   syncope and SCD survival were observed in 7 and 4 patients,
   respectively; the remaining 15 patients were asymptomatic. ICD were
   implanted in 17 patients (15 male). Three asymptomatic patients received
   no ICD because no tachyarrhythmia was inducible on programmed
   stimulation. Six asymptomatic patients without family history of sudden
   death refused further evaluation. Mean ICD follow-up period was 57.0 +/-
   32.2 months. Two patients (11.7\%) needed defibrillation therapy. Four
   patients (23.5\%) received exclusively inappropriate shocks (three due
   to T-wave oversensing, one due to atrial fibrillation).
   Conclusions: Brugada syndrome has a low prevalence in the Eastern alpine
   region. Patients with BS benefit from ICD implantation, but less
   frequently than anticipated. The problem of inappropriate ICD discharges
   is still of major concern. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We have previously reported that obesity-induced diabetes developed in
   high-fat diet (HFD)-fed BDF1 mice. This is caused by insufficient
   insulin response to an excess glucose load. In this study, we have shown
   that the enhanced expression of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 3 (Raldh3)
   causes functional disorders of pancreatic islets in diabetic mouse
   models. In the pancreatic islets of HFD-induced diabetic BDF1 mice and
   spontaneously diabetic C57BL/KsJ(db/db) mice, gene expression analysis
   with oligonucleotide microarray revealed a significant increase in
   Raldh3 expression. Exposure to a culture medium containing a higher
   glucose concentration (25 mM) significantly increased Raldh3 expression
   in murine MIN6 and alphaTC1 clone 9 cells, which derived from the alpha
   and beta-cells of pancreatic islets, respectively. Overexpression of
   Raldh3 reduced the insulin secretion in MIN6 cells, and surprisingly,
   increased the glucagon secretion in alphaTC1 clone 9 cells. Furthermore,
   the knockdown of Raldh3 expression with siRNA decreased the glucagon
   secretion in alphaTC1 clone 9 cells. Raldh3 catalyzes the conversion of
   13-cis retinal to 13-cis retinoic acid and we revealed that 13-cis
   retinoic acid significantly reduces cell viability in MIN6 and alphaTC1
   clone 9 cells, but not in cells of H4IIEC3, 3T3-L1, and COS-1 cell
   lines. These findings suggest that an increasing expression of Raldh3
   deregulates the balanced mechanisms of insulin and glucagon secretion in
   the pancreatic islets and may induce beta-cell dysfunction leading to
   the development of type 2 diabetes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Genome profiling of ERBB2-amplified breast cancers}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Around 20\% of breast cancers (BC) show ERBB2 gene
   amplification and overexpression of the ERBB2 tyrosine kinase receptor.
   They are associated with a poor prognosis but can benefit from targeted
   therapy. A better knowledge of these BCs, genomically and biologically
   heterogeneous, may help understand their behavior and design new
   therapeutic strategies.
   Methods: We defined the high resolution genome and gene expression
   profiles of 54 ERBB2-amplified BCs using 244K oligonucleotide
   array-comparative genomic hybridization and whole-genome DNA
   microarrays. Expression of ERBB2, phosphorylated ERBB2, EGFR, IGF1R and
   FOXA1 proteins was assessed by immunohistochemistry to evaluate the
   functional ERBB2 status and identify co-expressions.
   Results: First, we identified the ERBB2-C17orf37-GRB7 genomic segment as
   the minimal common 17q12-q21 amplicon, and CRKRS and IKZF3 as the most
   frequent centromeric and telomeric amplicon borders, respectively.
   Second, GISTIC analysis identified 17 other genome regions affected by
   copy number aberration (CNA) (amplifications, gains, losses). The
   expression of 37 genes of these regions was deregulated. Third, two
   types of heterogeneity were observed in ERBB2-amplified BCs. The genomic
   profiles of estrogen receptor-postive (ER+) and negative (ER-)
   ERBB2-amplified BCs were different. The WNT/beta-catenin signaling
   pathway was involved in ER-ERBB2-amplified BCs, and PVT1 and TRPS1 were
   candidate oncogenes associated with ER+ ERBB2-amplified BCs. The size of
   the ERBB2 amplicon was different in inflammatory (IBC) and
   non-inflammatory BCs. ERBB2-amplified IBCs were characterized by the
   downregulated and upregulated mRNA expression of ten and two genes in
   proportion to CNA, respectively. IHC results showed (i) a linear
   relationship between ERBB2 gene amplification and its gene and protein
   expressions with a good correlation between ERBB2 expression and
   phosphorylation status; (ii) a potential signaling cross-talk between
   EGFR or IGF1R and ERBB2, which could influence response of
   ERBB2-positive BCs to inhibitors. FOXA1 was frequently coexpressed with
   ERBB2 but its expression did not impact on the outcome of patients with
   ERBB2-amplified tumors.
   Conclusion: We have shown that ER+ and ER-ERBB2-amplified BCs are
   different, distinguished ERBB2 amplicons in IBC and non-IBC, and
   identified genomic features that may be useful in the design of
   alternative therapeutical strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The coupling between the boundary element method (BEM)/the traction
   boundary element method (TBEM) and the method of fundamental solutions
   (MFS) is proposed for the transient analysis of conduction heat transfer
   in the presence of inclusions, thereby overcoming the limitations posed
   by each method. The full domain is divided into sub-domains, which are
   modeled using the BEM/TBEM and the MES, and the coupling of the
   sub-domains is achieved by imposing the required boundary conditions.
   The accuracy of the proposed algorithms, using different combinations of
   BEM/TBEM and MFS formulations, is checked by comparing the resulting
   solutions against referenced solutions.
   The applicability of the proposed methodology is shown by simulating the
   thermal behavior of a solid ring incorporating a crack or a thin
   inclusion in its wall. The crack is assumed to have null thickness and
   does not allow diffusion of energy; hence, the heat fluxes are null
   along its boundary. The thin inclusion is modeled as filled with thermal
   insulating material. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, effect of sample geometry on the mechanical properties of

   truncated conical samples with different semi-vertex angles (alpha) were
   prepared for quasistatic compression test. It was noticed that as the
   geometry of the sample was slightly deviated from a cylindrical shape
   (for which alpha = 0 degrees) to a conical shape (for which alpha > 0
   degrees), stress gradients were induced in the conical samples which
   were estimated using finite element analysis. This led to the formation
   of a large amount of intersecting multiple shear bands. As a result,
   as-cast BMG sample with negligible plasticity tends to deform in a
   ductile manner. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Here we show how the electromechanical properties of silicon nanowires
   (NWs) are modified when they are subjected to extreme mechanical
   deformations (buckling and buckling mode transitions), such as those
   appearing in flexible devices. Flexible devices are prone to frequent
   dynamic stress variations, especially buckling, while the small size of
   NWs could give them an advantage as ultra-sensitive electromechanical
   stress sensors embedded in such devices. We evaluated the NWs
   post-buckling behavior and the effects of buckling mode transition on
   their piezoresistive gauge factor (GF). Polycrystalline silicon NWs were
   embedded in SiO2 microbridges to facilitate concurrent monitoring of
   their electrical resistance without problematic interference, while an
   external stylus performed controlled deformations of the microbridges.
   At points of instability, the abrupt change in the buckling
   configuration of the microbridge corresponded to a sharp resistance
   change in the embedded NWs, without altering the NWs' GF. These results
   also highlight the importance of strategically positioning the NW in the
   devices, since electrical monitoring of buckling mode transitions is
   feasible when the deformations impact a region where the NW is placed.
   The highly flexible NWs also exhibited unusually large fracture
   strength, sustaining tensile strains up to 5.6\%; this will prove
   valuable in demanding flexible sensors.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Highly ordered TiO2 nanotubular arrays have been prepared by two-step
   anodization under high field. The high anodizing current densities lead
   to a high-speed film growth (0.40-1.00 mu m min(-1)), which is nearly 16
   times faster than traditional fabrication of TiO2 at low field. It was
   found that an annealing process of Ti foil is an effective approach to
   get a monodisperse and double-pass TiO2 nanotubular layer with a
   gradient pore diameter and ultrathin tube wall (nearly 10 nm). A higher
   anodic voltage and longer anodization time are beneficial to the
   formation of ultrathin tube walls. This approach is simple and
   cost-effective in fabricating high-quality ordered TiO2 nanotubular
   arrays for practical applications.}},

Title = {{Stranger to Familiar: Wild Strepsirhines Manage Xenophobia by Playing}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{The power of play in limiting xenophobia is a well-known phenomenon in
   humans. Yet, the evidence in social animals remains meager. Here, we aim
   to determine whether play promotes social tolerance toward strangers in
   one of the most basal group of primates, the strepsirhines. We observed
   two groups of wild lemurs (Propithecus verreauxi, Verreaux's sifaka)
   during the mating season. Data were also collected on nine visiting,
   outgroup males. We compared the distribution of play, grooming, and
   aggressive interactions across three conditions: OUT (resident/outgroup
   interactions), IN (resident/resident interactions in presence of
   outgroups) and BL-IN (baseline of resident/resident interactions in
   absence of outgroups). Play frequency between males was higher in OUT
   than in IN and BL-IN conditions; whereas, grooming was more frequent in
   IN than in OUT and BL-IN conditions. Aggression rates between resident
   and outgroup males were significantly higher than those between
   residents. However, aggressions between resident and outgroup males
   significantly decreased after the first play session and became
   comparable with resident-resident aggression levels. The presence of
   strangers in a well-established group implies the onset of novel social
   circumstances, which sifaka males cope with by two different tactics:
   grooming with ingroup males and playing with outgroup ones. The grooming
   peak, concurrently with the visit of outgroups, probably represents a
   social shield adopted by resident males to make their pre-existing
   affiliation more evident to the stranger ``audience''. Being mostly
   restricted to unfamiliar males, adult play in sifaka appears to have a
   role in managing new social situations more than in maintaining old
   relationships. In particular, our results indicate not only that play is
   the interface between strangers but also that it has a specific function
   in reducing xenophobia. In conclusion, play appears to be an ice-breaker
   mechanism in the critical process that ``upgrades'' an individual from
   stranger to familiar.}},

Abstract = {{Spermiogenesis represents the process through which haploid male germ
   cells differentiate from round spermatids into elongated spermatids and
   eventually the male gametes called spermatozoa. Haploid cell
   differentiation is unique to male germ cell development and many unique
   genes/proteins essential for this process have been discovered. SPEM1 is
   one of these spermiogenesis-essential proteins encoded by a
   testis-specific gene exclusively expressed in the developing spermatids
   Inactivation of Spem1 in mice results in deformed spermatozoa
   characterized by ``head-bent-back{''} abnormalities with 100\%
   penetrance Using yeast two-hybrid screening assays, we identified UBQLN1
   as one of the SPEM1-interacting partners. UBQLN1 and SPEM1 were
   colocalized to the manchette of elongating spermatids Since UBQLN1
   functions through binding and directing poly-ubiquitinated proteins to
   the proteasome for degradation, interactions between UBQLN1 and SPEM1
   suggest a role in the regulation of protein ubiquitination during
   spermiogenesis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Benign stricture is a relatively common complication of colorectal
   anastomosis after low anterior resection. On occasion, the anastornosis
   may close completely. A variety of endoscopic techniques have been
   described, but there is a lack of data from controlled prospective
   trials as to the optimal approach. Through-the-scope balloon dilatation
   is well known and easy to perform. Some case reports describe different
   endoscopic approaches, including endoscopic electrocision with a
   papillotomy knife or hook knife. We report a case of a colorectal
   anastomosis web occlusion, treated without electrocision. Gastrografin
   enema and sigmoidoscopy showed complete obstruction at the anastomotic
   site due to the presence of an anastomotic occlusive web. In order to
   avoid thermal injuries, we decided to use a suprapapillary binary
   puncture catheter. The Artifon catheter was inserted into the center of
   the circular staple line at the level of the anastomosis, and
   fluoroscopic identification of the proximal bowel was obtained with dye
   injection. A 0.025-inch guidewire was then passed through the catheter
   into the colon and progressive pneumatic dilatation was performed. The
   successful destruction of the occlusive web facilitated passage of the
   colonoscope, allowing evaluation of the entire colon and stoma closure
   after three months of follow-up. The patient tolerated the procedure
   well, with no complications. This report highlights an alternative
   non-electrosurgical approach that uses a new device that proved to be
   safe and useful. (C) 2010 Baishideng. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Surface Covering of Downed Logs: Drivers of a Neglected Process in Dead
   Wood Ecology}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Many species use coarse woody debris (CWD) and are disadvantaged by the
   forestry-induced loss of this resource. A neglected process affecting
   CWD is the covering of the surfaces of downed logs caused by sinking
   into the ground (increasing soil contact, mostly covering the underside
   of the log), and dense overgrowth by ground vegetation. Such cover is
   likely to profoundly influence the quality and accessibility of CWD for
   wood-inhabiting organisms, but the factors affecting covering are
   largely unknown. In a five-year experiment we determined predictors of
   covering rate of fresh logs in boreal forests and clear-cuts. Logs with
   branches were little covered because they had low longitudinal ground
   contact. For branchless logs, longitudinal ground contact was most
   strongly related to estimated peat depth (positive relation). The
   strongest predictor for total cover of branchless logs was longitudinal
   ground contact. To evaluate the effect on cover of factors other than
   longitudinal ground contact, we separately analyzed data from only those
   log sections that were in contact with the ground. Four factors were
   prominent predictors of percentage cover of such log sections: estimated
   peat depth, canopy shade (both increasing cover), potential solar
   radiation calculated from slope and slope aspect, and diameter of the
   log (both reducing cover). Peat increased cover directly through its low
   resistance, which allowed logs to sink and soil contact to increase.
   High moisture and low temperatures in pole-ward facing slopes and under
   a canopy favor peat formation through lowered decomposition and enhanced
   growth of peat-forming mosses, which also proved to rapidly overgrow
   logs. We found that in some boreal forests, peat and fast-growing mosses
   can rapidly cover logs lying on the ground. When actively introducing
   CWD for conservation purposes, we recommend that such rapid covering is
   avoided, thereby most likely improving the CWD's longevity as habitat
   for many species.}},

Title = {{Physical atmospheric structure and tropospheric mixing information in
   vertical profiles of atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Vertical distribution of atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios, as well as CO2
   vertical variance and gradient are related to the vertical stability at
   the time of measurement, to the transport of coherent upstream plumes
   studied through changes in the upstream surface influence or to the
   historic mixing processes and dispersive behavior. Three vertical
   profiles of CO2 mixing ratios measured from 900 to 4200 m above sea
   level (masl) in 2006 at La Muela, Spain (LMU, 41.60 degrees N 1.10
   degrees W, 570 masl) are examined. Changes in CO2 mixing ratio are
   associated with changes of the atmospheric physical parameters on the
   day of the survey; and with the transport of coherent air masses. Its
   consistency is examined through changes of the historical horizontal
   dispersion and chaotic mixing dynamics of air masses during the four
   days prior to measurements. A climatology of Lagrangian backward
   simulations run once a week at four altitudes (600, 1200, 2500 and 4000
   masl) at LMU for 2006 shows that dispersion in these altitudes is
   superdiffusive (exponent coefficient gamma > 1/2) and mixing follows a
   chaotic dynamics (power law exponent lambda > 0) at all altitudes and in
   all seasons. Furthermore, a Horizontal Mixing Discontinuity (HMD) at
   similar to 2500 masl separates two layers with different constraints on
   vertical mixing. Above the HMD, more coherent air masses and laminar
   transport characterizes the dynamics of atmospheric horizontal mixing
   whereas below it, filamentation and chaotic mixing dominate horizontal
   mixing. In the lower part of the vertical profile, within the ABL,
   mixing takes place by convection. Chaotic mixing below the HMD induces
   the boundary layer entrainment. Results highlight that there are two
   main discontinuities in the air column which separates different
   atmospheric dynamics. The ABL is driven by local meteorological
   conditions of the site at the sampling time; the HMD is driven by the
   synoptic-scale historical mixing conditions of air masses. The effect of
   horizontal transport in the free troposphere should be considered
   equally as important as the local vertical mixing processes in the
   atmospheric boundary layer when interpreting CO2 vertical gradients. The
   dispersive exponents can be used to identify the transport of coherent
   plumes from anthropogenic emissions with different carbon composition
   that the one-single backtrajectories models do not detect.}},

   predicts the measured lowering of the free energy of activation across a

   consistent with the established structural origin of the S(N)2

Abstract = {{AIM: To investigate the accuracy of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
   in diagnosing lamivudine resistance and factors that contributed to
   abnormal serum ALT.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective study of chronic hepatitis B patients
   on lamivudine therapy who were followed for 3-mo with liver function
   tests and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA measurement. Lamivudine resistance
   was defined as HBV DNA >= 1 log from nadir on at least 2 occasions,
   confirmed by genotyping. Serum ALT levels in patients with lamivudine
   resistance were compared to serum ALT levels in those without lamivudine
   resistance.
   RESULTS: There were 111 patients with and 117 without lamivudine
   resistance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic of
   serum ALT to diagnose lamivudine resistance was 0.645 +/- 0.037. Serum
   ALT 42.5 U/L gave the best diagnostic accuracy with sensitivity = 61\%,
   specificity = 60\%, positive predictive value = 60\%, negative
   predictive value = 61\%, positive likelihood ratio = 1.53 and negative
   likelihood ratio = 0.65 for predicting lamivudine resistance, missing
   39\% of resistant patients. Using other serum ALT cutoffs, diagnostic
   accuracy was lower. By multivariate analysis, baseline abnormal serum
   ALT was associated with abnormal ALT during resistance (OR = 5.98, P =
   0.003), and males were associated with serum ALT flares during
   resistance (OR = 8.9, P = 0.016).
   CONCLUSION: Serum ALT is inadequate for diagnosing lamivudine resistance
   and has implications where viral resistance testing is suboptimal and
   for reimbursement of rescue therapy. (C) 2010 Baishideng. All rights

Abstract = {{We conducted studies in Vanuatu to evaluate potential screening and
   treatment strategies to assist with control of cervical cancer. In a
   pilot study of 496 women, visual inspection and cytology were evaluated
   as screening tests for detection of CIN 2 or worse (CIN2+), observed in
   21 of 206 subjects biopsied on the basis of abnormal visual inspection
   or cytology. Sensitivity of visual inspection with Lugol's Iodine for
   detection of CIN2+ on biopsy was 0.63, specificity was 0.32, and the
   positive predictive value was 0.09. For HSIL cytology, sensitivity was
   0.99, specificity was 0.77, and the positive predictive value was 0.88.
   HSIL cytology was significantly more sensitive and had a significantly
   higher PPV for CIN 2+ than visual inspection (p<0.01). In a further
   study of 514 women, we compared testing for HR HPV and cytology as
   predictors of biopsy proven CIN 2+. Sensitivity of HSIL cytology for
   CIN2+ as established by loop excision of the cervix was 0.81,
   specificity was 0.94, and positive predictive value was 0.48.
   Sensitivity of a positive test for HR HPV for detection of CIN2+ was
   non-significantly different from cytology at 0.81, specificity was 0.94,
   and positive predictive value was 0.42. Combining the two tests gave a
   significantly lower sensitivity of 0.63, a specificity of 0.98, and a
   positive predictive value of 0.68. For women over 30 in a low resource
   setting without access to cytology, a single locally conduced test for
   high risk HPV with effective intervention could reduce cervical cancer
   risk as effectively as intervention based on cytology conducted in an

Abstract = {{The oxidative degradation of insecticide metomyl as active ingredient
   and of its commercial formulation Lanate 20 L by an electro-Fenton
   process using a carbon felt cathode and iron ions as catalyst was
   compared with different transition metal ions such as, cobalt, silver,
   and copper as catalyst to produce hydroxyl radicals. The effect of
   catalyst nature and concentration on the degradation kinetics and COD
   removal was investigated and optimized. For all metal ions under study
   as catalyst, there is an optimal concentration value for degradation
   kinetics and solution COD removal efficiency. Fe(III) was confirmed to
   be the most efficient catalyst among the metals ions tested. The metomyl
   oxidative degradation was found to obey apparent first-order reaction
   kinetics, and the absolute rate constant of the oxidation between
   metomyl and hydroxyl radicals at pH 3.0 was obtained by competitive
   kinetics method, being 5.42 x 10(9) L mol(-1) s(-1).}},

Title = {{Phylometrics: a pipeline for inferring phylogenetic trees from a

Abstract = {{Background: Comparative sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene is
   frequently used to characterize the microbial diversity of environmental
   samples. However, sequence similarities do not always imply functional
   or evolutionary relatedness due to many factors, including unequal rates
   of change and convergence. Thus, relying on top BLASTN hits for
   phylogenetic studies may misrepresent the diversity of these
   constituents. Furthermore, attempts to circumvent this issue by
   including a large number of BLASTN hits per sequence in one tree to
   explore their relatedness presents other problems. For instance, the
   multiple sequence alignment will be poor and computationally costly if
   not relying on manual alignment, and it may be difficult to derive
   meaningful relationships from the resulting tree. Analyzing sequence
   relationship networks within collective BLASTN results, however, reveal
   sequences that are closely related despite low rank.
   Results: We have developed a web application, Phylometrics, that relies
   on networks of collective BLASTN results (rather than single BLASTN
   hits) to facilitate the process of building phylogenetic trees in an
   automated, high-throughput fashion while offering novel tools to find
   sequences that are of significant phylogenetic interest with minimal
   human involvement. The application, which can be installed locally in a
   laboratory or hosted remotely, utilizes a simple wizard-style format to
   guide the user through the pipeline without necessitating a background
   in programming. Furthermore, Phylometrics implements an independent job
   queuing system that enables users to continue to use the system while
   jobs are run with little or no degradation in performance.
   Conclusions: Phylometrics provides a novel data mining method to screen
   supplied DNA sequences and to identify sequences that are of significant
   phylogenetic interest using powerful analytical tools. Sequences that
   are identified as being similar to a number of supplied sequences may
   provide key insights into their functional or evolutionary relatedness.
   Users require the same basic computer skills as for navigating most
   internet applications.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Quantum walks are the quantum-mechanical analog of random walks, in
   which a quantum ``walker{''} evolves between initial and final states by
   traversing the edges of a graph, either in discrete steps from node to
   node or via continuous evolution under the Hamiltonian furnished by the
   adjacency matrix of the graph. We present a hybrid scheme for universal
   quantum computation in which a quantum walker takes discrete steps of
   continuous evolution. This ``discontinuous{''} quantum walk employs
   perfect quantum-state transfer between two nodes of specific subgraphs
   chosen to implement a universal gate set, thereby ensuring unitary
   evolution without requiring the introduction of an ancillary coin space.
   The run time is linear in the number of simulated qubits and gates. The
   scheme allows multiple runs of the algorithm to be executed almost
   simultaneously by starting walkers one time step apart.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its use in a wide variety of industrially important
   thermochemical processes, little is known about the thermal
   decomposition mechanism of dimethyl disulfide (DMDS). To obtain more
   insight, the radical decomposition mechanism of DMDS is studied
   theoretically and a kinetic model is developed accounting for the
   formation of all the decomposition products observed in the experimental
   studies available in literature. Thermochemical data and rate
   coefficients are obtained using the high-level CBS-QB3 composite method.
   Among five methods tested (BMK/6-311G(2d,d,p), MPW1PW91/6-311G(2d,d,p),
   G3, G3B3, and CBS-QB3), the CBS-QB3 method was found to reproduce most
   accurately the experimental standard enthalpies of formation for a set
   of 17 small organosulfur compounds and the bond dissociation energies
   for a set of 10 sulfur bonds. Enthalpies of formation were predicted
   within 4 kJ mol(-1) while the mean absolute deviation on the bond
   dissociation enthalpies amounts to 7 kJ mol(-1). From the theoretical
   study, a new reaction path is identified for the formation of carbon
   disulfide via dithiirane (CH(2)S(2)). A reaction mechanism was
   constructed containing 36 reactions among 25 species accounting for the
   formation of all the decomposition products reported in literature.
   High-pressure limit rate coefficients for the 36 reactions in the
   reaction mechanism are presented. The kinetic model is able to grasp the
   experimental observations. With the recombination of thiyl radicals
   treated as being in the low-pressure limit, the experimentally reported
   first-order rate coefficients for the decomposition of DMDS are
   reproduced within 1 order of magnitude, while the observed product
   selectivities of most compounds are reproduced satisfactory. Simulations
   indicate that at high conversions most of the carbon disulfide forms
   according to the newly identified reaction path involving the formation
   of dithiirane.}},

   convection}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of idealized moist
   turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection are presented. The thermodynamics
   of moist air is linearized close to the phase boundary between water
   vapor and liquid water. This formulation allows for a simplified
   saturation condition for the cloud formation, but omits supersaturation
   and rain. The sensitivity of this problem to changes of the Rayleigh
   number, the aspect ratio of the convection layer and the water vapor
   concentration is studied. The Rayleigh number is found to impact the
   behavior of the system in multiple ways. First, the relaxation time
   toward a well-mixed turbulent state increases with the Rayleigh number.
   Similarly, the flow exhibits a higher spatial and temporal intermittency
   at higher Rayleigh number. This is in line with an enhanced
   intermittency of the upward buoyancy flux, which we quantify by a
   multifractal analysis. In addition, phase transition introduces an
   asymmetry in the distribution of the thermodynamic properties of the
   well-mixed state. This asymmetry is most pronounced in layers where
   clouds are partially present. Furthermore, the geometrical properties of
   the cloud formations averaged with respect to the height of the layer
   are studied. Similar to isocontours in scalar mixing, the boundaries of
   isolated clouds show no strict (mono-)fractal behavior. The results of
   the perimeter-area analysis of the largest isolated clouds agree well
   with those of large eddy simulations of cumulus convection. This
   perimeter-area scaling is also similar to that of percolation processes
   in a plane.}},

Title = {{Aberrant host immune response induced by highly virulent PRRSV
   identified by digital gene expression tag profiling}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: There was a large scale outbreak of the highly pathogenic
   porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in China and
   Vietnam during 2006 and 2007 that resulted in unusually high morbidity
   and mortality among pigs of all ages. The mechanisms underlying the
   molecular pathogenesis of the highly virulent PRRS virus (H-PRRSV)
   remains unknown. Therefore, the relationship between pulmonary gene
   expression profiles after H-PRRSV infection and infection pathology were
   analyzed in this study using high-throughput deep sequencing and
   histopathology.
   Results: H-PRRSV infection resulted in severe lung pathology. The
   results indicate that aberrant host innate immune responses to H-PRRSV
   and induction of an anti-apoptotic state could be responsible for the
   aggressive replication and dissemination of H-PRRSV. Prolific rapid
   replication of H-PRRSV could have triggered aberrant sustained
   expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines leading to a
   markedly robust inflammatory response compounded by significant cell
   death and increased oxidative damage. The end result was severe tissue
   damage and high pathogenicity.
   Conclusions: The systems analysis utilized in this study provides a
   comprehensive basis for better understanding the pathogenesis of
   H-PRRSV. Furthermore, it allows the genetic components involved in
   H-PRRSV resistance/susceptibility in swine populations to be identified.}},

Title = {{Structure, energy, and electronic states of vacancies in Ge nanocrystals}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{The atomic structure, energy of formation, and electronic states of
   vacancies in H-passivated Ge nanocrystals are studied by
   density-functional theory methods. The competition between quantum
   self-purification and the free surface relaxations is investigated. The
   free surfaces of crystals smaller than 2 nm distort the Jahn-Teller
   relaxation and enhance the reconstruction bonds. This increases the
   energy splitting of the quantum states and reduces the energy of
   formation to as low as 1 eV per defect in the smallest nanocrystals. In
   crystals larger than 2 nm the observed symmetry of the Jahn-Teller
   distortion matches the symmetry expected for bulk Ge crystals. Near the
   nanocrystal's surface the vacancy is found to have an energy of
   formation no larger than 0.5-1.4 eV per defect, but a vacancy more than
   0.7 nm inside the surface has an energy of formation that is the same as
   in bulk Ge. No evidence of the self-purification effect is observed; the
   dominant effect is the free surface relaxations, which allow for the
   enhanced reconstruction. From the evidence in this paper, it is
   predicted that for moderate sized Ge nanocrystals a vacancy inside the
   crystal will behave bulklike and not interact strongly with the surface,
   except when it is within 0.7 nm of the surface.}},

Abstract = {{Although cellular copper metabolism is tightly regulated through a
   variety of copper transport proteins and chaperones, disturbances in
   copper homeostasis are involved in several pathological disorders. The
   aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of extremely low copper
   concentrations on gene expression profiles of a line of human prostate
   epithelial cells (RWPE) which grows in the absence of fetal calf serum,
   a source of variable and unpredictable copper. Cells were exposed to
   copper(II) sulfate for 24 h at concentrations varying from 10(-6) to
   10(-17) M and untreated reference cells were exposed to the same volume
   of copper-free water. Relative gene expression variations between
   copper-treated and control cells were studied with microarray technology
   using the Whole Human Genome Array from Agilent. Microarray data
   demonstrated that copper added to the medium varied gene expression at
   all concentrations tested. Many genes belonging to functional gene
   families were modulated by copper, some dose-dependently. Amongst these
   genes metallothioneins (MT1A and MT2A) were over-expressed at all copper
   concentrations, MT1M was up-regulated between 10(-6) and 10(-9) M, while
   MT1B, MT1E, MT1G and MT1H were up-regulated between 10(-6) and 10(-14)
   M. The heat shock protein (HSP) gene family showed similar behavior:
   some HSP genes were constantly up-regulated by copper (HSP90Ad. HSP90B1
   and HSPD1) and others only at higher concentrations (HSP90AB1 and
   HSPA8). Reverse-transcription-PCR analysis, performed on four different
   genes on five biological replicates for selected genes, on each copper
   concentration tested, confirmed the trend observed in microarray
   results. In conclusion, we unexpectedly observed a modulation of gene
   expression even at extremely diluted copper concentrations, similar to
   that induced by toxic concentrations, possibly as a result of very tight
   control of free copper(II) levels inside the cells. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Methylamine adsorption on the ordered Ni3Al(111) and NiAl(110) surfaces
   has been investigated by high resolution photoelectron spectroscopy and
   density functional theory calculations. Methylamine adsorbs molecularly
   at both surfaces at low temperature (90 K). The experiments show that
   methylamine interacts with the surface aluminium atoms on both surfaces,
   resulting in a positive binding energy shift relative to the Al 2p bulk
   contributions. A shift towards lower binding energy is also observed on
   NiAl(110) attributed to first and second layer surface Al atoms not
   bonded to methylamine. According to total energy calculations
   methylamine binds through its N atom to Al on-top sites on NiAl(110)
   while the Ni on-top site is found to be slightly preferred over the Al
   on-top site on Ni3Al(111). Calculated adsorbate induced shifts are,
   however, in good agreement with the experimental values only when
   methylamine is situated in the Al on-top site on both surfaces. In both
   cases, a lone pair bonding mechanism is found.}},

Abstract = {{Despite major successes of biophysical theories in predicting the
   effects of electrical shocks within the heart, recent optical mapping
   studies have revealed two major discrepancies between theory and
   experiment: 1), the presence of negative bulk polarization recorded
   during strong shocks; and 2), the unexpectedly small surface
   polarization under shock electrodes. There is little consensus as to
   whether these differences result from deficiencies of experimental
   techniques, artifacts of tissue damage, or deficiencies of existing
   theories. Here, we take advantage of recently developed near-infrared
   voltage-sensitive dyes and transillumination optical imaging to perform,
   for the first time that we know of, noninvasive probing of field effects
   deep inside the intact ventricular wall. This technique removes some of
   the limitations encountered in previous experimental studies. We
   explicitly demonstrate that deep inside intact myocardial tissue
   preparations, strong electrical shocks do produce considerable negative
   bulk polarization previously inferred from surface recordings. We also
   demonstrate that near-threshold diastolic field stimulation produces
   activation of deep myocardial layers 2-6 mm away from the cathodal
   surface, contrary to theory. Using bidomain simulations we explore
   factors that may improve the agreement between theory and experiment. We
   show that the inclusion of negative asymmetric current can qualitatively
   explain negative bulk polarization in a discontinuous bidomain model.}},

Abstract = {{Supercritical dissolved-gas atomization is an atomization process in
   which carbon dioxide at temperature and pressure above its critical
   point is used as the atomizing gas. The spray characteristics in terms
   of droplets size and distribution have been experimentally studied using
   a laser diffraction method based on a Malvern apparatus. The main
   parameter that influences the droplets size is the gas-to-liquid mass
   ratio (GLR); the injection pressure in the range of 7.4-13 MPa has a
   minor effect. Upon variation of the GLR from 0.5 to 3, the droplet mean
   diameter changes from about 8.0 to 2.0 mu m; very narrow droplet size
   distributions are also produced. From the point of view of the
   atomization mechanism, the mean droplet diameter is mainly influenced by
   the sudden release of the gas dissolved in the liquid. The overall
   analysis of the experimental data confirms that dissolved-gas
   atomization allows for the formation of micrometric droplets that can
   produce precipitates with controlled sizes and distributions that are
   useful in several fine-particles production processes.}},

   nitrene fragment to the IMesM+ moiety by energy-resolved
   collision-induced dissociation experiments in the gas phase, affording a
   trend in bond strength of M = Cu approximate to Au > Ag. This trend is
   explained in terms of a detailed metal-nitrogen bonding analysis, from
   which relativistic effects on the bonding were assessed. Various density
   functionals were evaluated for reproducing the observed thermochemical
   data and Truhlar's M06 functional was found to give the best agreement.}},

Abstract = {{We report the self-seeded growth of highly crystalline Ge nanowires,
   with a mean diameter as small as 6 nm without the need for a metal
   catalyst. The nanowires, synthesized using the purpose-built precursor
   hexakis(trimethylsilyl)digermane, exhibit high aspect ratios (>1000)
   while maintaining a uniform core diameter along their length.
   Additionally, the nanowires are encased in an amorphous shell of
   material derived from the precursor, which acts to passivate their
   surfaces and isolates the Ge seed particles from which the nanowires
   grow. The diameter of the nanowires was found to depend on the synthesis
   temperature employed. Specifically, there is a linear relationship
   between the inverse radius of the nanowires and the synthesis
   temperature, which can be explained by a model for the size-dependent
   melting of simple metals.}},

Abstract = {{A water oxidation catalyst generated via electrodeposition from aqueous
   solutions containing phosphate and Co2+ (Co-Pi) has been studied by in
   situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Spectra were obtained for Co-Pi
   films of two different thicknesses at an applied potential supporting
   water oxidation catalysis and at open circuit. Extended X-ray absorption
   fine structure (EXAFS) spectra indicate the presence of
   bis-oxo/hydroxo-bridged Co subunits incorporated into higher nuclearity
   clusters in Co-Pi. The average cluster nuclearity is greater in a
   relatively thick film (similar to 40-50 nmol Co ions/cm(2)) deposited at
   1.25 V vs NHE than in an extremely thin film (similar to 3 nmol Co
   ions/cm(2)) deposited at 1.1 V. X-ray absorption near edge structure
   (XANES) spectra and electrochemical data support a Co valency greater
   than 3 for both Co-Pi samples when catalyzing water oxidation at 1.25 V.
   Upon switching to open circuit, Co-Pi undergoes a continuous reduction
   due to residual water oxidation catalysis, as indicated by the negative
   shift of the edge energy. The rate of reduction depends on the average
   cluster size. On the basis of structural parameters extracted from fits
   to the EXAFS data of Co-Pi with two different thicknesses and
   comparisons with EXAFS spectra of Co oxide compounds, a model is
   proposed wherein the Co oxo/hydroxo clusters of Co-Pi are composed of
   edge-sharing CoO6 octahedra, the structural motif found in cobaltates.
   Whereas cobaltates contain extended planes of CoO6 octahedra, the Co-Pi
   clusters are of molecular dimensions.}},

   evidence. The newly established Western Research and Education Network
   (WestREN) is one such network consisting of a collaboration between the
   Discipline of General Practice at NUI Galway and 71 West of Ireland
   general practices. In September 2009 all member practices were issued
   with a questionnaire with two objectives: to describe the structure and
   characteristics of the member practices and to compare the results to
   the national profile of Irish general practice.
   Methods: A postal survey was used followed by one written and one email
   reminder.
   Results: A response rate of 73\% (52/71) was achieved after two
   reminders. Half of practices were in a rural location, one quarter
   located in an urban setting and another quarter in a mixed location.
   Ninety-four per cent of general practitioners practice from
   purpose-built or adapted premises with under 6\% of practices being
   attached to the general practitioner's residence. Over 96\% of general
   practitioners use appointment systems with 58\% using appointment only.
   All practices surveyed were computerised, with 80\% describing their
   practices as `fully computerised'. Almost 60\% of general practitioners
   are coding chronic diagnoses with 20\% coding individual consultations.
   Twenty-five per cent of general practitioners were single-handed with
   the majority of practices having at least two general practitioners, and
   a mean number of general practitioners of 2.4. Ninety-two per cent of
   practices employed a practice nurse with 30\% employing more than one
   nurse. Compared to the national profile, WestREN practices appear
   somewhat larger, and more likely to be purpose-built and in rural areas.
   National trends apparent between 1982 and 1992, such as increasing
   computerisation and practice nurse availability, appear to be
   continuing.
   Conclusions: WestREN is a new university-affiliated general practice
   research network in Ireland. Survey of its initial membership confirms
   WestREN practices to be broadly representative of the national profile
   and has provided us with valuable information on the current and
   changing structure of Irish general practice.}},

Abstract = {{The amyloid peptides A beta(40) and A beta(42) of Alzheimer's disease
   are thought to contribute differentially to the disease process.
   Although A beta(42) seems more pathogenic than A beta(40), the reason
   for this is not well understood. We show here that small alterations in
   the A beta(42):A beta(40) ratio dramatically affect the biophysical and
   biological properties of the A beta mixtures reflected in their
   aggregation kinetics, the morphology of the resulting amyloid fibrils
   and synaptic function tested in vitro and in vivo. A minor increase in
   the A beta(42):A beta(40) ratio stabilizes toxic oligomeric species with
   intermediate conformations. The initial toxic impact of these A beta
   species is synaptic in nature, but this can spread into the cells
   leading to neuronal cell death. The fact that the relative ratio of A
   beta peptides is more crucial than the absolute amounts of peptides for
   the induction of neurotoxic conformations has important implications for
   anti-amyloid therapy. Our work also suggests the dynamic nature of the
   equilibrium between toxic and non-toxic intermediates. The EMBO Journal

Title = {{Association of the LIPG 584C > T polymorphism and serum lipid levels in
   the Guangxi Bai Ku Yao and Han populations}},
Journal = {{LIPIDS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Endothelial lipase (EL) is a major determinant of
   high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) metabolism, but the
   association of endothelial lipase gene (LIPG) polymorphism and serum
   HDL-C levels is scarce and conflicting in diverse populations. Bai Ku
   Yao is an isolated subgroup of the Yao minority in China. This study was
   designed to detect the association of LIPG 584C > T (rs2000813)
   polymorphism and several environmental factors with serum lipid levels
   in the Guangxi Bai Ku Yao and Han populations.
   Methods: A total of 645 subjects of Bai Ku Yao and 638 participants of
   Han Chinese were randomly selected from our previous stratified
   randomized cluster samples. Genotyping of the LIPG 584C > T was
   performed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length
   polymorphism combined with gel electrophoresis, and then confirmed by
   direct sequencing.
   Results: The levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, low-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein (Apo) AI and ApoB
   were lower in Bai Ku Yao than in Han (P < 0.05 - 0.001). The frequency
   of C and T alleles was 73.5\% and 26.5\% in Bai Ku Yao, and 67.9\% and
   32.1\% in Han (P < 0.01); respectively. The frequency of CC, CT and TT
   genotypes was 50.4\%, 46.2\% and 3.4\% in Bai Ku Yao, and 41.4\%, 53.1\%
   and 5.5\% in Han (P < 0.01); respectively. Serum HDL-C levels in both
   ethnic groups were different among the three genotypes (P < 0.05 for
   each). Serum TC levels in both ethnic groups were also different between
   the CC and CT/TT genotypes (P < 0.05 for each). The T allele carriers
   had higher serum HDL-C and TC levels than the T allele noncarriers.
   Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the levels of
   HDL-C and ApoB were correlated with genotypes in Bai Ku Yao (P < 0.05
   for each), whereas the levels of TC and HDL-C were associated with
   genotypes in Han Chinese (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). Serum lipid parameters
   were also correlated with several environmental factors in the both
   ethnic groups.
   Conclusions: The frequency of LIPG 584T allele is lower in Bai Ku Yao
   than in Han Chinese. The LIPG 584T allele is associated with increased
   serum HDL-C, TC and ApoB levels. The differences in serum HDL-C, TC and
   ApoB levels between the two ethnic groups might partly result from
   different genotypic and allelic frequencies of LIPG 584C > T or
   different LIPG-enviromental interactions.}},

   the forming-free cells show more stable resistive switching

Abstract = {{The removal of toxic anions has been achieved using hydrotalcite via two
   methods: (1) coprecipitation and (2) thermal activation. Hydrotalcite
   formed via the coprecipitation method, using solutions containing
   arsenate and vanadate up to pH 10. are able to remove more than 95\% of
   the toxic anions (0.2 M) from solution. The removal of toxic anions in
   solutions with a pH of >10 reduces the removal uptake percentage to
   similar to 75\%. Raman spectroscopy observed multiple A(1) stretching
   modes of V-O and As-O at similar to 930 and similar to 810 cm(-1),
   assigned to vanadate and arsenate, respectively. Analysis of the
   intensity and position of the AI stretching modes helped to identify the
   vanadate and arsenate specie intercalated into the hydrotalcite
   structure. It has been determined that 3:1 hydrotalcite structure
   predominantly intercalate anions into the interlayer region, while the
   2:1 and 4:1 hydrotalcite structures shows a large portion of anions
   being removed from solution by adsorption processes. Treatment of
   carbonate solutions (0.2 M) containing arsenate and vanadate (0.2 M)
   three times with thermally activated hydrotalcite has been shown to
   remove 76\% and 81\% of the toxic anions, respectively. Thermally
   activated hydrotalcite with a Mg:Al ratio of 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 have all
   been shown to remove 95\% of arsenate and vanadate (25 ppm). At
   increased concentrations of arsenate and vanadate, the removal uptake
   percentage decreased significantly, except for the 4:1 thermally
   activated hydrotalcite. Thermally activated Bayer hydrotalcite has also
   been shown to be highly effective in the removal of arsenate and
   vanadate. The thermal activation of the solid residue component (red
   mud) removes 30\% of anions from solution (100 ppm of both anions),
   while seawater-neutralized red mud removes 70\%. The formation of
   hydrotalcite during the seawater neutralization process removes anions
   via two mechanisms, rather than one observed for thermally activated red
   mud.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the importance of protein-polymer bioconjugates, there is no
   general method for producing homogeneous recombinant protein that
   contains polymer initiators at defined sites. To address this
   deficiency, we designed the amino acid
   4-(2'-bromoisobutyramido)phenylalanine (1) as an initiator in
   atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) that would provide a stable
   linkage between the protein and growing polymer. We synthesized 1 and
   evolved a Methanococcus jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA(CUA)
   pair to genetically encode this initiator in response to an amber codon.
   To demonstrate the utility of this initiator, we produced green
   fluorescent protein (GFP) with 1 site-specifically incorporated on its
   surface (GFP-1). Purified GFP-1 was then used as an initiator under
   standard ATRP conditions with a monomer, oligo(ethylene oxide)
   monomethyl ether methacrylate, efficiently producing a polymer-GFP
   bioconjugate where the polymer is connected at our selected site on GFP.}},

Abstract = {{In this report, stereospecific structural and dynamic features in DNA
   are studied using the site-directed spin labeling technique. A stable
   nitroxide radical, 1-oxyl-4-bromo-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline (R5a),
   was attached postsynthetically to phosphorothioates that were chemically
   introduced, one at a time, at five sites of a DNA duplex. The two
   phosphorothioate diastereomers (R-p or S-p) were separated, and
   nitroxide rotational motions were monitored using electron paramagnetic
   resonance spectroscopy. The resulting spectra vary according to
   diastereomer identity and location of the labeling site, with R-p-R5a
   spectra effectively reporting on local DNA structural features and
   S-p-R5a spectra sensing variations in local DNA motions. This
   establishes R-p- and S-p-R5a as unique probes for investigating nucleic
   acids in a site- and stereospecific manner, which may aid studies of
   stereospecific DNA/protein interactions. In addition, weighted averages
   of individual R-p and S-p spectra match those of R5a attached to mixed
   diastereomers. This suggests that R5a linked to mixed diastereomers
   reports on the composite behaviors of R-p- and S-p-R5a and is useful in
   initial probing of the DNA local environment. This work advances
   understanding of R5a/DNA coupling, and is a key step forward in
   developing a nucleotide-independent spectroscopic probe for studying
   nucleic acids.}},

   two-fold. On the one hand we outline how, exploiting recent theoretical
   developments in the theory of copulas, new multivariate extreme value
   distributions can be easily constructed; in particular, we show how a
   suitable number of parameters can be introduced, a feature not shared by
   traditional extreme value models. On the other hand, we introduce a
   proper new definition of multivariate return period and show the
   differences with (and the advantages over) the definition presently used

Abstract = {{With an increasing requirement to classify traffic and track security
   threats, newer flexible and efficient ways are needed for collecting
   traffic statistics and monitoring network flows. However, traditional
   solutions based on packet sampling do not provide the flexibility
   required for these applications. For example, operators are often
   interested in observing as many unique flows as possible; however,
   random packet sampling is inherently biased towards large flows.
   Operators may also be interested in increasing the fidelity of flow
   measurements for a certain class of flows; such flexibility is lacking
   in today's packet sampling frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel
   architecture called CLAMP that provides an efficient framework to
   implement class-based sampling. At the heart of CLAMP is a novel data
   structure we propose called composite Bloom filter (CBF) that consists
   of a set of Bloom filters working together to encapsulate various class
   definitions. In particular, we show the flexibility and efficacy of
   CLAMP by implementing a simple two-class size-based sampling. We also
   consider different objectives such as maximizing flow coverage and
   improving the accuracy of certain class of flows. In comparison to
   previous approaches that implement simple size-based sampling, our
   architecture requires substantially lower amounts of memory (up to 80x)
   and achieves higher flow coverage (up to 8x more flows) under specific
   configurations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{In electronic devices where a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)
   comprises one or both sides of a plane capacitor, the resulting
   capacitance C can be larger than the ``geometric capacitance{''} C(g)
   determined by the physical separation d between electrodes. This larger
   capacitance is known to result from the Coulomb correlations between
   individual electrons within the low-density 2DEG, which lead to a
   negative thermodynamic density of states. Experiments on such systems
   generally operate in the regime where the average spacing between
   electrons n(-1/2) in the 2DEG is smaller than d and these experiments
   observe C>C(g) by only a few percent. A recent experiment {[}L. Li, C.
   Richter, S. Paetel, T. Kopp, J. Mannhart, and R. Ashoori,
   arXiv:1006.2847 (unpublished)], however, has observed C larger than C(g)
   by almost 40\% while operating in the regime nd(2)<< 1. In this paper we
   argue that at nd(2)<< 1 correlations between the electronic charge of
   opposite electrodes become important. We develop a theory of the
   capacitance for the full range of nd(2). We show that, in the absence of
   disorder, the capacitance can be 4d/a times larger than the geometric
   value, where a << d is the electron Bohr radius. Our results compare
   favorably with the experiment of Li et al. {[}arXiv: 1006.2847

Abstract = {{Brain-synthesized estrogen has been shown to influence synaptic
   structure, function, and cognitive processes. However, the molecular
   mechanisms underlying the rapid effects of estrogen on the dendritic
   spines of cortical neurons are not clear. Estrogen receptor beta (ER
   beta) is expressed in cortical neurons, and ER beta knock-out mice
   display impaired performance in cortically mediated processes,
   suggesting that signaling via this receptor has profound effects on
   cortical neuron function. However, the effect of rapid signaling via ER
   beta on dendritic spines and the signaling pathways initiated by this
   receptor in cortical neurons are unknown. Here, we show that activation
   of ER beta with the specific agonist WAY-200070 results in increased
   spine density and PSD-95 (postsynaptic density-95) accumulation in
   membrane regions. Activation of ER beta by WAY-200070 also resulted in
   the phosphorylation of p21-activated kinase (PAK) and extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in cultured cortical neurons,
   suggesting a mechanism for the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.
   Moreover, we found that aromatase, an enzyme critical for estrogen
   production, is present at presynaptic termini, supporting a role for
   brain-synthesized estrogen as a neuromodulator in the cortex. These
   results implicate ER beta signaling in controlling dendritic spine
   morphology, in part via a PAK/ERK1/2-dependent pathway, and provide

Abstract = {{Objectives We investigated whether the presence of right ventricular
   (RV) abnormalities detected by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)
   predict adverse outcome in patients presenting with frequent premature
   ventricular complexes (PVCs) of left bundle branch block (LBBB)
   morphology.
   Background CMR is a component of the diagnostic workup for the
   differential diagnosis between arrhythmogenic right ventricular
   cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) and idiopathic RV tachycardia. RV
   abnormalities evaluated by CMR could have prognostic importance.
   Methods Four hundred forty consecutive patients with >1,000 PVCs of LBBB
   morphology (minor diagnostic criterion of ARVC/D) and no other
   pre-existing criteria were prospectively enrolled. RV wall motion (WM),
   signal abnormalities, dilation, and reduced ejection fraction evaluated
   by CMR were considered imaging criteria of ARVC/D. Follow-up was
   performed evaluating an index composite end point of 3 cardiac events:
   cardiac death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and appropriate implantable
   cardiac-defibrillator shock.
   Results Subjects with multiple RV abnormalities (RVA-2 group) had worse
   outcome than the no-RVA group (hazard ratio {[}HR]: 48.6; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]: 6.1 to 384.8; p < 0.001). Of the 61 patients
   in the RVA-2 group, only 6 had a definite diagnosis of ARVC/D applying
   the Task Force Criteria. Also, subjects with a single imaging criterion
   (RVA-1 group) had worse outcome than the no-RVA group (HR: 18.2; 95\%
   CI: 2.0 to 162.6; p = 0.01). Patients with only WM abnormalities had
   higher prevalence of cardiac events than no-RVA (HR: 27.2; 95\% CI: 3.0
   to 244.0; p = 0.03).
   Conclusions In subjects with frequent PVC of LBBB morphology, CMR allows
   risk stratification. RV abnormalities were associated with worse
   outcome. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2010;56:1235-43) (C) 2010 by the American

Abstract = {{We study the lattice spacing dependence, or scaling, of physical
   quantities using the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action
   introduced by the HPQCD/UKQCD Collaboration, comparing our results to
   similar simulations with the asqtad fermion action. Results are based on
   calculations with lattice spacings approximately 0.15, 0.12, and 0.09
   fm, using four flavors of dynamical HISQ quarks. The strange and charm
   quark masses are near their physical values, and the light-quark mass is
   set to 0.2 times the strange-quark mass. We look at the lattice spacing
   dependence of hadron masses, pseudoscalar meson decay constants, and the
   topological susceptibility. In addition to the commonly used
   determination of the lattice spacing through the static quark potential,
   we examine a determination proposed by the HPQCD Collaboration that uses
   the decay constant of a fictitious ``unmixed s (s) over bar''
   pseudoscalar meson. We find that the lattice artifacts in the HISQ
   simulations are much smaller than those in the asqtad simulations at the
   same lattice spacings and quark masses.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between anionic form of meso-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)
   porphyrin (TCPP) and calf thymus deoxyribonucleic acid (CT DNA) is
   investigated by measuring UV-vis absorption, steady-state fluorescence,
   steady-state fluorescence anisotropy, time-resolved fluorescence,
   resonance light scattering (RLS). FT-IR and circular dichroism (CD)
   spectra along with the help of atomic force microscopy (AFM) under
   Tris-Borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer solution of pH 8.3. The static mode of
   fluorescence quenching of porphyrin by calf thymus deoxyribonucleic acid
   indicates the formation of a ground-state complex. The formation of
   ground-state complex is a spontaneous molecular interaction procedure in
   which outside groove binding through hydrogen bond or van der Waals
   force plays a major role. For biomedical application this investigation
   is very important as here TCPP, i.e. the anionic porphyrin does not
   bring any changes in the original structure of the CT DNA to selectively
   cleaving the nucleic acid to destroy the cancer or tumor cells whereas
   cationic porphyrin makes change in the protein structure significantly

Abstract = {{Background: Minimally angulated fractures of the distal radius are
   common in children and have excellent outcomes. We conducted a
   randomized controlled trial to determine whether the use of a
   prefabricated splint is as effective as a cast in the recovery of
   physical function.
   Methods: We included 96 children 5 to 12 years of age who were treated
   for a minimally angulated (<= 15 degrees) greenstick or transverse
   fracture of the wrist between April 2007 and September 2009 at a
   tertiary care pediatric hospital. Participants were randomly assigned to
   receive either a prefabricated wrist splint or a short arm cast for four
   weeks. The primary outcome was physical function at six weeks, measured
   using the performance version of the Activities Scale for Kids.
   Additional outcomes included the degree of angulation, range of motion,
   grip strength and complications.
   Results: Of the 96 children, 46 received a splint and 50 a cast. The
   mean Activities Scale for Kids score at six weeks was 92.8 in the splint
   group and 91.4 in the cast group (difference 1.44, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] - 1.75 to 4.62). Thus, the null hypothesis that the
   splint is less effective by at least seven points was rejected. The
   between-group difference in angulation at four weeks was not
   statistically significant (9.85 degrees in the splint group and 8.20
   degrees in the cast group; mean difference 1.65 degrees, 95\% CI - 1.82
   degrees to 5.11 degrees), nor was the between-group differences in range
   of motion, grip strength and complications.
   Interpretation: In children with minimally angulated fractures of the
   distal radius, use of a splint was as effective as a cast with respect
   to the recovery of physical function. In addition, the devices were
   comparable in terms of the maintenance of fracture stability and the
   occurrence of complications. (ClinicalTrials.gov trial register no.
   NCT00610220.)}},

Abstract = {{We study the transport of point size particles in micro-sized
   two-dimensional periodic channels, exhibiting periodically varying
   cross-sections. The particles are subjected to a constant external force
   acting alongside the direction of the longitudinal channel axis and a
   varying force stemming from a periodic potential profile. While particle
   transport in tilted periodic potentials is facilitated by noise, the
   transport through pores with periodically varying cross-sections worsens
   with increasing noise level, i.e. increasing temperature. The
   competition between the noise-assisted propagation for energetic
   potentials and the hampered transport in confined structures leads to a
   striking, non-monotonic behavior which sensitively depends on the phase
   lag of the periodic channel structure and the periodic potential. By
   controlling this phase lag the symmetry could be broken and
   rectification observed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Arsenic is a well-established human carcinogen; however molecular
   mechanisms to arsenic-induced carcinogenesis are complex and elusive.
   The present study identifies a potential biomarker of arsenic exposure,
   and redefines arsenic-induced signaling in stimulation of cell
   proliferation. The effect of arsenic exposure on gene expression was
   evaluated in PBMC of arsenic-exposed individuals selected from a
   severely affected district of West Bengal, India. A novel, un-documented
   biomarker of arsenic exposure. CyclinA was identified by microarray
   analysis from the study. Non-transformed cell lines HaCat and Int407
   when exposed to clinically achievable arsenic concentration showed
   significant increase of CyclinA substantiating the clinical data. An
   associated increase in S phase population of cells in cell cycle,
   indicative of enhanced proliferation was also noticed. On further
   investigation of the pathway to arsenic-induced proliferation, we
   observed that arsenic resulted: ROS generation; activated Erk signaling;
   stimulated AP-1 activity, including immediate early genes, c-Jun and
   c-Fos. N-Acetyl-L-cysteine, a ROS quencher, blocked the arsenic-induced
   effects. Our study underlines a previously undefined mechanism by which
   arsenic imparts its toxicity and results in uncontrolled cell
   proliferation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) nanocomposites with different organoclay
   contents (up to 15 phr) were prepared by a melt compounding procedure,
   followed by a compression-molding step in which the SBR matrix was
   sulfur crosslinked. The vulcanizates were characterized in respect to
   their curing, mechanical and viscoelastic properties, and thermal
   stability. The optimum cure time decreased with increasing organoclay
   content. This effect was attributed to the ammonium modifier present in
   the organoclay, which takes part in the curing reaction acting like an
   accelerator. The results of mechanical test on the vulcanizates showed
   that the nanocomposites presented better mechanical properties than
   unfilled SBR vulcanizate, indicating the nanoreinforcement effect of
   clay on the mechanical properties of SBR/organoclay nanocomposites. The
   addition of organoclay did not significantly change the glass transition
   temperature. However, the heights of tan 5 value at the glass transition
   temperature for the nanocomposites are lower than that of the unfilled
   SBR. This suggests a strong interaction between the organoclay and the
   SBR matrix as the molecular relaxation of the latter is hampered. The
   temperature at which 50\% degradation occurs (T-50) and the temperature
   when the degradation rate is maximum (DTG(max)) showed an improvement in
   thermal stability, probably related to the uniform dispersion of
   organoclay. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 118:

Abstract = {{Covalent modification of proteins by small ubiquitin-like modifier
   (SUMO) regulates various cellular activities in yeast and mammalian
   cells. In Arabidopsis, inactivation of genes encoding SUMO or
   SUMO-conjugation enzymes is lethal, emphasizing the importance of
   SUMOylation in plant development. Despite this, little is known about
   SUMO targets in plants. Here we identified 238 Arabidopsis proteins as
   potential SUMO substrates because they interacted with SUMO-conjugating
   enzyme and/or SUMO protease (ESD4) in the yeast two-hybrid system.
   Compared with the whole Arabidopsis proteome, the identified proteins
   were strongly enriched for those containing high-probability consensus
   SUMO attachment sites, further supporting that they are true SUMO
   substrates. A high-throughput assay was developed in Escherichia coli
   and used to test the SUMOylation of 56\% of these proteins. More than
   92\% of the proteins tested were SUMOylated in this assay by at least
   one SUMO isoform. Furthermore, ADA2b, an ESD4 interactor that was
   SUMOylated in the E. coli system, also was shown to be SUMOylated in
   Arabidopsis. The identified SUMO substrates are involved in a wide range
   of plant processes, many of which were not previously known to involve
   SUMOylation. These proteins provide a basis for exploring the function
   of SUMOylation in the regulation of diverse processes in Arabidopsis.}},

Abstract = {{DADH catalyzes the flavin-dependent oxidative deamination oft-amino
   acids to the corresponding alpha-keto acids and ammonia. Here we report
   the first X-ray crystal structures of DADH at 1.06 angstrom resolution
   and its complexes with iminoarginine (DADH(red)/iminoarginine) and
   iminohistidine (DADH(red)/iminohistidine) at 1.30 angstrom resolution.
   The DADH crystal structure comprises an unliganded conformation and a
   product-bound conformation, which is almost identical to the
   DADH(red)/iminoarginine crystal structure. The active site of DADH was
   partially occupied with iminoarginine product (30\% occupancy) that
   interacts with Tyr53 in the minor conformation of a surface loop. This
   flexible loop forms an ``active site lid{''}, similar to those seen in
   other enzymes, and may play an essential role in substrate recognition.
   The guanidinium side chain of iminoarginine forms a hydrogen bond
   interaction with the hydroxyl of Thr50 and an ionic interaction with
   Glu87. In the structure of DADH in complex with iminohistidine, two
   alternate conformations were observed for iminohistidine where the
   imidazole groups formed hydrogen bond interactions with the side chains
   of His48 and Thr50 and either Glu87 or Gln336. The different
   interactions and very distinct binding modes observed for iminoarginine
   and iminohistidine are consistent with the 1000-fold difference in
   k(cat)/K-m values for D-arginine and D-histidine. Comparison of the
   kinetic data for the activity of DADH on different D-amino acids and the
   crystal structures in complex with iminoarginine and iminohistidine
   establishes that this enzyme is characterized by relatively broad
   substrate specificity, being able to oxidize positively charged and
   large hydrophobic D-amino acids bound within a flask-like cavity.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{392}},

Abstract = {{Many groundwater C-14 age models require the assumption of the delta
   C-13 value of soil CO2 at the time of recharge. Concurrently, delta C-13
   values of DIC are used to estimate the contribution of ``live{''} carbon
   from the soil zone and ``dead{''} carbon via the dissolution of calcite.
   Thus, model ages are critically sensitive to the delta C-13 value of CO2
   in soil.
   Soil CO2 was sampled monthly throughout Utah representing a variety of
   elevations, climates, and plant communities where C-3 plant assemblages
   dominate. A delta C-13 value of similar to-22 +/- 1.5\%. (1 sigma) was
   obtained where plant growth and soil microbial activity are not strongly
   suppressed by aridity. During spring and early summer in highly
   vegetated uplands, a value of -24.0 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand was
   found. Used as model age inputs, the associated uncertainties produce
   errors of +/- 500 and +/- 200 yr, respectively for model ages of
   saturated zone waters.
   At one field station, delta C-13 values of soil CO2 vary between -8
   parts per thousand, at the soil/atmosphere interface to similar to-23
   parts per thousand at depth, confounding the choice of model input
   values depending on where water in the soil column is assumed to acquire
   its gas. Measurements, inverse models, and forward models of delta C-13
   gradients indicate that during recharge, >50\% pore saturation decreases
   the atmospheric exchange such that isotopic gradients are erased at
   depths >10-20 cm. Thus, large vertical gradients in this key input to
   model age calculations can be neglected.
   In summary, this work represents a significant improvement in
   understanding the origin and variability of delta C-13 values extant in
   the vadose zone during recharge, and permit a realistic assessment of
   the uncertainty in 14C ages of saturated zone waters resulting from the
   choice of this parameter. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an elementary introduction to consistent quantum
   theory, as developed by Griffiths and others over the past 25 years. The
   theory is a version of orthodox (Copenhagen) quantum mechanics based on
   the notion that the unique and mysterious feature of quantum, as opposed
   to classical systems, is the simultaneous existence of multiple
   incompatible representations of reality, referred to as
   ``frameworks.{''} A framework is a maximal set of properties of a system
   for which probabilities can be consistently defined. This notion is
   expressed by stating that a framework provides an exhaustive set of
   exclusive alternatives, but no single framework suffices to fully
   characterize a quantum system. Any prediction of the theory must be
   confined to a single framework and combining elements from different
   frameworks leads to quantum mechanically meaningless statements. This
   ``single-framework rule{''} is the precise mathematical statement of
   Bohr's complementarity. It is shown that if the microscopic description
   is assumed to incorporate these elements in a local setting, then
   distant entanglements, macroscopic measurements, wave-function collapse,
   and other features of quantum behavior follow in a logical manner. The
   essential elements of the theory are first explained using the simplest
   quantum system, a single spin-1/2 degree of freedom at one time.}},

Abstract = {{A new heterogeneous secondary amine Pd(II) complex anchored to
   macroporous polystyrene beads, P-Pd(2)(seam)(2)(OAc)(2)] (seam =
   secondary amine), was synthesized by reacting polymer-anchored secondary
   amine with palladium acetate in acetic acid medium. The structure of
   this immobilized complex has been established on the basis of scanning
   electron microscope, thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis,
   atomic absorption spectroscopy, and spectrometric methods like diffuse
   reflectance spectra of solid and Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy. The catalytic activity of the Pd-complex was investigated
   toward the oxidation of various olefins and alcohols in presence of
   tert-butylhydroperoxide as an oxidant. The effects of various parameters
   such as sol-vent, oxidant, reaction time, reaction temperature, amount
   of catalyst, and substrates-to-oxidant ratio have been studied. The
   catalytic results reveal that the present polymer-anchored Pd(II)
   complex can be recycled more than seven times without much loss in the
   catalytic activity. Comparative studies have been done with the
   corresponding unsupported metal complex. The polymer-anchored catalyst
   was found to be superior to its homogeneous counterpart in activity,
   product selectivity, stability, and reusability (c) 2010 Wiley

Abstract = {{Controlled orientation and reserved activity of biomolecules, when
   site-selectively immobilized in a highly integrated manner on a minimal
   time scale, are crucial in designing biosensors for the multiplex
   detection. Here, we describe a novel method for the
   orientation-controlled immobilization of biomolecules based on
   site-selective electrochemical activation of p-hydroxyazobenzene
   self-assembled monolayer (SAM) followed by one-step coupling of
   cysteinyl biomolecules. The p-aminophenol, a product of reductive
   cleavage of p-hydroxyazobenzene, was subsequently oxidized to yield
   p-quinoneimine which then conjugated with cysteinyl biomolecules through
   1,4-Michael addition, thus obviating additional linker agents and the
   related time consumption. Using this method, we selectively activated
   the electrode surface and immobilized laminin peptide IKVAV, a neurite
   promoting motif. When we cultured hippocampal neurons on the electrode,
   the extended neurites were found only within the electrochemically
   activated area. Hence, the proposed method represents a new promising
   platform for the patterning of functional peptides, active proteins, and
   live cells.}},

Title = {{AnnoTrack - a tracking system for genome annotation}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: As genome sequences are determined for increasing numbers of
   model organisms, demand has grown for better tools to facilitate unified
   genome annotation efforts by communities of biologists. Typically this
   process involves numerous experts from the field and the use of data
   from dispersed sources as evidence. This kind of collaborative
   annotation project requires specialized software solutions for efficient
   data tracking and processing.
   Results: As part of the scale-up phase of the ENCODE project
   (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements), the aim of the GENCODE project is to
   produce a highly accurate evidence-based reference gene annotation for
   the human genome. The AnnoTrack software system was developed to aid
   this effort. It integrates data from multiple distributed sources,
   highlights conflicts and facilitates the quick identification,
   prioritisation and resolution of problems during the process of genome
   annotation.
   Conclusions: AnnoTrack has been in use for the last year and has proven
   a very valuable tool for large-scale genome annotation. Designed to
   interface with standard bioinformatics components, such as DAS servers
   and Ensembl databases, it is easy to setup and configure for different
   genome projects. The source code is available at
   http://annotrack.sanger.ac.uk.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Neurotrophins promote neurogenesis and help regulate synaptic
   reorganization. Their dysregulation has been implicated in a number of
   neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Previous studies have shown
   decreased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the
   serum of patients with psychiatric disorders such as major depressive
   disorder (MDD) and conversion disorder (CD). In human patients with
   temporal lobe epilepsy, there is an increase in both BDNF mRNA and
   protein levels in surgically resected hippocampi compared to controls.
   One study of children with epilepsy has found normal to increased serum
   BDNF levels compared to controls. Serum BDNF levels have not been
   investigated in adult patients with epileptic seizures (ES). We
   hypothesized that BDNF would differentiate between ES and psychogenic
   nonepileptic seizures (PNES).
   Methods: We assessed serum BDNF immunoreactivity in 15 patients with ES,
   12 patients with PNES, and 17 healthy volunteers. Serum BDNF levels were
   measured using an enzyme-linked immunoassay.
   Results: Healthy controls showed higher BDNF levels (4,289 +/- 1,810
   pg/mL) compared to patients with PNES (1,033 +/- 435 pg/mL) (p < 0.001).
   However, unexpectedly, healthy controls also showed higher levels of
   BDNF compared to patients with ES without comorbid MDD (977 +/- 565
   pg/mL) (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Unlike children, adults with epilepsy appear to have
   decreased levels of serum BDNF. Reduced serum BDNF levels can be used to
   differentiate adult patients with ES or PNES from healthy controls.
   Further human studies are needed to better understand the
   pathophysiology explaining the decreased serum BDNF levels found in
   epilepsy and in PNES. Neurology (R) 2010;75:1285-1291}},

Abstract = {{In this study, nanosized clay particles were introduced into wood
   fiber/plastic composites (WPCs) to improve their mechanical properties
   and flame retardancy, which are especially important in various
   automotive and construction applications. A high degree of exfoliation
   for nanoclay in the wood fiber/high density polyethylene (HDPE)
   composites was successfully achieved with the aid of maleated HDPE
   (PE-g-MAn), through a melt blending masterbatch process. The structures
   and morphologies of the composites were determined using X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   respectively. This article presents the effects of clay content and
   degree of clay dispersion on the mechanical and physical properties and
   flame retardancy of wood fiber/HDPE composites that contained a small
   amount of clay, in the range of 3-5 wt \%. We concluded that achieving a
   higher degree of dispersion for the nanosized clay particles is critical
   to enhance the mechanical properties and the flame retardancy of WPCs
   when small amounts of clay are used. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Abstract = {{We study numerically multifractal properties of two models of
   one-dimensional quantum maps: a map with pseudointegrable dynamics and
   intermediate spectral statistics and a map with an Anderson-like
   transition recently implemented with cold atoms. Using extensive
   numerical simulations, we compute the multifractal exponents of quantum
   wave functions and study their properties, with the help of two
   different numerical methods used for classical multifractal systems
   (box-counting and wavelet methods). We compare the results of the two
   methods over a wide range of values. We show that the wave functions of
   the Anderson map display a multifractal behavior similar to
   eigenfunctions of the three-dimensional Anderson transition but of a
   weaker type. Wave functions of the intermediate map share some common
   properties with eigenfunctions at the Anderson transition (two sets of
   multifractal exponents, with similar asymptotic behavior), but other
   properties are markedly different (large linear regime for multifractal
   exponents even for strong multifractality, different distributions of
   moments of wave functions, and absence of symmetry of the exponents).
   Our results thus indicate that the intermediate map presents original
   properties, different from certain characteristics of the Anderson
   transition derived from the nonlinear sigma model. We also discuss the
   importance of finite-size effects.}},

Abstract = {{We have used a combined approach of NMR spectroscopy and isothermal
   titration calorimetry (ITC) to determine the ligand-binding mechanism
   employed by a cocaine-binding aptamer. We found that the length of the
   stem containing the 3' and 5' termini determines the nature of the
   binding mechanism. When this stem is six base pairs long, the secondary
   structure of the aptamer is fully folded in the free form and only
   putative tertiary interactions form with ligand binding. If this stem is
   shortened by three base pairs, the free form of the aptamer contains
   little secondary structure, and ligand binding triggers secondary
   structure formation and folding. This binding mechanism is supported by
   both NMR spectral changes and the ITC measured heat capacity of binding
   (Delta C-p degrees). For the aptamer with the long stem the Delta C-p
   degrees value is -557 +/- 29 cal mol(-1) K-1 for the aptamer with the
   short stem the Delta C-p degrees value is -922 +/- 51 cal mol(-1) K-1.
   Chemical shift perturbation data and the observation of intermolecular
   NOEs indicate that the three-way junction is the site of ligand binding.}},

Abstract = {{The multicomponent transfer of functional molecules by Langmuir-Blodgett
   (LB) technique onto solid substrates offers an interesting route for
   generation of functionalized patterns by self-assembly over large
   surface areas. In the present paper, we discuss LB transfer of mixed LB
   films containing different functional amphiphiles (an aside, an estrone
   derivate, a lithocholic acid derivative, or an alkoxyamine) in
   combination with dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline (DPPC). The effect of
   the mixing ratio on pattern formation is discussed, and we provide some
   general design rules for the synthesis of functional molecules to be
   applicable for the multicomponent LB transfer process. We show that
   these functional compounds can be successfully transferred to oxidized
   Si wafers in stripe pattern. Covalent attachment of the functional
   entities is easily achieved, and the patterned surfaces are then ready
   for further chemical manipulation. This is demonstrated by
   site-specifically covalent attaching dye molecules applying the
   copper(1)-catalyzed alkyne aside click reaction (CuAAC), the thiol-ene
   reaction, and a surface-initiated radical polymerisation.}},

Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{15302-15309}},

Abstract = {{New composites based on HKUST-1 and graphene layers are tested for
   ammonia adsorption at room temperature in both dry and moist conditions.
   The materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction, FT-IR
   spectroscopy, adsorption of nitrogen, and thermal analyses. Unlike other
   MOF/GO composites reported in previous studies, these materials are
   water-stable. Ammonia adsorption capacities on the composites are higher
   than the ones calculated for the physical mixture of components,
   suggesting the presence of a synergetic effect between the MOF and
   graphene layers. The increased porosity and dispersive forces being the
   consequence of the presence of graphene layers are responsible for the
   enhanced adsorption. In addition toils retention via physical forces,
   ammonia is also adsorbed via binding to the copper sites in H K UST-1
   and then, progressively, via reaction with the MOF component. This
   reactive adsorption is visible through two successive changes of the
   adsorbents' color during the breakthrough tests. More ammonia is
   adsorbed in moist conditions than in dry conditions owing to its
   dissolution in a water film present in the pore system.}},

Title = {{Interethnic diversity of NAT2 polymorphisms in Brazilian admixed
   populations}},
Journal = {{BMC GENETICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: N-acetyltransferase type 2 (Nat2) is a phase II
   drug-metabolizing enzyme that plays a key role in the bioactivation of
   aromatic and heterocyclic amines. Its relevance in drug metabolism and
   disease susceptibility remains a central theme for pharmacogenetic
   research, mainly because of its genetic variability among human
   populations. In fact, the evolutionary and ethnic-specific SNPs on the
   NAT2 gene remain a focus for the potential discoveries in personalized
   drug therapy and genetic markers of diseases. Despite the wide
   characterization of NAT2 SNPs frequency in established ethnic groups,
   little data are available for highly admixed populations. In this
   context, five common NAT2 SNPs (G191A, C481T, G590A, A803G and G857A)
   were investigated in a highly admixed population comprised of
   Afro-Brazilians, Whites, and Amerindians in northeastern Brazil. Thus,
   we sought to determine whether the distribution of NAT2 polymorphism is
   different among these three ethnic groups.
   Results: Overall, there were no statistically significant differences in
   the distribution of NAT2 polymorphism when Afro-Brazilian and White
   groups were compared. Even the allele frequency of 191A, relatively
   common in African descendents, was not different between the
   Afro-Brazilian and White groups. However, allele and genotype
   frequencies of G590A were significantly higher in the Amerindian group
   than either in the Afro-Brazilian or White groups. Interestingly, a
   haplotype block between G590A and A803G was verified exclusively among
   Amerindians.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that ethnic admixture might contribute
   to a particular pattern of genetic diversity in the NAT2 gene and also
   offer new insights for the investigation of possible new NAT2
   gene-environment effects in admixed populations.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the most severe form of malaria
   disease in humans, causing more than 1 million deaths each year. As an
   obligate intracellular parasite, P. falciparum's ability to invade
   erythrocytes is essential for its survival within the human host. P.
   falciparum invades erythrocytes using multiple host receptor-parasite
   ligand interactions known as invasion pathways. Here we show that CR1 is
   the host erythrocyte receptor for PfRh4, a major P. falciparum ligand
   essential for sialic acid-independent invasion. PfRh4 and CR1 interact
   directly, with a K(d) of 2.9 mu M. PfRh4 binding is strongly correlated
   with the CR1 level on the erythrocyte surface. Parasite invasion via
   sialic acid-independent pathways is reduced in low-CR1 erythrocytes due
   to limited availability of this receptor on the surface. Furthermore,
   soluble CR1 can competitively block binding of PfRh4 to the erythrocyte
   surface and specifically inhibit sialic acid-independent parasite
   invasion. These results demonstrate that CR1 is an erythrocyte receptor
   used by the parasite ligand PfRh4 for P. falciparum invasion.}},

Abstract = {{Background Vaccinium uliginosum L. is a type of blueberry found in the
   Chinese Changbai Mountains. We extracted Vaccinium uliginosum Anthocyan
   ins (A(V.uli)) to investigate its bioactivity on suppressing cancer
   cells.
   Methods A(V.uli) was extracted under different conditions of temperature
   (10 degrees C-35 degrees C), pH 1.0-3.0, and diatomaceous earth (1.0
   g-3.0 g), followed by a HPLC analysis for the determination of the
   ingredients. Its anticancer bioactivities on human colon and colorectal
   cancer cells (DLD-1 and COLO205) were compared with those on Lonicera
   caerulea Anthocyanins (A(L.cae)) and Vaccinium myrtillus Anthocyanins
   (A(V.myr)), using cell viability assays, DNA electrophoresis and nuclear
   morphology assays.
   Results The optimum process of A(V.uli) extraction involved conditions
   of temperature 20 degrees C, pH 2.0, and diatomaceous earth 1.0 g/50 g
   of fruit weight. A(V.uli) contained 5 main components: delphinidin
   (40.70 +/- 1.72)\%, cyanidin (3.40 +/- 0.68)\%, petunidin (17.70 +/-
   0.54)\%, peonidin (2.90 +/- 0.63)\% and malvidin (35.50 +/- 1.11)\%. The
   malvidin percentage was significantly higher (P <0.05) than it in
   A(V.myr). A(V.uli) complied with a dose-dependent repression of cancer
   cell proliferation with an IC50 (50\% inhibitory concentration) value of
   50 mu g/ml, and showed greater anticancer efficiency than A(L. cae) and
   A(V. myr) under the same cell treatment conditions. These observations
   were further supported by the results of nuclear assays.
   Conclusions The extraction protocol and conditions we used were
   effective for anthocyanin extraction. A(V. uli) could be a feasible
   practical research tool and a promising therapeutic source to suppress
   human colon or colorectal cancers. Chin Med J 2010;123(19):2714-2719}},

Abstract = {{Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved catabolic process involved in
   several physiological and pathological processes such as cancer and
   neuro-degeneration. Autophagy initiation signaling requires both the
   ULK1 kinase and the BECLIN 1-VPS34 core complex to generate
   autophagosomes, double-membraned vesicles that transfer cellular
   contents to lysosomes. In this study, we show that the BECLIN 1-VPS34
   complex is tethered to the cytoskeleton through an interaction between
   the BECLIN 1-interacting protein AMBRA1 and dynein light chains 1/2.
   When autophagy is induced, ULK1 phosphorylates AMBRA1, releasing the
   autophagy core complex from dynein. Its subsequent relocalization to the
   endoplasmic reticulum enables autophagosome nucleation. Therefore,
   AMBRA1 constitutes a direct regulatory link between ULK1 and BECLIN
   1-VPS34, which is required for core complex positioning and activity
   within the cell. Moreover, our results demonstrate that in addition to a
   function for microtubules in mediating autophagosome transport, there is
   a strict and regulatory relationship between cytoskeleton dynamics and
   autophagosome formation.}},

   isopropoxydimethylsilyl function generated via addition of
   (chlorodimethylsilyl)-pinacolborane provided access to hydroxymethyl

Abstract = {{In this study we report a theoretical comparative study of some
   photophysical properties in the {[}Ru(bpy)(3-x)(dab)(x)](2+) (x = 0-3)
   series. Density functional theory calculations, validated by highly
   correlated ab initio benchmark calculations, were used to investigate
   the absorption and emission properties of the complexes with x = 1-3.
   The presence of a 1,4-diaza-1,3-butadiene (dab) ligand dramatically
   changes these properties because of the strong pi-acceptor character of
   this ligand. As a result, comparing to the reference {[}Ru(bpy)(3)](2+)
   complex previously studied, we observed (i) a strong red-shift of the
   maximum of the absorption band, (ii) a strong decrease of the emission
   energy of the lowest triplet metal-to-hgand charge transfer state, with
   all the {[}Ru(bpy)(3-x)(dab)(x)](2+) (x = 1-3) complexes luminescent in
   the near-infrared region, while {[}Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) emits in the visible
   region, and (iii) the triplet metal-centered states become inaccessible
   in all the {[}Ru(bpy)(3-x)(dab)(x)](2+) (x = 1-3) complexes.
   Consequently, these complexes could be potential candidates for infrared
   light-emitting diodes and probes.}},

   plants (Dianthus caryophyllus L. cv. `Turbo') grown in soil under
   greenhouse conditions. Class A Pan was used to determine irrigation
   water amounts. Yield and quality parameters (stem length, stem fresh
   weight, flower diameter and stem diameter) were significantly (p < 0.01)
   affected by the irrigation water amount and irrigation interval. While
   node number was affected by irrigation water amount, irrigation interval
   did not affect node number. The highest total flower number per m(2) was
   recorded in I(1)k(cp)4 (89.56 flowers m(-2)), whereas the lowest total
   flower number per m(-2) was found in I(3)k(cp)1 (10.0 flowers m(-)2).
   Among the irrigation water amounts, the longest stems were determined in
   k(cp)5 (71.04 cm) and k(cp)4 (69.30 cm); however, the difference between
   both treatments was statistically insignificant. Among the irrigation
   intervals, the longest stem (67.56 cm) was obtained from the carnations
   irrigated with high irrigation interval (I-1). The treatments with both
   the same irrigation water amount and higher irrigation intervals
   produced higher flowers yield and quality.}},

Title = {{SHMT1 1420 and MTHFR 677 variants are associated with rectal but not

Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Association between rectal or colon cancer risk and serine
   hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1) C1420T or methylenetetrahydrofolate
   reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphisms was assessed. The serum total
   homocysteine (HCY), marker of folate metabolism was also investigated.
   Methods: The SHMT1 and MTHFR genotypes were determined by real-time PCR
   and PCR-RFLP, respectively in 476 patients with rectal, 479 patients
   with colon cancer and in 461 and 478, respective controls matched for
   age and sex. Homocysteine levels were determined by HPLC kit. The
   association between polymorphisms and cancer risk was evaluated by
   logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex and body mass index.
   The population stratification bias was also estimated.
   Results: There was no association of genotypes or diplotypes with colon
   cancer. The rectal cancer risk was significantly lower for SHMT1 TT (OR
   = 0.57, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.89) and higher for MTHFR CT
   genotypes (OR = 1.4, 95\% CI 1.06-1.84). A gene-dosage effect was
   observed for SHMT1 with progressively decreasing risk with increasing
   number of T allele (p = 0.014). The stratified analysis according to age
   and sex revealed that the association is mainly present in the younger
   (< 60 years) or male subgroup. As expected from genotype analysis, the
   SHMT1 T allele/MTHFR CC diplotype was associated with reduced rectal
   cancer risk (OR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.42-0.77 vs all other diplotypes
   together). The above results are unlikely to suffer from population
   stratification bias. In controls HCY was influenced by SHMT1
   polymorphism, while in patients it was affected only by Dukes' stage. In
   patients with Dukes' stage C or D HCY can be considered as a tumor
   marker only in case of SHMT1 1420CC genotypes.
   Conclusions: A protective effect of SHMT1 1420T allele or SHMT1 1420 T
   allele/MTHFR 677 CC diplotype against rectal but not colon cancer risk
   was demonstrated. The presence of SHMT1 1420 T allele significantly
   increases the HCY levels in controls but not in patients. Homocysteine
   could be considered as a tumor marker in SHMT1 1420 wild-type (CC) CRC
   patients in Dukes' stage C and D. Further studies need to clarify why
   SHMT1 and MTHFR polymorphisms are associated only with rectal and not
   colon cancer risk.}},

   follows: pH 5.4, 35 degrees C, 0.5222 Aw; pH 5.4, 35 degrees C, 0.7533
   Aw; pH 5.4, 40 degrees C, 0.7533 Aw; respectively. The highest
   volumetric activity was obtained using A. foetidus with 2.58 U ml(-1),
   when grew on grapefruit rind. Among the strains used, optimal
   naringinase production was with A. foetidus. The use of grapefruit rind
   as a substrate gave a higher yield of naringinase production than using
   orange rind.}},

Abstract = {{From past to future, it is impossible to imagine or evaluate
   architecture without habitat. This study titled ``Reflection of habitat
   on architecture: Ankara from the Republic proclamation to our days{''}
   aims to discuss the architectural expression of surroundings in Ankara
   from the proclamation of the Republic to our days in consideration of
   the idea that architecture is an expression of habitat. The reason
   behind the choice of Ankara in the scope of the study is its being a
   capital that has seen very different unique breaking points starting
   from the proclamation of the Republic in the context of its social
   structure. The study aims to explore how the architectural output has
   been affected by the habitat based on the said breaking points.}},

Abstract = {{Tourism and information technology is dynamic. The prosperity of tour
   operators are directly influenced by their ability to make informed
   decisions. This paper investigates if South African tour operators use
   marketing/management information systems and to determine their
   susceptibility towards information system innovation. The results could
   assist tourism role players and tour operators to reconsider their
   information systems, as well as to identify opportunities for
   information system innovation. A questionnaire was distributed to 1,000
   tour operators and this paper is based on the responses of tour
   operators who do have an information system. The results obtained
   indicate that 59.6\% of those who participated do have some form of
   information system whilst 39.7\% were uncertain what type of information
   system they have. A majority of tour operators indicated that they use
   personal computers with word processing and electronic spreadsheets.
   Tour operators indicated that they would support an innovated marketing
   information system that operates from a central location on a national
   basis. This pioneer study established that tour operators have a
   desperate need for marketing information system innovation. There is a
   significant opportunity for further research and information system
   innovation in the South African tour operating environment.}},

   between Geometries of Excited States and Phosphorescence Spectra}},
Journal = {{INORGANIC CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2010}},

Pages = {{8977-8985}},
Month = {{OCT 4}},
Abstract = {{Dinuclear platinum(II) complexes {[}Pt-2(mu-pz)(2)(bpym)(2)](2+) (1; pz
   = pyrazolate and bpym = 2,2'-bipyrimidine) and {[}Pt2(p-pyt)2(ppy)72]
   (2; pyt = pyridine-2-thiolate and Hppy = 2-phenylpyridine) were
   theoretically investigated with density functional theory (DFT) to
   clarify the reasons why the phosphorescence of 1 is not observed in the
   acetonitrile (CH3CN) solution at room temperature (RT) but observed in
   the solid state at RT and why the phosphorescence of 2 is observed in
   both the CH3CN solution and the solid state at RT. The S-1 and T-1
   states of 1 in the CH3CN solution are assigned as a metal
   metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MMLCT) excited state. Their geometries
   are C-2, symmetrical, in which spin orbit interaction between the SI and
   T-1 excited states is absent because the direct product of irreducible
   representations of the singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs) of
   these excited states and the orbital angular momentum (/) operator
   involved in the Hamiltonian for spin orbit interaction does not belong
   to the a(1) representation. As a result, the SI T-1 intersystem crossing
   hardly occurs, leading to the absence of T-1 So phosphorescence in the
   CH3CN solution at RT. In the solid state, the geometry of the Si state
   does not reach the global minimum but stays in the Crsymmetrical local
   minimum. This S-1 excited state is assigned as a mixture of the
   ligand-centered pi-pi{*} excited state and the metal-to-ligand
   charge-transfer excited state. Spin orbit interaction between the SI and
   T-1 excited states operates to induce the S-1 T-1 intersystem crossing
   because the direct product of the irreducible representations of the
   SOMOs of these excited states and the operator belongs to the ``a{''}
   representation. As a result, T-1 So phosphorescence occurs in the solid
   state. In 2, the S-1 and T-1 excited states are assigned as the MMLCT
   excited state. Their geometries are C-2-symmetrical in both the CH3CN
   solution and the solid state, in which spin orbit interaction between
   the Si and T-1 states operates to induce the Si T-1 intersystem crossing
   because the direct product of the irreducible representations of the
   SOMOs and the I operator belongs to the ``a{''} representation. Thus,
   T-1 So phosphorescence occurs in both the CH3CN solution and the solid
   state at RI, unlike 1.}},

Abstract = {{A surfactantless, trouble-free, and gentle wet chemistry approach has
   been used to interpret the precisely controlled growth of beta-Ni(OH)(2)
   with the assistance of ammonia and nickel acetate from seedless mild
   hydrothermal conditions. A thorough investigation of the reaction
   kinetics and product morphology with varied concentration of NH3 and
   different reaction times suggests that a putative mechanism of
   dissolution, recrystallization, and oriented attachment supports the
   intelligent self-assembly of nanobuilding blocks. Associated
   characterizations (FTIR, PXRD, FESEM, EDAX, HRTEM, and Raman) have
   identified it to be pure beta-Ni(OH)(2) without any signature of
   contamination. The assembled units result in porous frameworks
   (nanoflowers and nanocolumns) and are indeed full of communally
   intersecting nanopetals/nanoplates with both lengths and widths on the
   order of micrometer to nanometer length scale. The as-synthesized
   material could also be used as a precursor for nanometric black NiO
   under calcination. The hydroxide has been found to be a potent and
   environmentally benign material because it warrants its photocatalytic
   activity through dye mineralization. Finally, Ni(OH)(2) has been
   photochemically derivatized with dosages of silver nanoparticles
   bringing a competent composite authority Ag@Ni(OH)(2), to give a
   full-proof enhanced field effect of prolific SEAS activity. In a
   nutshell, these results are encouraging and fetch new promise for the
   fabrication of a low-cost and high-yielding greener synthetic Protocol
   for a functional material with promising practicability.}},

Abstract = {{Following a genome-wide search for a blood stage malaria DNA-based
   vaccine using web-based bioinformatic tools, 29 genes from the annotated
   Plasmodium yoelii genome sequence (www.PlasmoDB.org and www.tigr.org)
   were identified as encoding GPI-anchored proteins. Target genes were
   those with orthologues in P. falciparum, containing an N-terminal signal
   sequence containing hydrophobic amino acid stretch and signal P
   criteria, a transmembrane-like domain and GPI anchor motif. Focusing on
   the blood stage, we extracted mRNA from pRBCs. PCR-amplified 22 out of
   the 29 selected genes, and eventually cloned nine of these into a DNA
   vaccine plasmid, pVAX 200-DEST. Biojector-mediated delivery of the nine
   DNA vaccines was conducted using ShimajET to C57BL/6 mice at a dose of 4
   mu g/mouse three times at an interval of 3 weeks. Two weeks after the
   second booster, immunized mice were challenged with P. y. yoelii
   17XL-parasitized RBCs and the level of parasitaemia, protection and
   survival was assessed. Immunization with one gene (PY03470) resulted in
   2-4 days of delayed onset and level of parasitaemia and was associated
   with increased survival compared to non-immunized mice. Antibody
   production was, however, low following DNA vaccination, as determined by
   immunofluorescence assay. Recombinant protein from this gene, GP18p
   transamidase-related protein (rPyTAM) in PBS or emulsified with GERBU
   adjuvant was also used to immunize another set of C57BL/6 mice with
   10-20 mu g/mouse three times at 3-week interval. Higher antibody
   response was obtained as determined by EL1SA with similar protective
   effects as observed after DNA vaccination. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

   S-phosphoramidite with S,S-diamine. In that case the product was
   obtained with high enantioselectivity and the R-configuration. The
   mismatched case produced the product in lower ee. The product
   configuration was determined by the configuration of the diamine ligand.

   known technique in detecting human appearance within image, it faces
   several drawbacks when using colour as cue to detect skin. First, the
   difficulty is when the colour between skin and non skin within an image
   is similar. Second, the skin appearance of humans when exposed under
   different lighting condition adds the complexity to skin detection.
   Therefore, this paper proposed a new hybrid module for skin detector
   using backprobgation neural network and heuristic rules based on YCbCr
   with the purpose to improve the skin detection performance. Using the
   new hybrid module, the researcher managed to increase the classification
   reliability when discriminating human skin colour and regularize the
   problem when exposed to different lighting conditions. The new proposed
   skin detector depends on normalization technique to normalize the inputs
   and targets so that they fall in the interval {[}-1, 1] and trained with
   training set of skin and non-skin pixels. Using the techniques
   discriminates human for images having upright frontal skin with any
   background achieved high detection rates, scored an 88.5\%
   classification and low false positives when comparing with the previous
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Using the output of the intraseasonal hindcast experiment conducted with
   the GEM global atmospheric model during 24 extended winters, the
   association between the forecast skill of the NAO and the amplitude and
   phase of the MJO in the initial condition is investigated. It is found
   that with a lead time up to about one month the NAO forecast skill is
   significantly influenced by the existence of the MJO signal in the
   initial condition. A strong MJO leads to a better NAO forecast skill
   than a weak MJO. An initial state with an MJO phase corresponding to a
   dipole tropical convection anomaly in the eastern Indian Ocean and
   western Pacific favors a more skillful NAO forecast than an MJO phase
   with a single tropical convection anomaly near 120 E. These results
   indicate that it is possible to increase the skill of the NAO and the
   extratropical surface air temperature intraseasonal forecast with an
   improved tropical initialization, a better prediction of the tropical
   MJO and a better representation of the tropical-extratropical
   interaction in dynamical models. Citation: Lin, H., G. Brunet, and J. S.

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that magnetospheric radiation

   mixtures, reactions that take place without the need for a

   produce sulfur oxyanions, such as bisulfite, that as much as 30\% of the
   SO(2) can be consumed through this reaction, and that the products
   remain in the ice when the temperature is lowered, indicating that these

Title = {{NK cell depletion delays corneal allograft rejection in baby rats}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Penetrating keratoplasty has a very poor outcome compared with
   adults if performed in the first years of life. Rejection in these young
   patients occurs even in the absence of known immunological risk factors.
   Recently, a baby rat model was introduced and an essential contribution
   of natural killer (NK) cells during allograft rejection was suggested.
   To analyze this, NK cells were depleted in baby rats before
   keratoplasty.
   Methods: Allogeneic keratoplasty was performed between Lewis and Fisher
   rats. The recipient's ages were 10 and 3 weeks, respectively. NK cells
   were depleted by an intraperitoneal injection of a monoclonal antibody.
   All experiments were controlled by the injection of isotypic control
   antibodies and syngeneically. Survival rates were calculated and
   cellular infiltrates were analyzed histologically.
   Results: NK cell depletion did delay median graft survival times in a
   statistically significantly way compared with the control animals
   (p<0.01). At median rejection time points, macrophages, CD4(+) T cells
   and CD25(+) leukocytes infiltrated to a greater extent in the depleted
   recipients. No significant changes in the cell numbers of infiltrating
   CD8(+) T cells were observed.
   Conclusions: We conclude that NK cells play a role during allograft
   rejection in baby rats, but their effect is replaceable. A greater
   infiltration of macrophages and CD4(+) T cells suggests that they might
   compensate for the missing NK cells' response in this experimental
   setting. Our results represent another step toward understanding the
   complex mechanisms of an accelerated corneal graft rejection in infant
   recipients.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a new multiplexed-PCR assay to accurately classify
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) isolates at the sublineage
   level by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This method relies on 7
   SNPs located in different genes of the MTC strains (recC, rec0, recR,
   ligB, ligC, alkA, and mgtC). Most of these genes are involved in
   replication, repair and recombination (3R) functions of M. tuberculosis
   strains, four of the mutations are synonymous, and thus neutral. Genes
   were chosen as a first empirical approach to assess the congruence
   between spoligotyping-based phylogeographical classification and SNP
   typing.
   This scheme efficiently classifies most of MTC phylogeographical groups:
   (1) confirming and identifying new sublineage-specific SNPs, (2)
   unraveling phylogenetical relationships between spoligotyping-defined
   MTC sublineages, (3) appropriately assigning sublineages to some
   spoligotypes and reassigning sublineages to other mis-labeled
   spoligotype signatures. This study opens the way to a more meaningful
   taxonomic, evolutionary and epidemiological classification. It also
   allows evaluation of spoligotype-signature significance towards a more
   comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms of the
   clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) locus

Title = {{Spatial distribution of lead concentrations in urban surface soils of

Abstract = {{Immediately following hurricane Katrina concern was raised over the
   environmental impact of floodwaters on the city of New Orleans,
   especially in regard to human health. Several studies were conducted to
   determine the actual contaminant distribution throughout the city and
   surrounding wetlands by analyzing soil, sediment, and water for a
   variety of contaminants including organics, inorganics, and biologics.
   Preliminary investigations by The Institute of Environmental and Human
   Health at Texas Tech University concluded that soils and sediments
   contained pesticides, semi-volatiles, and metals, specifically arsenic,
   iron, and lead, at concentrations that could pose a significant risk to
   human health. Additional studies on New Orleans floodwaters revealed
   similar constituents as well as compounds commonly found in gasoline.
   More recently, it has been revealed that lead (Pb), arsenic, and
   vanadium are found intermittently throughout the city at concentrations
   greater than the human health soil screening levels (HHSSLs) of 400, 22
   (non-cancer endpoint) and 390 mu g/g, respectively. Of these, Pb appears
   to present the greatest exposure hazard to humans as a result of its
   extensive distribution in city soils. In this study, we spatially
   evaluated Pb concentrations across greater New Orleans surface soils. We
   established 128 sampling sites throughout New Orleans at approximately
   half-mile intervals. A soil sample was collected at each site and
   analyzed for Pb by ICP-AES. Soils from 19 (15\%) of the sites had Pb
   concentrations exceeding the HHSSL threshold of 400 mu g/g. It was
   determined that the highest concentrations of Pb were found in the south
   and west portions of the city. Pb concentrations found throughout New
   Orleans in this study were then incorporated into a geographic
   information system to create a spatial distribution model that can be
   further used to predict Pb exposure to humans in the city.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To explore if beta-adrenergic receptors in the brain are
   involved in acute and delayed cardiovascular responses to a brief
   emotional stress, by comparing the effects of the beta 1-blockers
   metoprolol (lipophilic) and atenolol (hydrophilic). Design. Male
   dominant pigs, singleliving, freely moving, with telemetric recordings
   of intra-arterial pressure and ECG and assay of plasma levels of the
   adrenergic cotransmittor neuropeptideY (NPY), were confronted with four
   alien pigs for three minutes at weekly intervals. Weeks 1 and 4 were
   controls, in weeks 2 and 3 randomized crossover treatment with
   metoprolol or atenolol were given. Results. The confrontation caused
   instant and transient tachycardia and more prolonged effects in terms of
   increased plasma NPY levels, increased arterial pressure and reduced
   cardiac vagal activation. The two beta-blockers inhibited the
   tachycardia equally, but only metoprolol reduced the prolonged effects.
   Conclusions. Emotionally induced sympathetic activation involves
   peripheral release of NPY causing a prolonged increase of arterial
   pressure and a reduction of cardiac vagal activity. These effects are
   prevented by central nervous beta-adrenoceptor blockade.}},

Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{475-488}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Calc-silicates have proved to be important rock types to place
   constraints on the fluid behaviour in high grade metamorphic rocks. Here
   we describe amphibolite facies calc-silicate rocks of Wadi Solaf, Egypt
   which is one of the highest grade basement complexes of Egypt and was
   exhumed in close connection with the Najd fault system - one of the
   largest pre-Mesozoic fault systems on the Earth. Calc-silicates formed
   around 7-8 kbar in temperature range of 600-720 degrees C and can be
   classified into three groups (CS1, CS2 and CS3). CS1 and CS2 are
   characterized by the presence of garnet porphyroblasts which contain
   concentrically arranged wollastonite inclusions. CS3 has a similar
   paragenesis but is characterized by the presence of clinozoisite/epidote
   and the absence of wollastonite as well as a pervasive late overgrowth
   of prehnite. Garnet in CS1 lies along a grossular-andradite solid
   solution, while the garnet composition of CS2 and CS3 is hydrogrossular
   and hydroandradite. There is a positive correlation between Al2O3 and
   Na2O as well as between Al2O3 and Fe2O3 from CS2 through CS1 to CS3
   possibly indicating a successive increase in fluid flow between the
   different calc-silicate types. During the peak metamorphism, the XCO2 is
   0.02-0.08 and 0.2-0.44 for the CS1 and CS3, respectively. The mineral
   assemblage of CS1 and CS2 buffered the composition of the fluids along
   the reaction: q + cc = wo + CO2. During post-peak metamorphism the rocks
   were intruded by syn-tectonic granites. CS2 records the contact
   metamorphic conditions. The rocks reached a peak contact metamorphism
   conditions at temperature 790-828 degrees C and XCO2 = 0.22-0.41.
   Finally, the rocks reached a temperature range 296-311 degrees C during
   the cooling path. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Thalamic deep brain stimulation for intractable Tourette
   Syndrome was introduced in 1999 by Vandewalle et al. In this follow-up
   study, the authors report on the long-term (6 and 10 years) outcome in
   terms of tic reduction, cognition, mood and side effects of medial
   thalamic deep brain stimulation in two previously described Tourette
   patients.
   Methods The authors compared the outcome of two patients at 6 and 10
   years after surgery with their preoperative status and after 8 months
   and 5 years of treatment, respectively. Standardised video recordings
   were scored by three independent investigators. Both patients underwent
   (neuro) psychological assessment at all time points of follow-up.
   Results Tic improvement observed at 5 years in patient 1 (90.1\%) was
   maintained at 10 years (92.6\%). In patient 2, the tic improvement at 8
   months (82\%) was slightly decreased at 6 years (78\%). During
   follow-up, case 1 revealed no changes in cognition, but case 2 showed a
   decrease in verbal fluency and learning which was in line with his
   subjective reports. Case 2 showed a slight decrease in depression, but
   overall psychopathology was still high at 6 years after surgery with an
   increase in anger and aggression together with difficulties in social
   adaptation. Besides temporary hardware-related complications, no
   distressing adverse effects were observed.
   Conclusion Bilateral thalamic stimulation may provide sustained tic
   benefit after at least 6 years, but to maximise overall outcome,
   attention is needed for postoperative psychosocial adaptation, already
   prior to surgery.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method that can differentiate between the varieties of
   grapes and the vintages of wines and show the relationship between the
   grapes, the wine and the geographic location. The place of origin and
   its geographic and climatic characteristics were determined by the
   isotopic ratios, C-13/C-12 of the ethanol and O-18/O-16 of the water
   content of wine (wine water), for southern Brazil wines. The producing
   subregions of Pinto Bandeira, Vale dos Vinhedos and Nova Padua showed
   differences in the temperature, rainfall and humidity conditions used
   for the production under microvinification conditions of Merlot and
   Cabernet Sauvignon varieties, in the harvests of 2005 and 2006. An
   isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled to an elemental analyzer was
   used to measure the C-13/C-12 of ethanol and the O-18/O-16 of wine
   water. Regardless of the grape variety used, it was possible to
   determine the subregion through measurement of the delta O-18 values in
   both harvests. The altitudes of the different subregions led to
   statistical differences and demonstrated an influence mainly on the
   delta O-18 values of wine water. The delta O-18 value of wine water was
   determined to be more selective for the determination of the cultivation
   subregions than the delta C-13 value of the ethanol. The altitude and
   latitude influenced mainly the delta O-18 values of wine water and the
   ethanol. The climatic influences are more noteworthy in distinguishing
   the year of the harvest than the cultivation subregion. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell dyscrasia accounting for 10\% of
   all hematologic malignancies. Diagnosis is based on histologic,
   serologic and radiographic features. The nephrotoxic manifestations of
   immunoglobulin light chain overproduction are the most common cause of
   renal function impairment. The most frequent renal lesion is ``cast
   nephropathy{''} and results from immunoglobulin light chain
   nephrotoxicity. MM very rarely produces diffuse bilateral renal
   infiltration. We report the interesting case of a patient with
   non-secretory myeloma, who presented with acute renal failure and
   increased kidney size due to massive renal infiltration by plasma cells.
   Pulse steroid therapy lead to rapid renal function improvement and
   reduction in kidney size. Renal failure is a frequent manifestation of
   MM, which can affect kidneys in several ways. MM should be included in
   the differential diagnosis of every case of unexplained renal failure,
   especially in the elderly, even in the absence of an M spike in serum
   and urine electrophoresis.}},

Abstract = {{Infection is a major complication when utilizing implantable devices.
   The purpose of this study was to create a functionalized polyethylene
   terephthalate (polyester) biomaterial with sustained antimicrobial
   properties using textile-dyeing technology. Polyester was hydrolyzed via
   exposure to sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to provide two functional sites
   within the polymeric backbone. A modified textile dyeing technique known
   as thermofixation or pad-heating (pad-heat) in conjunction with
   autoclaving was employed to directly incorporate the fluoroquinolone
   antibiotic Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) into polyester fibers. Woven polyester
   segments were placed into various concentrations of boiling NaOH
   solutions to create carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups (HYD). The
   segments were then sprayed (padded) with a 5 mg mL(-1) Cipro solution
   and dried overnight, followed by exposure to intense heat and
   autoclaving. Untreated HYD, Cipro-dipped, and pad-heat-treated HYD
   segments were then washed under stringent conditions. The antimicrobial
   activity of the each material was determined via zone of inhibition.
   Untreated HYD controls had no antimicrobial activity at any of the time
   periods examined. Cipro-dipped HYD segments had no antimicrobial
   activity after 1 h. In contrast, antimicrobial activity for autoclaved,
   pad-heat-treated HYD segments persisted for 80 days (length of study).
   Autoclave usage prior to plating affected antimicrobial activity
   substantially. Additionally, varying hydrolysis concentrations did not
   significantly affect overall Cipro release. Thus, Cipro application to
   HYD polyester via thermofixation resulted in controlled, sustained
   antibiotic release over an extended period of time. The long-term
   infection resistance provided by this technique may address major
   problems of infection from which implantable devices suffer. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The melt rheology and thermal properties of polylactide (PLA)-based
   nanocomposite films that were prepared by solvent casting method with
   L-PLA, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and montmorillonite clay were studied.
   The neat PLA showed predominantly solid-like behavior (G' > G `) and the
   complex viscosity (eta{*}) decreased systematically as the temperature
   increased from 184 to 196 degrees C. The elastic modulus (G') of
   PLA/clay blend showed a significant improvement in the magnitude in the
   melt, while clay concentration was at 6\% wt or higher. At similar
   condition, PEG dramatically reduced dynamic modulii and complex
   viscosity of PLA/PEG blend as function of concentration. A nanocomposite
   blend of PLA/PEG/clay (74/20/6) when compared to the neat polymer and
   PLA/PEG blend exhibited intermediate values of elastic modulus (G') and
   complex viscosity (eta{*}) with excellent flexibility. Thermal analysis
   of different clay loading blends indicated that the melting temperature
   (T-m) and glass transition temperature (T-g) remained unaffected
   irrespective of clay concentration due to immobilization of polymer
   chain in the clay nanocomposite. PEG incorporation reduced the T-g and
   the T-m of the blends (PLA/PEG and PLA/PEG/clay) significantly, however,
   crystallinity increased in the similar condition. The transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) image of nanocomposite films indicated good
   compatibility between PLA and PEG, whereas clay was not thoroughly
   distributed in the PLA matrix and remained as clusters. The percent
   crystallinity obtained by X-ray was significantly higher than that of
   differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) data for PLA.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess the capability of small animal PET
   (SA-PET) devices to image four mice simultaneously to improve the
   throughput of SA-PET experiments in cancer research. A customized bed
   was designed to image up to four mice simultaneously. This bed can
   easily replace the bed provided by the manufacturer and is connected to
   an anaesthesia device. A mouse-sized phantom was imaged, mimicking
   simultaneous imaging of four mice with computation of recovery
   coefficients and spillover ratios (SORs). In addition, eight mice
   bearing subcutaneous tumours (human embryonal carcinoma, n=22 tumours)
   were simultaneously imaged in groups of four on an Inveon SA-PET scanner
   after injection of F-18-fluoro-(D)-glucose. Tumour activity (Bq/ml), as
   determined by the SA-PET, was compared with ex-vivo counting. For a 5-mm
   rod, recovery coefficients were 1.15 and 1.05 for a phantom imaged at
   the central field of view or off-centred on the customized bed,
   respectively. SORair and SORwater were 0.05 and 0.04 for a phantom
   imaged alone and 0.15 and 0.06 for a phantom imaged with three
   additional scatter sources, respectively. Correlation between SA-PET and
   ex- vivo quantification was good (r(2)=0.91, P<0.0001). The mean ratio
   of PET quantitative data and ex- vivo counting was equal to 0.9 (95\%
   confidence interval: 0.70-1.09). New generation SA-PET may be suitable
   for simultaneously imaging four tumour-bearing mice, although
   improvement in scatter correction efficiency appears necessary. The type
   of customized bed developed in this study could be easily adapted to
   other large-bore SA-PET scanners. Nucl Med Commun 31:851-858 (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Samples of trans-free vegetable ghee were made using palm oil/palm
   stearin/palm olein (PO/POs/POo) blends (set A) and using palm oil/palm
   stearin/palm kernel olein (PO/POs/PKOo) blends (set B). Palm stearin of
   iodine value (IV) 30 was used in this study. The products were evaluated
   for their physical and chemical properties. Changes in quality during
   storage were monitored during a period of 16 weeks. Most of the
   vegetable ghee were granular (grainy) and had a shiny appearance.
   Chemical analyses indicated that vegetable ghee consisting of PO/POs/POo
   had higher IV (47.7-52.4) than the PO/POs/PKOo vegetable ghee due to
   their higher content of unsaturated fatty acids, 46.0-50.0\% compared to
   36.6-45.0\% in Set B. Decreasing the amount of palm oil while increasing
   palm stearin in the formulations resulted in higher slip melting point
   (SMP) and higher yield values. Eutectic interaction was noted in
   PO/POs/PKOo blends. The crystals in samples PO/POs/POo (set A) were
   predominant in the beta' polymorphic form. One formulation in set B (B4)
   exhibited beta crystallinity. Free fatty acids (FFA) were lowest in
   samples PO/POs/POo 80:5:15 (A4) and PO/POs:/PKOo 80:5:15 (B4) throughout
   storage. There was no clear trend on anisidine value (AV) while IV
   remained almost constant. Selected vegetable ghee, A4 wasused to shallow

Abstract = {{BI-10773, being developed by Boehringer Ingelheim Corp, is a
   sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitor for the oral treatment
   of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Preclinical and clinical research
   has demonstrated that inhibition of SGLT2, the major pathway of renal
   glucose reabsorption, leads to increased urinary glucose excretion with
   concomitant reductions in fasting and postprandial plasma glucose
   levels, HbA1c levels and body mass. In phase I clinical trials in
   patients with T2DM, once-daily BI-10773 increased urinary glucose
   excretion resulting in dose-proportional reductions in fasting plasma
   glucose and mean daily glucose levels. BI-10773 was not associated with
   significant hypoglycemic episodes or other clinically important adverse
   events. Because of its mechanism of action, BI-10773 may be combined
   with other oral antidiabetic agents; indeed, the results of small trials
   suggested that coadministration of BI-10773 and metformin was safe and
   well tolerated. In animal studies, BI-10773 correlated with an increase
   in urinary volume and a reduction in body fat but not water content.
   This may represent an additional benefit of BI-10773 for the control of
   T2DM. At the time of publication, phase III clinical trials of BI-10773
   were underway.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to compare maxillary dentures having different
   reinforcing materials in terms of stress distribution under concentrated
   forces applied to anterior and posterior regions. For this purpose,
   stress analyses of finite element models of 3 mm thick maxillary
   denture-bone systems were performed by using ANSYS software. First,
   concentrated forces making various angles, such as 0 degrees, 15
   degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 75 degrees, and 90 degrees,
   with horizontal axis were applied to the anterior incisor and the
   posterior molar tooth regions of a maxillary denture without
   reinforcement material. The results show that the highest stress in
   critical zones occur at 75 degrees and 45 degrees angles, under loadings
   of 150N to molar and 75N to incisor region, respectively. Secondly, four
   different reinforcing materials including unidirectional and woven glass
   fibers, unidirectional carbon fibers, and alloyed chrome-cobalt fibers
   were placed in the denture in two different positions. Under vertical
   loadings, the sigma(x) stress distributions occurring in critical zones
   were investigated. It is concluded from the stress analyses that use of
   Cr-Co as a reinforcing material at the center of the maxillary denture
   gives the best results in terms of stress distribution and strength.}},

Abstract = {{Let G be a simple graph of order n. The domination polynomial of G is
   the polynomial D(G, x) = Sigma(n)(i=1) d(G, i)x(i), where d(G, i) is the
   number of dominating sets of G of size i. A root of D(G, x) is called a
   domination root of G. We denote the set of distinct domination roots by
   Z(D(G, x)). Two graphs G and H are said to D-equivalent, written as G
   similar to H, if D(G, x) = D(H, x). The D-equivalence class of G is
   {[}G] = \{H : H similar to G\}. A graph G is said to be D-unique if
   {[}G] = \{G\}. In this paper, we show that if a graph G has two distinct
   domination roots, then Z(D(G, x)) = \{-2, 0\}. Also, if G is a graph
   with no pendant vertex and has three distinct domination roots, then
   Z(D(G. x)) subset of \{0, -2 +/- root 2i, -3 +/-root 3i/2\}. Also, we
   study the D-equivalence classes of some certain graphs. It is shown that
   if n equivalent to 0, 2 (mod3), then C(n) is D-unique, and if n
   equivalent to 0 (mod 3), then {[}P(n)] consists of exactly two graphs.

   decays of B and D mesons}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The experimental prospects for precise measurements of the leptonic
   decays B-u -> tau nu/mu nu, B-s -> mu(+)mu(-), D -> mu nu and D-s -> mu
   nu/tau nu are very promising. Double ratios involving four of these
   decays can be defined in which the dependence on the values of the decay
   constants is essentially eliminated, thus enabling complementary
   measurements of the CKM matrix element V-ub with a small theoretical
   error. We quantify the experimental error in a possible future
   measurement of vertical bar V-ub vertical bar using this approach, and
   show that it is competitive with the anticipated precision from the
   conventional approaches. Moreover, it is shown that such double ratios
   can be more effective than the individual leptonic decays as a probe of
   the parameter space of supersymmetric models. We emphasize that the
   double ratios have the advantage of using vertical bar V-ub vertical bar
   as an input parameter (for which there is experimental information),
   while the individual decays have an uncertainty from the decay constants
   (e. g. f(Bs)), and hence a reliance on theoretical techniques such as
   lattice QCD.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The disruption of primary innate immune function of the
   epidermal layer of the skin accounts for the susceptibility of
   individuals using bleaching agents to localized or systemic infections.
   This subverted innate immunity in these people may lead to other
   pathological conditions. The resultant effects of skin bleaching and
   phagocytes activation in response to infections have not been studied in
   Nigerians using bleaching agents. The present study therefore assessed
   the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, total antioxidant
   potential (TAP), total plasma peroxides (TPP), oxidative stress index
   (OSI) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the users bleaching agents.
   Methodology: Thirty (30) people who had used bleaching agents for
   average of 4.9 +/- 1.2 years participated in this study. They were
   recruited from various schools and markets within the city of Ibaadan,
   Oyo State, Nigeria. Thirty apparently healthy staffs of University
   College Hospital Ibaadan, Ibaadan, Nigeria, who had never used bleaching
   agents served as controls. All the subjects used for this study had no
   metabolic abnormality and tested negative to both HIV and hepatitis B
   infections.
   Result: The mean value of TAP (p < 0.01) was significantly lower in
   individuals using bleaching agents when compared with the controls. The
   mean levels of CRP (p<0.01), TPP (p < 0.01), 051 (p<0.01) and MDA (p <
   0.05) were significantly higher in the users of bleaching agents when
   compared with the controls. But there was no significant difference in
   the mean value of albumin (p>0.20) when compared with the controls.
   Conclusion: Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation are possible
   consequences of skin bleaching. The users of skin bleaching agents may
   need antioxidant therapies to avert the risks of oxidative stress.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims at exploiting optimal configurations of technologies
   combined with co-generation theoretically based on a linear optimization
   model. With the objective function defining primary energy consumption

   describe the technological configurations as well as associated

   finding is that the essential parameters to determine the configurations
   are heat, cooling and steam demands normalized by power demand. The
   optimal solutions are also applied to investigate the competitiveness of
   co-generation related technologies. The optimal solutions yield critical
   conditions theoretically, which is useful to understand the priority of
   the technologies. A sensitivity analysis numerically indicates that
   absorption chillers can be superior to compression chillers even though
   the former has lower COP than the latter. Actual data of various types

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We introduce the equational notion of a monadic bounded algebra (MBA),
   intended to capture algebraic properties of bounded quantification. The
   variety of all MBA's is shown to be generated by certain algebras of
   two-valued propositional functions that correspond to models of monadic
   free logic with an existence predicate. Every MBA is a subdirect product
   of such functional algebras, a fact that can be seen as an algebraic
   counterpart to semantic completeness for monadic free logic. The
   analysis involves the representation of MBA's as powerset algebras of
   certain directed graphs with a set of ``marked{''} points.
   It is shown that there are only countably many varieties of MBA's, all
   are generated by their finite members, and all have finite equational
   axiomatisations classifying them into fourteen kinds of variety. The
   universal theory of each variety is decidable.
   Finitely generated MBA's are shown to be finite, with the free algebra
   on r generators having exactly 2(3.2r.2.2r-1) elements. An explicit
   procedure is given for constructing this freely generated algebra as the
   powerset algebra of a certain marked graph determined by the number r.}},

Abstract = {{Interworking UMTS and WiMAX networks offers global roaming and cost
   effective broadband wireless Internet access. Designing efficient Intra
   and Inter WiMAX handovers in the interworking architecture is a
   challenging problem. Handovers must be instantaneous and secure at the

   WiMAX handover protocols which are capable of operating in the
   UMTS-WiMAX interworking architecture and perform mutual
   pre-authentication between the mobile station and the target network
   prior to handover. Due to the pre-authentication procedure, our proposed
   handover protocols outperform standard handover protocols by dispatching
   fewer handover signaling messages, experiencing less handover delay and
   preserving computation resources of critical nodes in the interworking
   architecture. Furthermore, our proposed handover protocols meet
   essential security requirements and defend against common attacks

   mu m after 3 days and between 26.11 and 32.43 mu m after 5 days. With
   the exception of Ti-m the biofilm thickness after 3 days was correlated
   with surface roughness. In addition to Streptococcus spp. as the main
   component of the biofilm (11.23-25.30\%), F. nucleatum, A. naeslundii,
   and Veillonella spp. were also detected. No significant differences in
   biofilm composition on the implant surfaces could be observed. In total,
   the influence of roughness and material on biofilm formation was
   compensated by biofilm maturation. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

   Methods. We conducted a retrospective review of patients with MPE
   treated at the Montreal Children's Hospital/McGill University Health
   Centre between 1985 and 2008 Results. Seven children under the age of 18
   were diagnosed and treated for MPE All patients were treated with
   surgery to the primary site Three patients underwent subtotal resection
   (STR) and received adjuvant post-operative RI Only one patient who had
   spinal drop metastases received post-operative RI to the lumbosacral
   region following complete resection of the primary tumor After a median
   follow up of 78 months (range 24-180 months), all patients were alive
   with controlled disease The single patient treated with gross total
   resection (GTR) and adjuvant local radiation remained recurrence free
   One of the three patients treated with STR and adjuvant RI had disease
   progression that was controlled with re-resection and further RT Two of
   the three patients treated with surgery alone developed local and
   disseminated recurrent spinal disease that was controlled by salvage RI
   Conclusion. Our data support the evolving literature which suggests that
   GTR alone provides suboptimal disease control in MPE In our patients, RT
   resulted in control of residual, metastatic and/or recurrent disease
   Routine adjuvant RI may improve outcomes in pediatric MPE Pediatr Blood

Abstract = {{Upon fertilization, the zygotic genome is activated. To ensure the
   transcription of specific genes and avoid promiscuous gene expression, a
   chromatin-mediated repressive state is established. To characterize
   potential heterochromatin factors present during the first cleavage, two
   putative transcriptional repressors, zinc finger protein (ZFP1) and
   ZFP54, belonging to the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc finger
   family, were isolated. ZFP1 and ZFP54 contain an N-terminally located
   KRAB repressor domain followed by 8 and 12 repeats of Kruppel
   zinc-finger motifs, respectively. Reverse transcription (RT) and
   quantitative (q) PCR show that maternally contributed Zfp1 and Zfp54
   mRNA are detected throughout preimplantation development.
   alpha-Amanitin-treated zygotes revealed that maternal Zfp1 and Zfp54 are
   fully degraded at the two-cell stage. Microinjections of in
   vitro-transcribed mRNA encoding a gfp-fused reporter gene into zygotes
   demonstrated the intracellular distribution of ZFP1-green fluorescent
   protein (GFP) and ZFP54-GFP colocalized with a DNA marker in the
   two-cell embryo. The KRAB domain was essential to colocalize with DNA,
   and deletion of the KRAB domain in ZFP1-GFP and ZFP54-GFP localized in
   nucleoli and in a ubiquitously manner, respectively. Taken together,
   this suggests a role for ZFP1 and ZFP54 in transcriptional regulation in
   early development.}},

Title = {{ACCESS Acute Cerebrovascular Care in Emergency Stroke Systems}},
Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1210-1218}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Our primary objective was to determine the proportion of the
   population able to achieve acute cerebrovascular care in emergency
   stroke systems (ACCESS) in the United States. In addition, we examined
   how policy changes, including allowing ground ambulances to cross state
   lines and allowing air ambulances to transport patients from the
   prehospital setting to primary stroke centers (PSCs), would affect
   population access to stroke care.
   Design: Data were obtained via the US Census Bureau, The Joint
   Commission, and the Atlas and Database of Air Medical Services. Driving
   distances, ambulance driving speeds, and prehospital times were
   estimated using validated models and adjusted for population density.
   Access was determined by summing the population that could reach a PSC
   within the specified time intervals.
   Setting/Participants: US population.
   Main Outcome Measures: Thirty-, 45-, and 60-minute access by ground and
   air ambulance to PSCs.
   Results: Fewer than 1 in 4 Americans (22.3\%) have access to a PSC
   within 30 minutes, less than half (43.2\%) have access within 45
   minutes, and just over half (55.4\%) have access within 60 minutes. The
   use of air ambulances to deliver patients to PSCs would increase access
   from 22.3\% to 26.0\% for 30 minutes, 43.2\% to 65.5\% for 45 minutes,
   and from 55.4\% to 79.3\% for 60 minutes. The combination of prehospital
   regionalization and air ambulance transport of patients with acute
   stroke would reduce the 135.7 million Americans without 60-minute access
   to a PSC by half, to 62.9 million.
   Conclusions: About half of the US population has timely access to a PSC.
   The use of air ambulances to triage patients with ischemic stroke to a
   PSC would increase the percentage of the US population with prompt
   access to stroke care. These data have implications for the ongoing
   design of the US stroke system.}},

Abstract = {{Consumption of fresh-cut produce has sharply increased recently causing
   an increase of foodborne illnesses associated with these products. As
   generally, acidic fruits are considered `safe' from a microbiological
   point of view, the aim of this work was to study the growth and survival
   of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella and Listeria innocua on
   minimally-processed peaches. The three foodborne pathogens population
   increased more than 2 log(10) units on fresh-cut peach when stored at 20
   and 25 degrees C after 48 h. At 10 degrees C only L innocua grew more
   than 1 log(10) unit and it was the only pathogen able to grow at 5
   degrees C. Differences in growth occurred between different peach
   varieties tested, with higher population increases in those varieties
   with higher pH ('Royal Glory' 4.73 +/- 0.25 and `Diana' 4.12 +/- 0.18).
   The use of common strategies on extending shelf life of fresh-cut
   produce, as modified atmosphere packaging and the use of the antioxidant
   substance, ascorbic acid (2\% w/v), did not affect pathogens' growth at
   any of the temperatures tested (5 and 25 degrees C). Minimally-processed
   peaches have shown to be a good substrate for foodborne pathogens'
   growth regardless use of modified atmosphere and ascorbic acid.
   Therefore, maintaining cold chain and avoiding contamination is highly
   necessary. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We focused our attention on brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), the ATPase
   subunit of the SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin
   remodeling complex, and analyzed its role in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)
   biology. We hypothesized that deviation from the correct concentration
   of these proteins, which act at the highest level of gene regulation,
   may be deleterious for cells. We wanted to know what would happen if a
   cell had to cope with altered regulation of gene expression, either by
   upregulation or downregulation of BRG1. We assumed that cells would try
   to restore homeostasis or, alternatively, that the event could trigger
   senescence/apoptosis phenomena. To this end, in MSCs, we silenced
   BRG1gene. Knockdown of BRG1 expression induced a significant increase in
   senescent cells and decrease in apoptotic cells. It is interesting that
   BRG1 downregulation also induced an increase in heterochromatin. At the
   molecular level, these phenomena were associated with activation of
   retinoblastoma-like protein 2 (RB2)/P130-and P53-related pathways.
   Senescence was accompanied by reduced expression of some
   stemness-related genes. This is consistent with our previous research,
   which showed that BRG1 upregulation by ectopic expression also induced
   senescence processes. Together, these data suggest that BRG1 belongs to
   a class of genes whose expression is tightly regulated; hence, subtle
   alterations in BRG1 activity seem to negatively affect mechanisms
   regulating chromatin status and, in turn, impair cellular physiology.

Abstract = {{Capacity building is often described as fundamental to the success of
   health alliances, yet there are few evaluations that provide alliances
   with clear guidance on the challenges related to capacity building. This
   article attempts to identify potential challenges of capacity building
   in multistakeholder health alliances. The study uses a multiple case
   study design to identify potential challenges and trade-offs associated
   with capacity building in four community health alliances in the United
   States. Multiple challenges were found to be common across the four
   alliances, including specifying appropriate governance structures and
   decision-making frameworks, aligning stakeholder interests with the
   vision of the alliance, balancing short-term objectives with long-term
   goals, and securing resources to sustain the effort without compromising
   it. These challenges often involved trade-offs and choices that
   alliances need to prepare for if they are to approach capacity building
   in a planful rather than a reactive manner.}},

Abstract = {{P>The in vitro and in vivo fungicidal activity of chitosan was studied
   against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, the causal agent of anthracnose
   in papaya fruits. Chitosan at 1.5\% and 2.0\% concentrations showed a
   fungistatic effect with 90-100\% inhibition (significant at P < 0.05) of
   the fungal mycelial growth. Changes in the conidial morphology were also
   observed with the higher chitosan concentrations after 7- h incubation.
   In vivo studies showed that 1.5\% and 2.0\% chitosan coatings on papaya
   not only controlled the fruit decay but also delayed the onset of
   disease symptoms by 3-4 weeks during 5 weeks storage at 12 +/- 1 degrees
   C and slowed down the subsequent disease development. However, when
   leaving the fruits to ripen at ambient temperature (28 +/- 2 degrees C),
   2.0\% chitosan was less effective than 1.5\% in controlling the disease
   development. Chitosan coatings also delayed the ripening process by
   maintaining the firmness levels, soluble solids concentration and
   titratable acidity values during and after storage.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To estimate the frequency and character of oral mucosal
   lesions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
   erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. Furthermore, the relation between
   oral mucosal involvement and hyposalivation was investigated. Design:
   Case-control study. Setting: Rheumatology Clinic, University Hospital
   ``Mother Theresa{''} in Tirana, Albania. Participants: 124 consecutive
   hospitalised patients (88 with rheumatoid arthritis, 22 with systemic
   lupus erythematosus and 14 with systemic sclerosis) and 124 age- and
   gender- matched healthy controls. Methods: Oral lesions were clinically
   examined and classified according to their morphologic aspects and
   localisation. Examination included also measurement of unstimulated
   whole salivary flow. Main outcome measures: Frequency of oral mucosal
   lesions and hyposalivation. Results: Oral mucosal lesions were observed
   in 58.9\% of patients, but in only 33.1\% of control subjects. Clinical
   aspects of lesions varied, and palate, buccal and labial mucosa, and
   tongue were the most affected sites. No significant associations were
   found between presence of oral lesions and hyposalivation, except oral
   candidosis which was associated with hyposalivation in controls.
   Conclusions: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
   erythematosus and systemic sclerosis have a higher burden of oral mucosa
   disease than a healthy population. Collaboration of rheumatology and
   oral medicine units should allow appropriate management of these
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Nine isoenergetic (18.5 kJ g-1) diets were formulated in a 3 x 3
   factorial design to contain three protein levels (350, 400 and 450 g

   Temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) were maintained within the
   range 28-30 degrees C, 5.6-6.8 and 4.82-6.65 mg L-1 respectively
   throughout. Results show that fish survival was better in the groups fed
   65 g kg-1 lipid while growth performance (\% weight gain, WG; specific
   growth rate, SGR) and nutrient utilization (feed conversion ratio, FCR;
   protein efficiency ratio, PER; protein intake, PI) in the 65/450 and
   90/450 g kg-1 treatments were similar and significantly (P < 0.05)
   higher than in fish fed the other lipid/protein ratio combinations. The
   body indices monitored (Hepatosomatic index, HSI and viscerosomatic
   index, VSI) were similar among the treatments whereas intestinal lipase

Abstract = {{Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on three strains of
   an acetogenic bacterium isolated from livestock-impacted soil. The
   bacterium stained Gram-negative and was a non-spore-forming rod that was
   motile by peritrichous flagella. The novel strains had an optimum pH for
   growth of 8.0-8.5 and utilized H-2 : CO2, CO : CO2, glucose, fructose,
   mannose, turanose, ribose, trimethylamine, pyruvate, methanol, ethanol,
   n-propanol and n-butanol as growth substrates. Acetate was produced from
   glucose. Acetate, CO2 and ethanol were produced from CO : CO2. 16S rRNA
   gene sequence analysis indicated that the novel strains formed a new
   subline in the family Eubacteriaceae (rRNA cluster XV) of the low
   G+C-containing Gram-positive bacteria of the class Clostridia. The DNA G
   + C base composition was 34 mol\%. Cell wall analysis revealed the
   existence of a novel B-type peptidoglycan similar to the B2 alpha-type
   (B4) configuration with a variation containing aspartic acid. Based on
   phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the new
   isolates represent a novel genus and species, for which the name
   Alkalibaculum bacchi gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of
   the type species is CP11(T) (= ATCC BAA-1772(T)=DSM 22112(T)).}},

Abstract = {{We address the intrinsic multimode nature of the quantum state of light
   obtained by pulsed spontaneous parametric downconversion and develop a
   theoretical model based only on experimentally accessible quantities. We
   exploit the pairwise entanglement as a resource for conditional
   multimode measurements and derive closed formulas for the detection
   probability and the density matrix of the conditional states. We present
   a set of experiments performed to validate our model in different
   conditions that are in excellent agreement with experimental data.
   Finally, we evaluate the non-Gaussianity of the conditional states
   obtained from our source with the aim of discussing the effects of the
   different experimental parameters on the effectiveness of this type of
   conditional state preparation. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2010}},

Abstract = {{Acinetobacter baumannii is a frequent cause of nosocomial infections in
   most hospitals. Management of infections caused by these strains is
   difficult, as the strains often display multiple drug resistance,
   including carbapenem. Tigecycline which is a glycylcycline derivative
   has antimicrobial activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative
   organisms. In this study, in vitro activity of tigecycline and
   carbapenems against clinical isolates of A.baumannii strains were
   investigated. A total of 100 A.baumannii isolates were collected from
   hospitalized patients with documented nosocomial infections {[}pneumonia
   (n= 39), surgical wound infection (n= 32), bacteremia (n= 16), catheter
   infection (n= 6), urinary tract infection (n= 5), peritonitis (n= 1),
   eye infection (n= 1)] between October 2006 and June 2007. Only one
   isolate per patient was included to the study. Minimum inhibitory
   concentrations (MIC) of tigecycline were determined by E-test (AB
   Biodisk, Sweden). Carbapenem resistance of A.baumannii strains were
   determined by disk diffusion method. All of the 100 A.baumannii isolates
   (100\%) were found susceptible to tigecycline (MIC values <= 2 mu g/ml;
   MIC ranges: 0.032-1.5 mu g/ml). Imipenem susceptibility test was
   performed for 95 strains, and 36 (37.9\%) were found sensitive, 18
   (18.9\%) were intermediate sensitive, and 41 (43.2\%) were resistant.
   Meropenem susceptibility test was performed for 87 strains, and 22
   (25.3\%) were found sensitive, 9 (10.3\%) were intermediate sensitive,
   and 56 (64.4\%) were resistant. Since tigecycline is found quite
   effective on nosocomial A.baumannii isolates, it may be considered as a
   treatment alternative in infections caused by carbapenem-resistant
   Acinetobacter spp.}},

Abstract = {{Defects in the function of mismatch repair (MMR) genes result in genetic

   conducted to determine the frequency of genetic instability {[}defined

   deficiency in MMR genes in renal cortical tumors. A total of 51
   surgically-resected renal tumors (27 clear cell, 10 papillary, 5
   chromophobe carcinomas and 9 oncocytomas) were studied. We also analyzed
   the correlation with clinicopathological parameters, the MSI status
   (assessed by using 5 microsatellite markers: D2S123, D11S904, D3S1621,
   D3S1683 and BAT26), and the immunohistochemical expression of 2 major
   MMR genes {[}the human mutL homolog 1 (hMLHI) and the human mutS homolog
   2 (hMSH2)]. Sixteen cases (31.4\%) showed MSI: Three (5.9\%)
   demonstrated a high level of MSI, 11 (21.6\%) demonstrated a low level
   of MSI, 2 (3.9\%) presented with a loss of heterozygosity, and the
   remaining 35 (68.6\%) exhibited microsatellite stability. The loss of
   hMLH1 and hMSH2 immunohistochemical expressions was observed in 5/51
   (9.8\%) and 9/51 (17.6\%) cases, respectively. The complete absence of
   both hMLH1 and hMSH2 immunohistochemical expressions was observed only
   in the 3 cases with a high level of MSI. This study showed that defects

Abstract = {{Purpose: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is standard treatment to decrease
   tumor recurrence and delay progression of high risk, nonmuscle invasive
   bladder tumors. However, it is not yet clear which T1G3 cases are more
   prone to more aggressive clinical behavior or susceptible to respond to
   bacillus Calmette-Guerin. We evaluated the role of myopodin methylation
   as a clinical outcome prognosticator and predictive biomarker for the
   bacillus Calmette-Guerin response in patients with T1G3 bladder tumors.
   Materials and Methods: We analyzed the methylation status of myopodin in
   tumor specimens from 170 patients with T1G3 bladder cancer, including a
   subset of 108 who underwent bacillus Calmette-Guerin treatment. Myopodin
   methylation was assessed by methylation specific polymerase chain
   reactions. Recurrence, progression to muscle invasive tumors and disease
   specific overall survival were analyzed using competing risks regression
   analysis.
   Results: Of the 170 cases analyzed 72 recurred (42.4\%) and 36
   progressed (21.2\%). A total of 24 patients (14.1\%) died of the
   disease. Univariate and multivariate survival analysis revealed that
   myopodin methylation was significantly associated with an increased
   recurrence rate (p = 0.004), progression (p = 0.002) and shorter disease
   specific overall survival (p = 0.020). In a subset treated with bacillus
   Calmette-Guerin myopodin methylation was also related to an increased
   recurrence rate (p = 0.011), progression (p = 0.030) and shorter disease
   specific overall survival (p = 0.028).
   Conclusions: Epigenetic analysis revealed that myopodin methylation was
   associated with tumor aggressiveness and clinical outcome in patients
   with T1G3 disease. Myopodin methylation distinguished patients
   responding to bacillus Calmette-Guerin from those who may require a more
   aggressive therapeutic approach.}},

Abstract = {{Alteration on physical characteristics of the soil decurrent from
   application of treated domestic sewage. This study examined the
   alteration on physical characteristics of the soil decurrent from
   application of treated domestic sewage. The randomized blocks design was
   used with three replicates. The soil of the experimental area is
   Cambissolo; the topography is rugged; the climate is Cwb with rainy
   summer and cold and dry winter; the applications of the domestic sewage
   were via drip irrigation system. The treatments were: T non-irrigated
   soil; MC - soil with application of clean water; and MR - soil with
   application of treated domestic sewage. Soil samples were collected in
   the layers of 0 to 0.20, 0.20 to 0.40, and 0.40 to 0.60 m for physical
   analysis (bulk density, microporosity, macroporosity, field capacity,
   wilting point and hydraulic conductivity). The results evidenced that MC
   and MR increased the bulk density, microporosity and field capacity,
   however diminished the macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity of the
   soil in relation to the T.}},

Abstract = {{In the distributed linear source coding problem, a set of distributed
   sensors observe subsets of a data vector with noise, and provide the
   fusion center linearly encoded data. The goal is to determine the
   encoding matrix of each sensor such that the fusion center can
   reconstruct the entire data vector with minimum mean square error. The
   recently proposed local Karhunen-Loeve transform approach performs this
   task by optimally determining the encoding matrix of each sensor
   assuming the other matrices are fixed. This approach is implemented
   iteratively until convergence is reached. Herein, we propose a greedy
   algorithm. In each step, one of the encoding matrices is updated by
   appending an additional row. The algorithm selects in a greedy fashion a
   single sensor that provides the largest improvement in minimizing the
   mean square error. This algorithm terminates after a finite number of
   steps, that is, when all the encoding matrices reach their predefined
   encoded data size. We show that the algorithm can be implemented
   recursively, and compared to the iterative approach, the algorithm
   reduces the computational load from cubic dependency to quadratic
   dependency on the data size. This makes it a prime candidate for on-line
   and real-time implementations of the distributed Karhunen-Loeve
   transform. Simulation results suggest that the mean square error
   performance of the suggested algorithm is equivalent to the iterative
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{The survival of microorganisms over extended time frames in frozen
   subsurface environments may be limited by chemical (i.e., via hydrolysis
   and oxidation) and ionizing radiation-induced damage to chromosomal DNA.
   In an effort to improve estimates for the survival of bacteria in icy
   terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments, we determined rates of
   macromolecular synthesis at temperatures down to -15 degrees C in
   bacteria isolated from Siberian permafrost (Psychrobacter cryohalolentis
   K5 and P. arcticus 273-4) and the sensitivity of P. cryohalolentis to
   ionizing radiation. Based on experiments conducted over approximate to
   400 days at -15 degrees C, the rates of protein and DNA synthesis in P.
   cryohalolentis were <1 to 16 proteins cell(-1) d(-1) and 83 to 150 base
   pairs (bp) cell(-1) d(-1), respectively; P. arcticus synthesized DNA at
   rates of 20 to 1625 bp cell(-1) d(-1) at -15 degrees C under the
   conditions tested. The dose of ionizing radiation at which 37\% of the
   cells survive (D-37) of frozen suspensions of P. cryohalolentis was 136
   Gy, which was similar to 2-fold higher (71 Gy) than identical samples
   exposed as liquid suspensions. Laboratory measurements of {[}H-3]
   thymidine incorporation demonstrate the physiological potential for DNA
   metabolism at -15 degrees C and suggest a sufficient activity is
   possible to offset chromosomal damage incurred in near-subsurface
   terrestrial and martian permafrost. Thus, our data imply that the
   longevity of microorganisms actively metabolizing within permafrost
   environments is not constrained by chromosomal DNA damage resulting from
   ionizing radiation or entropic degradation over geological time.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims It is recognized that overt thyroid dysfunction is
   associated with weight changes, but the influence of a minor alteration
   of thyroid function remains unclear This study aimed to further
   investigate the relation ship between obesity and thyroid function and
   to examine the possible role of insulin resistance on the hypothalamic
   pituitary thyroid axis Methods and results Serum TSH and free T-4 (FT4)
   levels anthropometric and metabolic parameters were evaluated in 581
   obese patients In all patients TSH values progressively increased
   according to the severity of obesity and were positively correlated with
   body mass index (p=0 001 r=0 13) and waist circumference (p=0 02, r=0
   11) Patients with insulin resistance showed higher TSH (1 8 +/- 1 0 vs 1
   6 +/- 0 9 mu Ul/l, p=0 03) and lower FT4 levels (13 8 +/- 2 3 vs 15 0
   +/- 2 2 pmol/l, p < 0 001) as compared with patients with normal insulin
   sensitivity Moreover TSH was positively cor related with fasting insulin
   (p < 0 001 r=0 152) and home stasis model assessment of insulin
   resistance (HOMA IR p < 0 001 r=0 148), and negatively correlated with
   Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICK!, p < 0 001 r=-0
   148) FT4 was negatively associated with fasting insulin (p < 0 001, r=-0
   287) and HOMA IR (p < 0 001, r=-0 295), and positively associated with
   QUICKI (p < 0 001 r=0 295) Conclusions A relationship between thyroid
   function and over weight/obesity condition seems to exist, mainly
   influenced by insulin resistance Whether variations in TSH and/or
   thyroid hormones, within a normal range, can influence body weight or
   whether obesity per se can alter thyroid function cannot be stated so
   far Further studies are needed to assess the link between thyroid
   function and body weight by considering not only changes in thyroid

   author examines the history of Foucault's personal and scholarly

   Foucault's critique of psychoanalysis can be extended to the

Abstract = {{Austempered ductile iron (ADI) is a material that exhibits excellent
   mechanical properties because of its special microstructure, combining
   ferrite and austenite supersaturated with carbon. Two ADI alloys, Fe-3.5
   pct C-2.5 pct Si and Fe-3.6 pct C-2.7 pct Si-0.7 pct Cu, austempered for
   various times at 623 K (350 degrees C) and 673 K (400 degrees C)
   followed by water quenching, were investigated. The first ferrite
   needles nucleate mainly at the graphite/austenite interface. The
   austenite and ferrite weight fractions increase with the austempering
   time until stabilization is reached. The increase in the lattice
   parameter of the austenite during austempering corresponds to an
   increase of carbon content in the austenite. The increase in the ferrite
   weight fraction is associated with a decrease in microhardness. As the
   austempering temperature increases, the ferrite weight fraction
   decreases, the high carbon austenite weight fraction increases, but the
   carbon content in the latter decreases. Copper addition increases the
   high carbon austenite weight fraction. The results are discussed based
   on the phases composing the Fe-2Si-C system.}},

Title = {{Converting Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ),
   Multidimensional HAQ, and HAQII Scores Into Original HAQ Scores Using
   Models Developed With a Large Cohort of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index
   (HAQ) is the gold standard functional status questionnaire in
   rheumatology, but it is lengthy. Three shorter versions, the modified
   HAQ (MHAQ), the Multidimensional HAQ (MDHAQ), and the HAQII are often
   used in outcomes research as HAQ substitutes. We developed conversion
   formulas between these modified versions and the original HAQ.
   Methods. Analysis was limited to the comparison of rheumatoid arthritis
   (RA) patients at a random observation when the HAQ was recorded in
   conjunction with the MHAQ (n = 29,596), the MDHAQ (n = 13,665), or the
   HAQII (n = 15,823). Development models were randomly limited to 80\% of
   the data (development sample) and the remaining 20\% was used for model
   validation.
   Results. Two conversion formulas were developed for each of the MHAQ,
   the MDHAQ, and the HAQII: a short model and a long model inclusive of
   questions common to both the modified measures and the original HAQ.
   Short models explained 81-83\%, and long models 82-86\%, of the
   variance. Predicted HAQ values of zero were assigned to all cases with
   an MDHAQ or HAQII score of zero, with remaining cases used for model
   estimation. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated good concordance between
   actual and predicted values for each measure. The validation sample
   closely approximated the results from the development sample (0.005 <=
   Delta R-2 <= 0.009) for each measure.
   Conclusion. We have developed and validated highly accurate conversion
   formulas from the MHAQ, MDHAQ, and HAQII to the original HAQ in a large
   sample of RA patients. The developed models are useful for conversion of
   measures in the research setting. Because of substantial variability at
   the individual patient level, application of the formulas to individual
   patients is inadvisable.}},

   Prognostic implications in hypertensive post-menopausal women}},
Journal = {{MATURITAS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{159-165}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although repolarization abnormalities on ECG are frequent in
   post-menopausal hypertensive women, their prognostic value in these
   women is uncertain.
   Methods: We analyzed 908 hypertensive post-menopausal women
   consecutively included in the PIUMA (Progetto Ipertensione Umbria
   Monitoraggio Ambulatoriale) study. The median duration of follow-up was
   8.6 years (range: 1-21). All women were untreated at entry. Drug
   treatment during follow-up was adjusted to single individuals. Standard
   12-lead ECG was carried out at entry. The Minnesota Coding was used to
   define minor and major ({''}typical strain{''}) repolarization
   abnormalities.
   Design: prospective observational study in essential hypertension.
   Results: Mean age at entry was 60 years. At baseline, ECG was normal in
   707 women, minor ST-T changes were noted in 152 women, and a typical
   strain pattern was present in 49 subjects. Predictors of typical strain
   were age, diabetes and systolic blood pressure (BP). During follow-up
   there were 119 new cardiovascular (CV) events and 75 all-cause deaths.
   Typical strain was associated with a threefold higher risk of CV disease
   (HR: 3.16; 95\% Cl; 1.59-6.31; p = 0.001) after adjustment for the
   significant influence of age, diabetes, serum creatinine, systolic BP
   and HDL-cholesterol. Women with minor LV repolarization abnormalities
   showed a non-significant excess risk of CV disease when compared with
   women with normal LV repolarization (HR: 1.25; 95\% Cl; 0.69-2.26; p =
   0.467). Similar results were obtained for all-cause mortality.
   Conclusions: Typical strain pattern, an easily detectable marker of
   altered LV repolarization, identifies post-menopausal hypertensive women
   at increased risk of CV disease and all-cause mortality. (C) 2010

   reared in hapas in December 2008, fed on pellet feed and grown to an
   average size of 28 g and 135 mm in 60 days, with a survival rate of
   60\%. Subsequently, the juveniles were stocked into the cages at a
   stocking rate of 60 nos. m(-3) in February 2009, fed on trash fish and
   reared for a period of 112 days during which they grew to an average
   size of 540 g and 328 mm. Weight gain per day increased from 0.2 g in
   December 2008 to 7.71 g in May 2009, while SGR decreased from 5.88 to
   2.47. The hydrological parameters viz., temperature, pH, salinity,
   dissolved oxygen and microbial load recorded were at optimal levels for
   the normal growth of seabass. The results obtained indicated that cage
   culture of seabass in the sea can provide significant advantages in
   terms of faster growth and effective utilisation of water volume.}},

Abstract = {{There are an estimated three million migrant and seasonal farmworkers
   (MSFW) in the United States. In addition to the inherent dangers of farm
   work, numerous factors place MSFW at even greater risk for work-related
   injuries. Little is known about how MSFW care for work-related injuries,
   and how the decision to seek professional care is made. A prospective
   survey using face-to-face structured interviews was used to explore the
   type and frequency of occupational injuries as well as self-care and
   health-care seeking practices of MSFW. Musculoskeletal injuries were the
   most commonly reported injuries, followed by injuries of the skin and
   chemical exposure. Self care with over-the-counter remedies was the
   predominant method of dealing with injuries, and, with the exception of
   chemical exposure, was found to be for the most part, appropriate. The
   reported use of alternative medicine or herbal remedies was low. Future
   research efforts should focus on ergonomic modifications and farmworker
   education to reduce or prevent musculoskeletal injuries. The number of
   reported chemical exposures and inappropriate treatment draw attention
   to the need for continued efforts for both primary prevention of
   exposure and optimal treatment once exposure occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Tracheal intubation in patients with suspected neck injuries
   should achieve two contradicting goals-sufficient laryngeal exposure and
   the least cervical spine movement. Because the former involves
   displacements of the cervical vertebrae, intubation under immobilization
   is widely performed today to prevent exacerbation of spinal code
   injuries. The unique curving blade of the Airway Scope (AWS) is designed
   to fit the oropharyngeal anatomy. A camera at the tip of the blade
   displays the view of the larynx, but unlike the direct laryngoscope, it
   needs no line-of-sight of the oral, pharyngeal, and tracheal axis. Our
   purpose is to determine whether AWS could be a suitable airway device
   for the intubation of patients with potential neck injury.
   Methods: Thirty-six patients scheduled for surgery were randomly
   assigned to undergo intubation using either AWS or Macintosh
   laryngoscope (MLS). After general anesthetic induction, the patient's
   head was set in a neutral position, and an appropriately sized
   semi-rigid neck collar was placed. Measurements include intubation time,
   number of attempts, success rate, Cormack-Lehane classification, airway
   optimization maneuver, Intubation Difficulty Scale scores, and
   complications.
   Results: Intubation time proved no statistical significance (mean +/-
   SD, AWS, 62.9 seconds +/- 26.0 seconds, MLS, 55.6 seconds +/- 26.0
   seconds; p = 0.42). AWS scored less in Cormack-Lehane classification
   (median {[}range], AWS I {[}I-I], MLS IIIa {[}I-IIIb]; p < 0.0001),
   required fewer additional airway optimization maneuvers (p = 0.0003),
   and scored less in Intubation Difficulty Scale scores (AWS 0 {[}0-1],
   MLS 2 {[}0-5]; p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: In neck-immobilized patients using semi-rigid cervical
   collars, AWS improves laryngeal exposure and facilitates tracheal
   intubation. AWS may be a suitable intubation device for trauma patients.}},

Abstract = {{Patulin is a mycotoxin produced by fungi that contaminate fruits,

   polyurethane-beta-cyclodextrin polymers were evaluated for the ability

   isotherm analysis determined the polymers possess a degree of
   heterogeneity. Evaluation of the polymers by solid phase extraction
   analysis indicated patulin sorption is enhanced in aqueous environments.
   Polymers crosslinked with tolylene 2,4-diisocyanate were suitable for
   extraction of patulin from apple juice. Quantum chemical studies of the
   interactions of patulin and beta-cylcodextrin using the PM3
   semi-empirical method infer patulin is capable of binding to the polymer
   in multiple modes. Certain of these bound complexes possess
   intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions between the primary hydroxyls
   of beta-cyclodextrin and patulin. These nanoporous cyclodextrin polymers
   exhibit favorable properties to assist the detection of patulin in

Abstract = {{Background: The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a
   multiligand receptor expressed in a number of cell types, including
   gingival epithelia. RAGE mediates inflammation and induces cellular
   oxidative stress. Upregulation of RAGE is associated with various
   diseases, such as periodontal and cardiovascular diseases. This study
   examines the hypothesis that the gingiva of rats fed a
   calorie-restriction (CR) diet expresses lower levels of RAGE than the
   gingiva of rats fed an ad libitum (AL) diet.
   Methods: Male F344BN rats (n = 16) from the National Institute on Aging
   (NIA) were fed a CR (n = 8) or AL (n = 8) diet according to NIA
   recommendations. Rats were sacrificed by guillotine at 8 (n = 5), 18 (n
   = 3), 29 (n = 4), and 38 (n = 4) months of age. The gingiva from around
   the molars was dissected and submitted for histologic and molecular
   analyses.
   Results: Immunohistochemistry revealed that RAGE was expressed in the
   plasma membrane and cytoplasm of gingival epithelial cells and
   endothelial cells from both groups. RAGE mRNA levels were quantified
   relative to levels of GAPDH mRNA by real-time reverse-transcriptase
   polymerase chain reaction. The mean relative RAGE mRNA level in the CR
   group (7.26 +/- 0.54) was lower than in the AL group (10 +/- 1.4) (P <
   0.05). There were no detectable differences in RAGE expression according
   to animal age.
   Conclusion: Gingival RAGE expression in rats is reduced by calorie
   restriction. J Periodontol 2010;81:1481-1487.}},

Abstract = {{Alcohol dependence prevention measures were implemented at a Japanese

   health nurse interviewed each employee twice a year, providing guidance
   about reducing daily alcohol consumption and binge drinking. These
   nursing interventions were evaluated through individual employee health
   examinations conducted in 2000 and 2007 The examinations revealed that
   fewer employees drank alcohol in 2007 than in 2000 (8.4\% and 11 6\%,
   respectively) Employees who drank at least 1,500 milliliters of alcohol
   daily decreased from 13 7\% to 7.0\% (p = 004) By gathering case
   studies, the effectiveness of the occupational health nursing

Abstract = {{In the last three years, the development of a profound reorganization of
   university teachings has made it possible to comply with the commitments
   of the Declaration of Bologna and to adapt all teaching to the new
   structure of the degree program that will be introduced in October 2010.
   Along these lines (Order ECl/332/2008), the requirements that must be
   fulfilled by the university degrees to be able to practice the medical
   profession have been established. In the new study plans, acquisition of
   skills by the students is given priority and emphasis is placed on the
   learning methods of these skills, and on the procedures to evaluate
   their acquisition. The European Credit Transfer System (ACTS), (between
   25 and 30h), is the measurement unit that reflects the learning results.
   Furthermore, acquisition of clinical skills is promoted through the
   obligatory performance of pre-professional practices, in form of a
   period of independent clinical rotation and with a final evaluation of
   the skills, in health care centers, hospitals, and other care centers.
   In the upcoming years, it will be verified if this curriculum
   modernization of the study plans improves the professional practice of
   the new physicians. (C) 2010 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pain and symptoms of depression and anxiety have been observed to
   co-exist in the community-dwelling elderly. While depression and pain
   have been suggested to be predictive of one another temporally, the
   longitudinal associations between anxiety and pain remain undefined. The
   aim of this study was to investigate the reciprocal longitudinal
   associations of self-reported pain interference and affective symptoms,
   as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, in
   community-dwelling older adults and report the potentially modifying
   effect of co-morbid anxiety or depression on these relationships. The
   study population were adults aged over 50-years, recruited previously to
   the North Staffordshire Osteoarthritis project (NorStOP), who had
   returned a health survey at both baseline and 3-year follow-up (n =
   4234). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the pain-affect
   associations, with associations expressed as odds ratios with 95\%
   confidence intervals (CI). Probable depression (odds ratio = 2.42; 95\%
   CI 1.24, 4.69) and anxiety (2.30; 1.67, 3.17) at baseline predicted
   new-onset pain interference at 3-year follow-up. Conversely, pain
   interference at baseline was a risk factor for developing possible or
   probable depression (2.47; 1.96, 3.11) and anxiety (2.02; 1.60, 2.55) at
   3-year follow-up. Adjusting for age, gender and co-morbid anxiety or
   depression slightly reduced the strength of the relationships, though
   most remained statistically significant. In conclusion, we have found
   evidence for both pain-depression and pain-anxiety relationships
   longitudinally, and in a reciprocal manner. Such findings have important
   implications for the future management of primary care patients
   presenting with symptoms of pain, anxiety or depression. (C) 2010

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively study the appearance of the malleus as
   viewed through the external ear canal clinically to determine whether
   its shortened appearance in some ears is associated with otitis media.
   STUDY DESIGN: Postmortem material analysis.
   SETTING: University temporal bone laboratory.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 41 adult crania without clinical
   otitis. The mastoid size indicator of previous childhood otitis media
   was quantified radiographically. On digitized photographs of the
   tympanic membranes (64 ears useable), two sets of measurements were
   performed: 1) the distance from the malleus' lateral process to the umbo
   and to the annulus; and 2) angles formed anteriorly and posteriorly at
   the umbo.
   RESULTS: The two metrics of malleus foreshortening did not correlate
   with one another, that is, the ratio manubrium-length/tympanic diameter
   did not correlate with the ratio posterior/anterior umbo angles (for
   right ears, r = -0.34; for left, r = 0.30). Mastoid size did not
   correlate with either metric of malleus foreshortening. As to right-left
   symmetry, the size of mastoid pneumatization had good correlation (r =
   0.68, 95\% confidence interval 0.47-0.82); but, r = 0.21 for lengths, r
   = 0.34 for angles, each confidence interval included zero.
   CONCLUSION: Because the data showed no correlation of the physical
   appearance of the malleus with the mastoid size indicator of otitis
   media, and right-left symmetry was only hinted, we contend that a
   foreshortened malleus lacks clinical relevance. Foreshortened malleus is
   an anatomic variant, not a sign of pathology. (C) 2010 American Academy

Abstract = {{The present paper is focused on the mathematical modeling of the charged
   particle transport in nonuniform media. We study the energy deposition
   of high energy protons and electrons in an energy range of approximate
   to 50-500 MeV. This work is an extension of the bipartition model; for
   high energy electrons studied by Luo and Brahme in {[}Z. Luo, A. Brahme,
   High energy electron transport, Phys. Rev. B 46 (1992) 739-752] {[}42];
   and for light ions studied by Luo and Wang in {[}Z. Luo, S. Wang,
   Bipartition model of ion transport: an outline of new range theory for
   light ions, Phys. Rev. B 36 (1987) 1885-1893]; to the field of high
   energy ions in inhomogeneous media with the retained energy-loss
   straggling term. In the bipartition model, the transport equation is
   split into a coupled system of convection diffusion equations controlled
   by a partition condition. A similar split is obtained in an asymptotic
   expansion approach applied to the linear transport equation yielding
   pencil beam and broad beam models, which are again convection diffusion
   type equations. We shall focus on the bipartition model applied for
   solving three types of problems: (i) normally incident ion transport in
   a slab; (ii) obliquely incident ion transport in a semi-infinite medium;
   (iii) energy deposition of ions in a multilayer medium. The broad beam
   model of the proton absorbed dose was illustrated with the results of a
   modified Monte Carlo code: SHIELD - HIT+. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Candida bombicola, a known producer of sophorolipids (SLs; glycolipid
   surfactants), was grown on glycerol and oleic acid with up to 1.5\%
   (v/v) methanol in the fermentation growth media to assess the effects of

   Increasing methanol concentrations had little effect on the growth of
   the organism resulting in average cell dry weights (CDW; after SL
   separation) of 20.8 +/- A 0.7 g/l between 0 and 1.5\% methanol. However,
   increasing methanol concentrations decreased SL production by 56\% (from
   12.7 to 5.6 g/l at 1.5\% methanol) which translated to SL yields on a
   cellular basis of between 0.60 g SL/g cells (in the absence of methanol)
   to 0.27 g SL/g cells (in the presence of 1.5\% methanol). LC/MS revealed
   that increased methanol concentrations also resulted in larger
   concentrations (up to 20 mol\%) of free acid SLs but had little effect
   on the ratios of diacetylated SL lactones synthesized with palmitic acid
   (4 mol\%), linoleic acid (3 mol\%), oleic acid (80 mol\%), and stearic

Abstract = {{The homogeneous isotropic Boltzmann equation (HIBE) is a fundamental
   dynamic model for many applications in thermodynamics, econophysics and
   sociodynamics. Despite recent hardware improvements, the solution of the
   Boltzmann equation remains extremely challenging from the computational
   point of view. in particular by deterministic methods (free of
   stochastic noise). This work aims to improve a deterministic direct
   method recently proposed {[}V.V. Aristov, Kluwer Academic Publishers,
   2001] for solving the HIBE with a generic collisional kernel and, in
   particular, for taking care of the late dynamics of the relaxation
   towards the equilibrium. Essentially (a) the original problem is
   reformulated in terms of particle kinetic energy (exact particle number
   and energy conservation during microscopic collisions) and (b) the
   computation of the relaxation rates is improved by the DVM-like
   correction, where DVM stands for Discrete Velocity Model (ensuring that
   the macroscopic conservation laws are exactly satisfied). Both these
   corrections make possible to derive very accurate reference solutions
   for this test case. Moreover this work aims to distribute an open-source
   program (called HOMISBOLTZ), which can be redistributed and/or modified
   for dealing with different applications, under the terms of the GNU
   General Public License. The program has been purposely designed in order
   to be minimal, not only with regards to the reduced number of lines
   (less than 1000), but also with regards to the coding style (as simple
   as possible).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The records of 250 patients presenting with flail-chest
   injury in a level I trauma centre were reviewed and analysed in order to
   determine prognostic factors Methods: There were 250 consecutive trauma
   patients with flail chest, 183 men (73.2\%) and 67 women (26.8\%)
   ranging in age from 18 to 91 years, admitted to our hospital. The
   leading cause of injury was road traffic accident. One hundred and six
   patients (42.4\%) were conservatively treated, while 117 (46.8\%) needed
   thoracic drainage. Ventilatory assistance was used in 28 cases (11.2\%).
   Only 19 (7.6\%) required thoracotomy and/or laparotomy. The mortality
   rate reached 8.8\% Patients were divided into three groups: group I
   consisted of 105 patients (70/35) with an isolated flail chest (Injury
   Severity Score (ISS): 16); group II included 58 cases (48/10) with
   extrathoracic fractures (ISS: 25-30); and group III comprised 87
   patients (65/22) with injuries to the brain or to thoracic or abdominal
   organs requiring thoracotomy and/or laparotomy (ISS: >40). Parameters
   such as age, sex, ISS, presence of extrathoracic fractures,
   haemopneumothorax and head injury as well as the need for mechanical
   support in an intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality were evaluated.
   Results: The mortality rate in group Ill was higher compared to those of
   groups I and II (16\% vs 3 8\% and 6.9\%, respectively) and the
   difference was found to be statistically significant. Laparotomy and
   thoracotomy affected mortality, while age, pneumothorax and head injury
   did not. Finally, mechanical support was used only in a few cases.
   Conclusions: (1) ISS is the strongest predictor of outcome associated
   with increased mortality; and (2) mechanical support was not considered
   a necessity for the treatment of flail chest. (C) 2010 European

Title = {{Packet-Mode Emulation of Output-Queued Switches}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS}},
Year = {{2010}},

Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1378-1391}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Most common network protocols transmit variable size packets, whereas
   contemporary switches still operate with fixed-size cells, which are
   easier to transmit and buffer. This necessitates packet segmentation and
   reassembly modules, resulting in significant computation and
   communication overhead that might be too costly as switches become
   faster and bigger. It is, therefore, imperative to investigate an
   alternative mode of scheduling in which packets are scheduled
   contiguously over the switch fabric. This paper investigates the cost of
   packet-mode scheduling for the combined input-output-queued (CIOQ)
   switch architecture. We devise frame-based schedulers that allow a
   packet-mode CIOQ switch with small speedup to mimic an ideal
   output-queued switch, with bounded relative queuing delay. The
   schedulers are pipelined and based on matrix decomposition. Our
   schedulers demonstrate a trade-off between the switch speedup and the
   relative queuing delay incurred while mimicking an output-queued switch.
   When the switch is allowed to incur high relative queuing delay, a
   speedup arbitrarily close to two suffices to mimic an ideal
   output-queued switch. This implies that packet-mode scheduling does not
   require higher speedup than a cell-based scheduler. The relative queuing
   delay can be significantly reduced with just a doubling of the speedup.
   We further show that it is impossible to achieve zero relative queuing
   delay (that is, a perfect emulation), regardless of the switch speedup.
   In addition, simpler algorithms can mimic an output-queued switch with a
   bounded buffer size, using speedup arbitrarily close to one. Simulations
   confirm that packet-mode emulation with reasonable relative queuing
   delay can be achieved with moderate speedup. Furthermore, a simple and
   practical heuristic is shown by simulations to also provide effective
   packet-mode emulation.}},

Title = {{Modified Expression of Several Sperm Proteins after Chronic Exposure to

Abstract = {{Little is known about the molecular impact of in vivo exposure to
   endocrine disruptors (EDs) on sperm structures and functions. We
   recently reported that the lifelong exposure of rats to the
   antiandrogenic compound vinclozolin results in low epididymal weight,
   changes in sperm kinematic parameters, and immature sperm chromatin
   condensation, together with the impairment of several fertility end
   points. These results led us to focus specifically on possible molecular
   abnormalities in sperm. Sperm samples were recovered from the frozen
   epididymides of rats exposed during the previous study. The proteins
   present in the samples from six exposed and six control rats were
   analyzed in pairs, by two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel
   electrophoresis, to investigate possible exposure-induced changes to
   sperm protein profiles. Twelve proteins, from the 380 matched spots
   observed in at least five gels, were present in larger or smaller
   amounts after vinclozolin exposure. These proteins were identified by
   mass spectrometry, and several are known to play a crucial role in the
   sperm fertilizing ability, among which, two mitochondrial enzymes,
   malate dehydrogenase 2 and aldehyde dehydrogenase (both of which were
   present in smaller amounts after treatment) and A-kinase anchor protein
   4 (larger amounts of precursor after treatment). Finally, Ingenuity
   Pathway Analysis revealed highly significant interactions between
   proteins over-and underexpressed after treatment. This is the first
   study to show an association between in vivo exposure to an ED and
   changes to the sperm protein profile. These modifications may be at
   least partly responsible for the reproductive abnormalities and impaired
   fertility recently reported in this rat model of vinclozolin exposure.

Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Concept selection is one of the most important decisions in product
   development, since success of the final product depends on the selected
   concept. The exploration and evaluation of alternatives early in the
   product development (PD) process reduces the amount and magnitude of
   changes in later stages and increases the likelihood of success of new
   product development (NPD) projects. Though, currently available methods
   attempt to select the best concept from the available set of initial
   concepts, they do not help create an improved concept based on the
   learning and knowledge generated through the evaluation of initial
   concepts. The paper proposes a framework for selecting and/or evolving
   improved concepts through a rigorous concept evaluation and convergence
   process. The concept convergence process allows bringing together the
   best (desirable) traits from the initial set of concepts and creates a
   new set of hybrid concepts. The framework uses a fuzzy inference process
   for evaluating each initial concept against identified decision
   criteria, thus generating hybrid concepts to select the best feasible
   concept under given cost and technological constraints. The approach is
   demonstrated using a steering wheel concept generation example.

Abstract = {{A Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) technique was
   applied for the detection of Potato leaf roll polerovirus (PLRV) in
   dormant potato tubers. A primer pair was designed from the coat
   protein-encoding fragment of the PLRV genome that amplified a 336-bp
   product. The amplified product was detected in nucleic acid preparations
   from leaves and tubers of 5 cultivars and from purified virions. The
   specificity of the RT-PCR product was confirmed through southern blot
   analysis. The primer pair used in the RT-PCR did not produce any
   nonspecific product from 7 other potato viruses. Sensitivity of RT-PCR
   was confirmed by detecting PLRV from known mixture of PLRV and randomly
   selected potato virus. Dilution of 1:1000-1:4000 and 1:200-1:1000 were
   used to detect viral load from foliage and tuber, respectively:RT-PCR

Abstract = {{Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) caused by Mycoplasma
   capricolum subspecies capripneumoniae (Mccp) is a disease of goats which
   causes high morbidity and mortality and is reported in many countries of
   the world. There are probably no reports on the molecular prevalence of
   Mccp, Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum (Mcc) and Mycoplasma
   putrefaciens (Mp) in Balochistan and any other part of Pakistan. Thirty
   goats (n = 30) with marked respiratory symptoms were selected and
   procured from forty goat flocks in Pishin district of Balochistan in
   2008. The genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from the lung samples (n =
   30) of the slaughtered goats was purified and subjected to polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) assays for the presence of Mycoplasma mycoides
   cluster members and Mp. The PCR-RFLP (restriction fragment length
   polymorphism) was also used to further confirm the Mccp. Of the thirty
   lung samples 17 (56.67\%) were positive for the molecular prevalence of
   Mcc, Mccp and Mp. In total the molecular prevalence was observed as
   17.65\% for Mccp (n = 3), 70.59\% for Mcc (n = 12) and 11.76\% for Mp (n
   = 2). The RFLP profile has also validated the PCR results of Mccp by
   yielding two bands of 190 and 126 bp. The results of PCR-RFLP coupled
   with the presence of fibrinous pleuropneumonia and pleurisy during
   postmortem of goats (n = 3) strongly indicated the prevalence of CCPP in
   this part of world. Moreover the prevalence of Mcc and Mp is also
   alarming in the study area. We report for the very first time the
   molecular prevalence of Mcc, Mccp, and Mp in the lung tissues of goats
   in the Pishin district of Balochistan, Pakistan.}},

Abstract = {{Heat stress (HS) causes poor growth, immunosupression and high
   mortality, through physiological dysfunction. We have reported that
   `acute' HS increases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
   oxidative damage in the skeletal muscle of broiler chickens (Cobb), but
   that this is not for the case for males of the laying-type white leghorn
   (WLH) strain of chickens (Mujahid etal., 2005b). We have now studied the
   effects of `chronic' HS on performance and oxidative damage to skeletal
   muscle in different strains of chickens. Meat-type male chickens (Ross
   and Cobb) and male laying-type chickens (WLH) of 14 d of age were
   arranged according to a factorial design (3 strains X 4 conditions):
   control (24 C), cyclic (32-24 -32 degrees C: 32 degrees C for 8 h/d,
   32-24-32 HS), constant (32 and 34 degrees C, 32 HS and 34 HS,
   respectively) for 14 d. Feed consumption and body weight gain were
   measured. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content in
   skeletal muscle was measured colorimetrically with BHT (butylated
   hydroxytoluene) and expressed as malondialdehyde (MDA) equivalent. Body
   weight gain and feed consumption for the 3 strains (Ross, Cobb and WLH)
   were decreased by 32 HS and 34 HS, but not by 32-24 -32 HS. The decrease
   in weight gain of WLH chickens for the 32 HS and 34 HS conditions was
   smaller than for broiler chickens (Ross and Cobb). The 32 HS and 34 HS
   groups showed slightly enhanced MDA levels (P<0.05) in the skeletal
   muscle of all 3 strains, but not for the 32-24-32 HS group. The results
   suggest that depression in growth performance due to chronic heat stress
   is more evident in meat-type chickens (Ross and Cobb) than male
   laying-type chickens (WLH), and that reduction in the performance are
   associated with enhancement of oxidative damage to skeletal muscle.}},

Abstract = {{Lilium x formolongi was genetically engineered by Agrobacterium-mediated
   transformation with the plasmid pCrtZW-N8idi-crtEBIY, which contains
   seven enzyme genes under the regulation of the CaMV 35S promoter. In the
   transformants, ketocarotenoids were detected in both calli and leaves,
   which showed a strong orange color. In transgenic calli, the total
   amount of carotenoids {[}133.3 mu g/g fresh weight (FW)] was 26.1-fold
   higher than in wild-type calli. The chlorophyll content and
   photosynthetic efficiency in transgenic orange plantlets were
   significantly lowered; however, after several months of subculture, they
   had turned into plantlets with green leaves that showed significant
   increases in chlorophyll and photosynthetic efficiency. The total
   carotenoid contents in leaves of transgenic orange and green plantlets
   were quantified at 102.9 and 135.2 mu g/g FW, respectively,
   corresponding to 5.6- and 7.4-fold increases over the levels in the
   wild-type. Ketocarotenoids such as echinenone, canthaxanthin,
   3'-hydroxyechinenone, 3-hydroxyechinenone, and astaxanthin were detected
   in both transgenic calli and orange leaves. A significant change in the
   type and composition of ketocarotenoids was observed during the
   transition from orange transgenic plantlets to green plantlets. Although
   3'-hydroxyechinenone, 3-hydroxyechinenone, astaxanthin, and adonirubin
   were absent, and echinenone and canthaxanthin were present at lower
   levels, interestingly, the upregulation of carotenoid biosynthesis led
   to an increase in the total carotenoid concentration (+31.4\%) in leaves
   of the transgenic green plantlets.}},

Abstract = {{Straight-ahead resistance tests and static-yaw runs up to 20 degrees yaw
   angle for the axi-symmetric bare hull configurations of the
   ``Phoenix{''} underwater vehicle that were performed in the 90 m towing
   tank at the Institute for Ocean Technology, National Research Council,
   Canada, provided empirical formulae for the drag force, lift force and
   turning moment that are exerted on such axi-symmetric torpedo-shaped
   hull forms. The empirical formulae were then embedded in a numerical
   code to simulate the constant-depth planar manoeuvres of the MUN
   Explorer autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The simulation model was
   first calibrated using the sea-trial data, and then was used to study
   the turning manoeuvres and to compare the simulation results with those
   from theoretical formulae based on the linearized equations of motion.
   The simulation results show non-linear changes in the hydrodynamic
   coefficients as the turning manoeuvre becomes tighter. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a method for evaluating relative
   efficiencies of decision-making units (DMUs) which perform similar
   functions in a production system, consuming multiple inputs to produce
   multiple outputs. The conventional form of DEA evaluates performances of
   DMUs only from the optimistic point of view. In other words, it chooses
   the most favorable weights for each DMU. There is another approach that
   measures efficiency of a DMU from the pessimistic point of view. This
   approach chooses the most unfavorable weights for evaluation of each
   DMU. In this paper, we propose to integrate both efficiencies in the
   form of an interval in order to measure the overall performance of a
   DMU. The proposed DEA models for evaluation of efficiencies are called
   bounded DEA models. The proposed approach will be compared using a
   numerical example. Another example regarding performance evaluation of
   50 bank branches in Iranian cities will be presented to demonstrate the
   advantages, simplicity, and utility of this approach in real-life
   situations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work delta-vanadyl phosphate (VOPO(4)) was synthesized in
   the presence of different solvents like water, ethanol, diethyl ketone

   significantly the size of the crystallites and the level of impurities
   in the synthesized material. delta-VOPO(4) synthesized using water as
   solvent, possessed a significant Li-intercalation capacity ca., 124
   mAh.g(-1) at 3.7 V corresponding to 75\% of its theoretical capacity.
   Among the organic solvents used, sample prepared using ethanol exhibited
   the highest Li intercalation capacity. Small amount of beta-phase was
   observed in the synthesized delta-VOPO(4) (with phosphate/vanadium ratio
   of 2) using ethanol and Li-intercalation capacity of this phase was
   about 137 mAh.g(-1), corresponding to 85\% of the theoretical capacity.

Title = {{Filarial Parasites Develop Faster and Reproduce Earlier in Response to
   Host Immune Effectors That Determine Filarial Life Expectancy}},
Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Humans and other mammals mount vigorous immune assaults against helminth
   parasites, yet there are intriguing reports that the immune response can
   enhance rather than impair parasite development. It has been
   hypothesized that helminths, like many free-living organisms, should
   optimize their development and reproduction in response to cues
   predicting future life expectancy. However, immune-dependant development
   by helminth parasites has so far eluded such evolutionary explanation.
   By manipulating various arms of the immune response of experimental
   hosts, we show that filarial nematodes, the parasites responsible for
   debilitating diseases in humans like river blindness and elephantiasis,
   accelerate their development in response to the IL-5 driven eosinophilia
   they encounter when infecting a host. Consequently they produce
   microfilariae, their transmission stages, earlier and in greater
   numbers. Eosinophilia is a primary host determinant of filarial life
   expectancy, operating both at larval and at late adult stages in
   anatomically and temporally separate locations, and is implicated in
   vaccine-mediated protection. Filarial nematodes are therefore able to
   adjust their reproductive schedules in response to an environmental
   predictor of their probability of survival, as proposed by evolutionary
   theory, thereby mitigating the effects of the immune attack to which
   helminths are most susceptible. Enhancing protective immunity against
   filarial nematodes, for example through vaccination, may be less
   effective at reducing transmission than would be expected and may, at
   worst, lead to increased transmission and, hence, pathology.}},

Title = {{A community intervention to prevent traffic accidents among bicycle

Journal = {{REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an educational intervention designed to prevent
   traffic accidents among workers that use the bicycle for commuting.
   METHODS: A longitudinal intervention study with a stepped wedge
   implementation was carried out between January 2006 and May 2007. Five
   neighborhoods with distinct geographic characteristics were selected in
   the city of Pelotas, Brazil, and 42 census tracts were randomly selected
   from these neighborhoods. All households were screened for male bicycle
   commuters, resulting in a sample of 1,133 individuals. The outcomes
   analyzed were ``traffic accidents{''} and ``near accidents{''}. The
   cyclists were interviewed monthly by phone to record traffic accidents
   and ``near accidents{''}. Every 15 days, from the second month of study,
   a group of about 60 cyclists was invited to attend the intervention
   meeting that included an educational component (a talk and a video
   presentation), distribution of a safety kit (reflective belt \& sash,
   reflective tape and an educational booklet) and a bicycle breaks
   check-up (maintenance performed if necessary). Poisson regression
   adjusted for time effect was used to assess the intervention effect.
   RESULTS: Nearly 45\% of the cyclists did not attend the intervention.
   During the study period, 9\% of the study individuals reported a traffic
   accident and 88\% reported a ``near accident{''}. In total there were
   106 accidents and 1,091 near accidents. There was no effect observed
   from the intervention on either of the outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: The intervention tested was not capable of reducing traffic
   accidents among bicycle commuters. Lack of interest in safety by
   commuters and external factors, such as road design and motorist
   behavior, may have together influenced this result.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the associations between self-rated
   health (SRH), physical activity and other lifestyle habits among former
   athletes and referents in late adulthood. Male athletes (N = 514) who
   represented Finland from 1920 through 1965 and referents (N = 368) who
   were classified healthy at the age of 20 years participated in this
   population-based cohort study. The present analysis was based on a
   questionnaire study in 2001. SRH was assessed by a single question.
   Univariate binary and multivariate logistic regression analyses were
   used to examine the associations of health-related behaviours with SRH.
   The majority of former athletes (64 \%) rated their health better than
   referents (48 \%). A higher percentage of the athletes (54 \%) compared
   to the referents (44 \%) belonged to the most physically active groups
   (MET quintiles IV-V). A high percentage of the athletes (77 \%) and
   referents (79 \%) were occasional or moderate alcohol users. The
   proportion of never smokers among athletes was 59 \% and among referents
   37 \%. Among current smokers there were no differences in nicotine
   dependence between athletes and referents (p = 0.07). In the univariate
   analysis the odds of reporting good SRH was 2 times higher for athletes
   (OR 2.01, 95 \% CI 1.53 -2.64, p < 0.001) than for referents. In
   multivariate logistic regression analysis, former participation in team
   and power athletic groups had significantly higher SRH than the
   referents even after adjusting for age, level of physical activity,
   alcohol and smoking habit, and occupation. People who participated in
   very active physical exercise in their youth, as indexed by
   participation in competitive sports by elite athletes, continue a
   physically active lifestyle, and maintained healthier lifestyle. They
   had significantly higher SRH than the referents in their senior years,
   which was not totally explained by their physically active and healthier
   lifestyles.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ventilation on
   electrocardiographic time intervals as a function of the light-dark (LD)
   cycle in an in vivo rat model. RR, PQ, QT and QTc intervals were
   measured in female Wistar rats anaesthetized with both ketamine and
   xylazine (100 mg/15 mg/kg, i.m., open chest experiments) after
   adaptation to the LD cycle (12:12h) for 4 weeks. Electrocardiograms
   (ECG) were recorded before surgical interventions; after tracheotomy,
   and thoracotomy, and 5 minutes of stabilization with artificial
   ventilation; 30, 60, 90 and 120 seconds after the onset of apnoea; and
   after 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes of artificial reoxygenation. Time
   intervals in intact animals showed significant LD differences, except in
   the QT interval. The initial significant (p<0,001) LD differences in PQ
   interval and loss of dependence on LD cycle in the QT interval were
   preserved during short-term apnoea-induced asphyxia (30-60 sec) In
   contrast, long-term asphyxia (90-120 sec) eliminated LD dependence in
   the PQ interval, but significant LD differences were shown in the QT
   interval. Apnoea completely abolished LD differences in the RR interval.
   Reoxygenation restored the PQ and QT intervals to the pre-asphyxic LD
   differences, but with the RR intervals, the LD differences were
   eliminated. We have concluded that myocardial vulnerability is dependent
   on the LD cycle and on changes of pulmonary ventilation.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES To evaluate the use of buccal mucosa tubal graft for
   reconstruction of extensive ureteral stricture.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS Between April 2006 and July 2008, 5 patients (mean
   age, 51.2 years) underwent reconstructive ureteral surgery for ureteral
   obstruction using buccal mucosa graft. The indication of surgery was
   extensive ureteral stricture of a 4.4-cm average length (range,
   3.5-5.0). The site of stricture was in the proximal and the middle
   ureter in 3 and 2 patients, respectively. The causes of stricture were
   postinflammatory (3 cases) and iatrogenic after ureteroscopic procedures
   for impacted stones (2 cases).
   RESULTS All 5 patients underwent successful ureteral defect replacement
   using buccal mucosal tube. The intraoperative course was uneventful
   without any major complications. Mean operative time was 106 minutes
   (range, 85-130). With a mean follow-up of 24 months (range, 14-39), the
   operated kidneys showed no obstruction.
   CONCLUSIONS Oral buccal mucosal tubal graft for reconstruction of
   extensive ureteral stricture is a good available option. Although the
   results of this initial experience are encouraging, a bigger series and
   longer follow-up is recommended to evaluate our procedure. UROLOGY 76:

Abstract = {{Purpose The optimal method to assess human epidermal growth factor
   receptor 2 (HER2) status remains highly controversial. Before reporting
   patient HER2 results, American Society of Clinical Oncology
   (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines mandate that
   laboratories demonstrate >= 95\% concordance to another approved
   laboratory or methodology. Here, we compare central laboratory HER2
   assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and quantitative
   reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using Oncotype
   DX in lymph nodenegative, chemotherapy-untreated patients from a large
   Kaiser Permanente case-control study.
   Patients and Methods Breast cancer specimens from the Kaiser-Genomic
   Health study were examined. Central FISH assessment of HER2
   amplification and polysomy 17 was conducted by PhenoPath Laboratories
   (ratios > 2.2, 1.8 to 2.2, and < 1.8 define HER2 positive, HER2
   equivocal, and HER2 negative, respectively). HER2 expression by RT-PCR
   was conducted using Oncotype DX by Genomic Health (normalized expression
   units >= 11.5, 10.7 to < 11.5, and < 10.7 define HER2 positive, HER2
   equivocal, and HER2 negative, respectively). Concordance analyses
   followed ASCO/CAP guidelines.
   Results HER2 concordance by central FISH and central RT-PCR was 97\%
   (95\% CI, 96\% to 99\%). Twelve percent (67 of 568 patients) and 11\%
   (60 of 568 patients) of patients were HER2 positive by RT-PCR and FISH,
   respectively. HER2-positive patients had increased odds of dying from
   breast cancer compared with HER2-negative patients. Polysomy 17 was
   demonstrated in 12.5\% of all patients and 33\% of FISH-positive
   patients. Nineteen of 20 FISH-positive patients with polysomy 17 were
   also RT-PCR HER2 positive. Although not statistically significantly
   different, HER2positive/polysomy 17 patients tended to have the worst
   prognosis, followed by HER2-positive/eusomic, HER2-negative/polysomy 17,
   and HER2-negative/eusomic patients.
   Conclusion There is a high degree of concordance between central FISH
   and quantitative RT-PCR using Oncotype DX for HER2 status, and the assay
   warrants additional study in a trastuzumab-treated population.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate images of
   extended depth-of-field (DOF) to support realization of
   three-dimensional (3D) imaging systems such as integral imaging. In our
   approach in extending the DOF, we take advantage of the spatial
   frequency spectrum of the object specific to the task in hand. The pupil
   function is thus engineered in such a fashion that the modulation
   transfer function (MTF) is maximized only in these selected spatial
   frequencies. We extract these high energy spatial frequencies using the
   principal component analysis (PCA) method. Moreover, given the need for
   many pupil function engineering steps in 3D imaging systems, we have
   constructed an approximate expression for MTF to be used in the design
   of optimum amplitude and/or phase pupil filter. Moreover, we have
   optimized the DOF extension process with blocking the minimum possible
   area in the pupil plane. This maximizes the output image quality (e. g.
   10\% DOF improvement) compared to the existing methods where non-optimal
   blocking of the lens area may cause more degradation in output image
   quality. Experimental results are presented to illustrate our proposed
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{In the author's concept of risk averse maintenance Introduced in a
   previous paper, we seek to minimize the disutility of cost per unit time
   rather than to minimize cost per unit time itself This gives a
   maintenance policy that is optimal under risk aversion This paper
   extends the earlier work by providing a solution to the problem of
   combining risk aversion with the cost discounting that arises from the
   time value of money The effect of parameter uncertainty which was
   touched on in the earlier work, is here shown to lead to a minimax
   solution when operation for a long period with model uncertainty is
   planned The possible use of non exponential utility functions is
   discussed In an attempt to make risk-averse maintenance more meaningful
   for practitioners a fresh example of its use the maintenance of a
   standby system, is given A graphical aid to decision support is given,
   and some useful financial measures of risk value at risk and expected
   shortfall, are introduced These can be used to characterize planned
   maintenance policies}},

Abstract = {{Platelets are known to undergo shape change, activation, release
   reaction and apoptosis/necrosis during processing and storage. Apheresis
   may have a deleterious impact on platelet achievability and functional
   integrity. Platelet concentrates from 50 male volunteers obtained by
   COBE spectra were screened for platelet activation (CD62 and CD154) and
   apoptosis (phosphatidylserine detected by Annexin V). Donor samples
   before separation, during apheresis and at the third day of storage were
   used as baseline donor samples. Platelet aggregation to adenosine
   diphosphate (ADP) and collagen was performed. There was a statistically
   significant increase in the expression of activation markers in two
   different samples (during separation samples and third day samples).
   Although the increase in Annexin V expression was not so observable, it
   showed a significant increase also. There was marked decline in the
   platelet aggregation. The correlations between the values of CD62, CD154
   and Annexin V were detected in baseline samples and increased during
   separation and at the third day of platelets storage. Correlation
   between values of platelet aggregation to collagen and Annexin V was
   relevant only in the baseline samples. No other correlations were
   encountered between platelet aggregation and markers of activation and
   apoptosis during apheresis and storage. Initial platelet activation
   induced by apheresis may have an impact on phosphatidylserine expression
   with no impact on aggregation function of platelets during storage.}},

Title = {{Statistical Analyses and Parametric Study for Reinforced Concrete Beams
   Strengthened in Flexure with FRPs}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5, SI}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, statistical analyses and a parametric study are presented
   for reinforced concrete beams strengthened in flexure using FRP
   composites. Five variables are considered in this study; namely, the FRP
   axial stiffness, concrete strength, steel reinforcement ratio, beam
   depth, and beam span. We aim to develop statistics-based design
   equations to predict the debonding load, the flexural capacity of the
   beam cross-section, the maximum deflection at the debonding load, the
   ductility index, and the debonding strain level in the FRP laminate.
   Simplifying these statistical models is then carried out to develop
   robust design equations. These equations hold an advantage over those
   available in most code specifications because they account for the
   effect of interactions between various variables on the predicted
   quantities.
   The statistical analyses are primarily based on the response surface
   methodology (RSM) technique. The proposed models are thus referred to as
   the RSM models. Proposed design equations are then developed by
   simplifying the RSM models using Monte Carlo simulations and nonlinear
   regression analysis. Of the five responses considered in the RSM
   analysis, only the debonding strain level in FRP laminates is considered
   in the design equations. The data required for the statistical analysis
   were obtained from finite element models for beams having different
   combinations of variables.
   The statistical analyses are followed by a parametric study to
   investigate the effect of the above five variables and their
   interactions on the debonding load and the corresponding debonding
   strain level in the FRP laminate. This involves comparisons in terms of
   the debonding strain between the predictions of the proposed equation
   and those of the ACI, fib, Chinese specifications, and Australian
   standards.}},

Abstract = {{The focal aim of the present study was to identify the genetic
   alterations occurring in the tannery workers and surrounding inhabitants
   chronically exposed to hexavalent chromium {[}Cr(VI)].
   A total of 108 samples which includes 72 exposed subjects {[}36 directly
   exposed (DE) subjects and 36 indirectly exposed (IE) subjects] and 36
   controls were recruited for this study. The exposed subjects and
   controls were selected based on the Cr level present in air and their
   urine. Directly exposed subjects were categorized based on their work
   duration in the tannery industries, whereas the indirectly exposed
   subjects were categorized based on their year of residence in the place
   adjacent to tannery industries for more than 3 decades. Controls were
   normal and healthy. Age was matched for the exposed subjects and
   controls. The exposed subjects as well as the controls were categorized
   based on their age (group I, < 40 years; group II, > 41 years). Cell
   cultures were established from blood samples (5 ml from each subject)
   collected from the subjects (exposed subjects and controls) after
   obtaining informed consent. G-banding (Giemsa staining) of the cultures,
   micronucleus (MN) assay and comet assay were used to identify the
   genetic alterations of individuals exposed to Cr(VI) in comparison with
   the controls.
   A higher degree of total CA {[}12 +/- A 8.49 (21-25 years)] and MN
   {[}18.69 +/- A 7.39 (11-15 years)] was found in DE subjects compared to
   other groups. In IE subjects, elevated levels of CA {[}5.67 +/- A 1.15
   (51-60 years)] and MN {[}25 +/- A 9.89 (71-80 years)] were observed. As
   expected, controls exhibited minimal number of alterations. The overall
   CA frequency due to Cr exposure was significantly different from that of
   the controls for both chromatid and chromosome type aberrations (P <
   0.05 by ANOVA). The MN/1,000 binucleated cells were significantly
   increased (P < 0.05) in the peripheral lymphocytes of DE and IE subjects
   in comparison with controls. The mean tail length of comet assay for DE,
   IE and controls were analyzed. The mean tail length of DE subjects
   {[}4.21 (3.21-10.98)] was higher compared to that of IE subjects {[}3.98
   (2.98-11.27)] and controls {[}3.01 (2.68-9.40)].
   In conclusion, this work shows a clear genotoxic effect associated with
   chromium exposure, both directly and indirectly. Our result reinforces
   the higher sensitivity of cytogenetic assays for the biomonitoring of
   occupationally exposed populations. There is a strong need to educate
   those who work with potentially hazardous heavy about its adverse
   effects and highlight the importance of using protective measures.}},

Abstract = {{The peak procedure is widely used in the study of interval timing with
   animals. Multiple timing measures can be derived from peak responding.
   These measures are typically presented as averages across many trials
   based on the implicit assumption that peak responding is stable
   throughout the session. We tested this assumption by examining whether
   peak responding changed over the course of the session in 45 mice that
   were trained on a fixed-interval 30-s schedule. All common measures of
   peak responding, except stop times, changed over the course of the
   session: start times increased, response rates and spreads decreased,
   and, although less reliably, peak times also shifted rightward. These
   results are congruent with a motivational interpretation, whereby
   increased satiety leads to the observed behavioral signature of
   within-session modulation of timed anticipatory responding. (c) 2010

Abstract = {{The effects of full lung inflation on respiratory conductance (Grs) and
   reactance (Xrs) were measured in 15 subjects with moderate to severe
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 11 matched healthy
   control subjects. Airway distensibility was estimated from the ratio of
   the difference of Grs between functional residual capacity and total
   lung capacity to the relevant changes in lung volume (Delta Grs/Delta
   VL) or transpulmonary pressure (Delta Grs/Delta Ptp). Similar analysis
   was applied to Xrs to estimate lung volume recruitment (Delta Xrs/Delta
   VL or Delta Xrs/Delta Ptp). The extent of emphysema in COPD subjects was
   estimated from the percentage of low attenuation area (LAA) at
   high-resolution computed tomography. At baseline, Delta Grs/Delta VL and
   Delta Xrs/Delta VL were significantly less in COPD than control
   subjects, indicating less distensibility and volume recruitment in the
   former. In COPD, Delta Grs/Delta Ptp and Delta Xrs/Delta Ptp were
   uncorrelated with LAA but correlated with 1-s forced expiratory volume
   and with each other. After albuterol, both Delta Grs/Delta Ptp and Delta
   Grs/Delta VL became significantly and negatively correlated with LAA,
   while Delta Xrs/Delta Ptp and Delta Xrs/Delta VL decreased significantly
   independently of LAA. Moreover, Delta Grs/Delta Ptp and Delta Xrs/Delta
   Ptp with lung inflation were no longer correlated with each other,
   suggesting that airway distensibility and volume recruitment were
   affected differently by airway smooth muscle tone. Assuming that Grs
   mainly reflects airway caliber and Xrs the number of ventilated lung
   units, we conclude that airway smooth muscle contributes to airway
   stiffness and ventilation inhomogeneities in COPD subjects with
   prevailing bronchitis but only to the latter in those with more
   emphysema. We suggest that changes of airway distensibility and volume
   recruitment with a bronchodilator may be useful for disease phenotyping.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a study that was carried out to investigate the
   effect of pair work on a word-building task in two EFL classes. Forty
   Iranian adult students participated in this study. The participants in
   the experimental group completed the word-building task in pairs
   following the Think-Pair-Share technique, whereas the participants in
   the control group did the same task individually. Results of the data
   analysis showed that the participants in the experimental group achieved
   significantly higher scores on the given task than the participants in

   forces and contact times during plyometric drop jumping. J Strength Cond
   Res 24(10): 2762-2769, 2010-Drop jumping (DJ) is used in training
   programs aimed to improve lower extremity explosive power. When
   performing double-leg drop jumps, it is important to provide an equal
   stimulus to both legs to ensure balanced development of the lower legs.
   The aim of this study was to bilaterally analyze the ground reactions
   forces and temporal components of drop jumping from 3 heights. Ten
   recreationally active male subjects completed 3 bounce-drop jumps from 3
   starting heights (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m). Two linked force platforms were
   used to record left-and right-leg peak vertical force, time to peak
   force, average force, ground contact time, impulse and time
   differential. Between-height and between-leg comparisons for each
   variable were made using a multivariate analysis of variance with post
   hoc Wilcoxon tests (p < 0.05). Results indicated that force and time
   variables increased as drop jump height increased (p < 0.0001). Post hoc
   analyses showed that at 0.2- and 0.4-m bilateral differences were
   present in the time to peak force, average force, and impulse. No
   bilateral differences for any variables were shown at 0.6-m starting
   height. The contact time for all jumps was <0.26 seconds. At 0.2 m, only
   63\% of the subjects had a starting time differential of <0.01 seconds,
   rising to 96.3\% at 0.6 m. The results indicated that 0.6 m is the
   suggested drop jump height to ensure that no bilateral differences in
   vertical forces and temporal components occur; however, shorter contact
   times were found at the lower heights.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. The main objective of this 1.5-year prospective study was to
   evaluate the value of T-SPOT<SU (R)</SU.TB as compared to the tuberculin
   skin test (TST) for the first-line assessment of uveitis.
   Methods. A total of 108 consecutive non-immunocompromised patients with
   acute or chronic uveitis, including 92/108 (85.2\%) with previous BCG
   vaccination, underwent a general examination, a TST, and a T-SPOT.TB
   test (Oxford Immunotec; Oxford, UK), blood and serological tests, and
   chest imaging. Concordance between tests was assessed using kappa
   coefficients. The performance of binary classification tests was
   evaluated with sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios.
   Results. The results of the TST and the T-SPOT.TB test differed
   significantly (55.5\% versus 29.6\% positivity, P < 0.001), with a low
   concordance between the two tests (kappa = 0.362, P = 0.001). The
   sensitivity of the TST was 100\% (diagnosis of suspected tuberculous
   uveitis included a positive TST), but its specificity was only 53.3\%.
   The sensitivity and the specificity of the T-SPOT.TB test were 94.4\%
   and 83.3\%, respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios of
   the T-SPOT.TB test were 5.67 and 0.07, respectively.
   Conclusion. In uveitis patients with frequent previous BCG vaccination,
   the T-SPOT.TB test is more specific than the TST and therefore allows
   more accurate selection of patients requiring extensive investigations
   to rule out TB diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{n-3 PUFAs have beneficial health effects which are believed to be partly
   related to their anti-inflammatory properties, however the exact
   mechanisms behind this are unknown. One possible explanation could be
   via their conversion to N-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs), which are known to
   possess anti-inflammatory properties. Using fatty acid precursors we
   showed that 3T3-L1 adipocytes are indeed able to convert docosahexaenoic
   acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to their NAE derivatives
   docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA) and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine
   (EPEA), respectively. This synthesis took place on top of an apparent
   background formation of these NAEs in standard culture medium. In
   addition we were able to demonstrate the presence of DHEA, but not of
   EPEA, in human plasma. DHEA and EPEA were found to decrease LPS induced
   adipocyte IL-6 and MCP-1 levels. Results of combined incubations with
   PPAR-gamma and CB2 antagonists suggest a role of these receptors in
   mediating the reduction of IL-6 by DHEA. Our results are in line with
   the hypothesis that in addition to other pathways, formation of N-acyl
   ethanolamines may contribute to the biological activity of n-3 PUFAs.
   Different targets, including the endocannabinoid system, may be involved
   in the immune-modulating activity of these ``fish-oil-derived NAEs.{''}

   acetate (12.5\%), trans-beta-ocimene (8.8\%), p-cymene (7.7\%) and
   gamma-terpinene (7.4\%). The samples were screened for their antioxidant
   activities using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical and
   beta-carotene/linoleic acid assay methods. None of the plant samples
   showed appreciable antioxidant activity in DPPH test. However, methanol
   extract exhibited considerable linoleic acid oxidation inhibition
   (77.4\%) in the beta-carotene/linoleic acid test, a value near to that
   of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, 95.6\%). Total phenolic content of the
   plant extract as gallic acid equivalents was 7.5 mu g/mg. The essential
   oil exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against all but one of the

Abstract = {{Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways form the backbone of
   signal transduction in the mammalian cell. Here we applied a systematic

   assemble these data into functional modules. Multiple lines of evidence
   including conservation with yeast supported a core network of 641
   interactions. Using small interfering RNA knockdowns, we observed that
   approximately one-third of MAPK-interacting proteins modulated
   MAPK-mediated signaling. We uncovered the Na-H exchanger NHE1 as a
   potential MAPK scaffold, found links between HSP90 chaperones and MAPK
   pathways and identified MUC12 as the human analog to the yeast signaling
   mucin Msb2. This study makes available a large resource of MAPK
   interactions and clone libraries, and it illustrates a methodology for
   probing signaling networks based on functional refinement of

Abstract = {{In this paper we use mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA variation to
   investigate the mechanisms that underlie the evolution of population
   structure in a highly mobile marine mammal, the white-beaked dolphin. We
   found moderate genetic diversity (h) at mtDNA, but low nucleotide
   diversity (pi) (0.7320 +/- 0.0031 and 0.0056 +/- 0.0004, respectively),
   consistent with expectations for a recent expansion. Analyses based on
   mismatch distributions further suggested a demographic expansion in the
   Norwe-gian-Barents Sea population and a spatial expansion in the British
   isles-North Sea population, implying distinct demographic histories.
   F-ST values showed clear differentiation among these two populations,
   but no difference was found between putative populations separated by
   the English Channel. Our data suggest a stepwise pattern of expansion,
   dependent on available coastal habitat. The conservation implications

Abstract = {{Represented by approximately 85 species, Hemidactylus is one of the most
   diverse and widely distributed genera of reptiles in the world. In the
   Indian subcontinent, this genus is represented by 28 species out of
   which at least 13 are endemic to this region. Here, we report the
   phylogeny of the Indian Hemidactylus geckos based on mitochondrial and
   nuclear DNA markers sequenced from multiple individuals of widely
   distributed as well as endemic congeners of India.
   Results indicate that a majority of the species distributed in India
   form a distinct clade whose members are largely confined to the Indian
   subcontinent thus representing a unique Indian radiation. The remaining
   Hemidactylus geckos of India belong to two other geographical clades
   representing the Southeast Asian and West-Asian arid zone species.
   Additionally, the three widely distributed, commensal species (H.
   brookii, H. frenatus and H. flaviviridis) are nested within the Indian
   radiation suggesting their Indian origin. Dispersal-vicariance analysis
   also supports their Indian origin and subsequent dispersal out-of-India
   into West-Asian arid zone and Southeast Asia. Thus, Indian subcontinent
   has served as an important arena for diversification amongst the
   Hemidactylus geckos and in the evolution and spread of its commensal
   geckos. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new series of dimers of de(N-methyl) erythromycin derivatives, joined
   by a -COCH2- or -CH2CH2-linker, was synthesized and their in vitro
   antiproliferative activity against three human cancer cell lines was
   evaluated. Structure-activity relationships indicated that
   transformation of the linker -COCH2- into -CH2CH2- led to an increase in
   the potency of the compound; removal of cladinose and conversion of the
   carbonyl group at the C9 position to 9(S)-hydroxyl- or
   9(S)-amino-containing groups resulted in a marked decrease in activity.
   Among the compounds synthesized, compounds 3d and 3e, both had C9 oxime
   groups and showed strong inhibitory activity against the three cell
   lines. Flow cytometry studies on HT-1080 cells indicated that the
   mechanism underlying the dimers' antiproliferative activity involved
   inducing cell cycle arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase. It was discovered
   that the percentage of HT-1080 cells arrested depended on the
   concentration of the erythromycin derivative dimer and on the length of
   time of treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The grain size controlled bulk Lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) cathode

   degrees C lower than the sintering temperature of the coarse powders.
   The thermionic emission current density was measured to be 42.0 A/cm(2),
   which is much higher than 24.2 A/cm(2) of coarse powders and Vickers
   hardness to be 1860 kg/mm(2), which is also higher than 1700 kg/mm(2) of

Abstract = {{This letter presents a novel compact dual-hand bandpass filter (BPF),
   which consists of two pairs of half-guided wavelength slot-line
   resonators. The two pairs of resonators, operating at different
   frequencies, generate two passbands for the proposed BPF by utilizing a
   novel coupling scheme. Tight coupling between the two resonators in each
   of the pairs can be simultaneously achieved, and the interaction between
   the two pairs is negligible. Thus the operation frequencies of the two
   passbands can be controlled independently. Several attenuation poles are
   created to enhance the selectivity of the proposed filter. The simulated
   and measured results are presented, showing good agreement. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{In this paper we classify Weingarten surfaces integrable in the sense of
   soliton theory. The criterion is that the associated Gauss equation
   possesses an sl(2)-valued zero curvature representation with a
   nonremovable parameter. Under certain restrictions on the jet order, the
   answer is given by a third order ordinary differential equation to
   govern the functional dependence of the principal curvatures. Employing
   the scaling and translation (offsetting) symmetry, we give a general
   solution of the governing equation in terms of elliptic integrals. We
   show that the instances when the elliptic integrals degenerate to
   elementary functions were known to nineteenth-century geometers.
   Finally, we characterize the associated normal congruences.}},

Abstract = {{Technological advances in positioning methods have enabled the
   development of methodologies that allow its use in a great variety of
   applications. One method of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System)
   positioning of high performance is the RTK (Real Time Kinematic) whose
   basic principle takes advantage of the high correlation of the errors
   caused by ionosphere, troposphere and satellite orbit in a reference
   station and a nearby station of interest, besides requiring a radio link
   or other communication system to transmit the data from the base to the
   user. But as the distances increase, the correlation decreases and the
   performance is reduced. To reduce this problem, the concept of network
   stations (RTK Network) was developed. Such approach uses the
   infrastructure of a network of reference stations to provide corrections
   to the network users. The RTK and RTK network allows introducing the
   concept of integrity, widely used in navigation, in the context of
   Geodesy. In this article, we present the concept of integrity and its
   use for evaluating the integrity on RTK and RTK network in the context
   of Sao Paulo State GNSS network. Results showed that to guarantee the
   integrity displayed by HPL <AL, VPL <AL and AC <AL, represented by
   horizontal protection level (HPL) and vertical protection level (VPL) in
   relation to the alarm limit (AL) and accuracy (AC) were on average
   68.3\% and 63.9\% for the horizontal and vertical, component
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The Your Rights at Work Campaign in the lead-up to the 2007 Australian
   federal election successfully mobilised a groundswell of community
   opposition to the radically anti-union Work Choices employment relations
   legislation of 2005. There were hopes that its successor, the 2009 Fair
   Work Act, would usher in a new regime of good-faith workplace relations,
   support for collective bargaining and vulnerable workers' access to
   enforceable labour rights. Major gaps are the failure to address
   workplace power imbalance, especially in small workplaces, and lack of
   support for employee participation and voice mechanisms. A case is made
   for the inclusion of such mechanisms in legislative National Employment
   Standards. The article concludes by arguing that it is a mistake for
   unions to expect too much from legislation, rather than investing in the
   pursuit of the sort of community alliances which, after all, have made a
   restoration of Work Choices untenable.}},

Title = {{Development and Validation of a Comprehensive Semi-Quantitative Food
   Frequency Questionnaire that Includes FODMAP Intake and Glycemic Index}},

Abstract = {{Background Fermentable, short chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs) have been
   identified as triggers for functional gastrointestinal symptoms. In
   addition, excess FODMAP consumption has been implicated in the onset of
   Crohn's disease, and animal studies suggest that a low glycemic index
   diet can impair absorption of fructose, a major dietary FODMAP. Such
   hypotheses cannot be tested without the ability to quantify FODMAP
   ingestion with a validated dietary assessment tool.
   Objective To assess the validity and reproducibility of a 297-item
   comprehensive, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in
   estimating intake of macro- and micronutrients, FODMAPs, and glycemic
   index/load.
   Subjects/setting One hundred healthy participants were recruited to
   complete the FFQ on two occasions, plus four 1-week food diaries kept
   during a 12-month period. Participants exhibiting major dietary change
   during the study period or low energy reporting on the FFQ were
   excluded.
   Main outcome measures Validation and reproducibility of the
   semi-quantitative FFQ by comparison with the mean of four 1-week food
   diaries.
   Statistical analyses performed Validation was assessed using Wilcoxon
   signed rank test, Spearman's correlation, Bland-Altman, and weighted K
   statistics. Reproducibility was examined using Shrout-Fleiss intraclass
   correlation coefficient.
   Results Seventy-two participants fulfilled inclusion and exclusion
   criteria. Demographics of the participants were comparable with 2006
   Australian Census data. Consistent with other reported FFQs, the FFQ
   overestimated nutrient intake by a mean 140\% (range=95\% to 249\%).
   However, based on the other analyses performed, it demonstrated validity
   for intake of sugars, fiber, alcohol, glycemic index, glucose, FODMAPs,
   calcium, folate, phosphate, potassium, iron, and magnesium; moderate
   validation for energy, total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, sodium,
   thiamin, sucrose, and retinol; poor validation for protein,
   mono/polyunsaturated fat, starch, glycemic load, niacin, and zinc.
   Riboflavin intake was not validated. Intraclass correlation coefficients
   for reproducibility ranged from 0.352 to 0.928.
   Conclusions The FFQ was validated for assessment of a wide range of
   nutrients, including the new class of carbohydrates, FODMAPs, and
   glycemic index. This provides a useful tool for dietary research,
   particularly in the area of gastroenterological disorders. J Am Diet

Abstract = {{The upper Great Egg Harbor River watershed in New Jersey's Coastal Plain
   is urbanized but extensive freshwater wetlands are present downstream.
   In 2006-2007, studies to assess levels of total mercury (THg) found
   concentrations in unfiltered streamwater to range as high as 187 ng/L in
   urbanized areas. THg concentrations were < 20 ng/L in streamwater in
   forested/wetlands areas where both THg and dissolved organic carbon
   concentrations tended to increase while pH and concentrations of
   dissolved oxygen and nitrate decreased with flushing of soils after
   rain. Most of the river's flow comes from groundwater seepage;
   unfiltered groundwater samples contained up to 177 ng/L of THg in urban
   areas where there is a history of well water with THg that exceeds the
   drinking water standard (2,000 ng/L). THg concentrations were lower (<
   25 ng/L) in unfiltered groundwater from downstream wetland areas. In
   addition to higher THg concentrations (mostly particulate),
   concentrations of chloride were higher in streamwater and groundwater
   from urban areas than in those from downstream wetland areas.
   Methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in unfiltered streamwater ranged
   from 0.17 ng/L at a forest/wetlands site to 2.94 ng/L at an urban site.
   The percentage of THg present as MeHg increased as the percentage of
   forest + wetlands increased, but also was high in some urban areas. MeHg
   was detected only in groundwater < 1 m below the water/sediment
   interface. Atmospheric deposition is presumed to be the main source of
   Hg to the wetlands and also may be a source to groundwater, where
   wastewater inputs in urban areas are hypothesized to mobilize Hg
   deposited to soils.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to provide a first approach to the evolution of
   Iberia's vegetation during the Cenozoic (with the exclusion of the
   Quaternary). The Palaeogene was floristically defined by Palaeotropical
   elements forming tropical/subtropical rainforests, mangrove swamps,
   edaphically-mediated laurophyllous forests and leguminous-sclerophyllous
   communities. During the Miocene. Iberian landscapes were drastically
   modified due to geographic and climatic changes (mainly cooling and
   aridification) changes. Open, steppe-like environments developed towards
   the interior of the peninsula and Arctotertiary elements invaded
   mountainous and riparian ecosystems, coexisting with or becoming part of
   evergreen, broadleaved forests of Palaeotropical species. From the Late
   Miocene onwards these forests suffered changes due to the extinction of
   taxa, the impact of environmental change on the survivors, and the
   perturbations caused by the arrival of further Arctotertiary elements.
   However, several Palaeotropical taxa overcame the environmental and
   climatic changes of the Miocene and Pliocene to form a part of the
   modern flora of the Iberian Peninsula. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Self-diffusion of zinc and effect of UV irradiation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{108}},

Abstract = {{Zn-ZnO superhydrophobic thin films have been prepared by thermal
   oxidation of sputtered Zn. The superhydrophobicity observed in these
   coatings is attributed to multiscale roughness in the nanometric range
   only. The higher scale roughness was due to the combination of
   nanoclusters (solid regions) and air gaps while the lower scale
   roughness was due to the textured surface created by the fusion of
   individual ZnO nanocrystals to form the nanoclusters. The
   superhydrophobicity in these coatings has been observed only for an
   optimum combination of solid regions (i.e., nanoclusters) and air
   pockets. Experimental evidences have been provided to demonstrate that
   an additional micron-scale roughness on the substrate does not affect
   the wettability of the coating. It has been observed that the
   wettability of the Zn-ZnO coatings changes from hydrophobic to
   superhydrophobic during the initial 24 h after deposition. This occurs
   due to the outward self-diffusion of Zn to the surface and its
   subsequent oxidation under ambient conditions. Field-emission scanning
   electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used
   to demonstrate the morphological changes while micro-Raman spectroscopy
   was used to record the chemical changes on the coating surface as a
   result of the outward diffusion and subsequent oxidation of Zn. Studies
   have also been carried out to determine the effect of UV irradiation on
   the Zn-ZnO coatings. The UV irradiation transformed the Zn-ZnO surface
   from superhydrophobic to hydrophilic. Our studies based on FESEM, AFM,
   micro-Raman spectroscopy, and roughness profilometry show that this
   transformation was mainly due to the morphological changes that occur in
   addition to the chemical changes taking place on the ZnO surface under
   the influence of UV irradiation. The UV irradiation disturbs the optimum
   density of air pockets, leading to the loss of superhydrophobicity. (C)

   Insect biodiversity is often positively associated with habitat

   heterogeneity in ground-dwelling beetle assemblages under co-occurring
   trees in the same subgenus: Eucalyptus melliodora A. Cunn. ex Schauer
   and E. blakelyi Maiden (Myrtaceae).
   Location
   Critically endangered grassy woodland near Canberra, south-eastern
   Australia.
   Methods
   We used pitfall traps and Tullgren funnels to sample ground-dwelling
   beetles from the litter environment under 47 trees, and examined
   differences in diversity and composition at spatial scales ranging from
   100 to 1000 m.
   Results
   Beetle assemblages under the two tree species had distinctive
   differences in diversity and composition. We found that E. melliodora
   supported a higher richness and abundance of beetles, but had higher
   compositional similarity among samples. In contrast, E. blakelyi had a
   lower abundance and species richness of beetles, but more variability in
   species composition among samples.
   Main conclusions
   Our study shows that heterogeneity in litter habitat under co-occurring
   and closely related eucalypt species can influence beetle assemblages at
   spatial scales of just hundreds of metres. The differential contribution
   to fine-scale alpha and beta diversity by each eucalypt can be exploited
   for conservation purposes by ensuring an appropriate mix of the two
   species in the temperate woodlands where they co-occur. This would help
   not only to maximize biodiversity at landscape scales, but also to
   maintain heterogeneity in species richness, trophic function and biomass
   at fine spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{We study small charged black holes in global AdS spacetime in the
   presence of a charged massless minimally coupled scalar field. In a
   certain parameter range these black holes suffer from well known
   superradiant instabilities. We demonstrate that the end point of the
   resultant tachyon condensation process is a hairy black hole which we
   construct analytically in a perturbative expansion in the black hole
   radius. At leading order our solution is a small undeformed RNAdS black
   hole immersed into a charged scalar condensate that fills the AdS `box'.
   These hairy black hole solutions appear in a two parameter family
   labelled by their mass and charge. Their mass is bounded from below by a
   function of their charge; at the lower bound a hairy black hole reduces
   to a regular horizon free soliton which can also be thought of as a
   nonlinear Bose condensate. We compute the microcanonical phase diagram
   of our system at small mass, and demonstrate that it exhibits a second
   order `phase transition' between the RNAdS black hole and the hairy
   black hole phases.}},

Abstract = {{Context.-The association of circulating donor-specific antibody (DSA)
   strength with crossmatch results is of potential interest to predict
   allograft outcome.
   Objectives.-To systematically investigate the aforementioned association
   and to attempt to define a cutoff value for DSA strength that can
   predict a positive crossmatch result.
   Design.-We analyzed DSA strength and crossmatch results from the 2006 to
   2008 proficiency testing samples of the American Society of
   Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics (n = 50). We further validated our
   findings in candidates for potential kidney transplant (n = 19).
   Results.-Proficiency test samples with positive antihuman globulin
   T-cell crossmatch results had significantly higher DSA strength, as
   assessed by Luminex (Austin, Texas) mean fluorescent intensity (MFI; MFI
   {[}SD], 7860 {[}4770]), compared with samples with negative crossmatch
   results (MFI {[}SD], 2900 {[}1820]; P = .001). Similarly, higher Luminex
   values were observed in samples from candidates for transplant with
   positive antihuman globulin T-cell crossmatch results (MFI {[}SD], 7910
   {[}2370] versus 2840 {[}1960]; P < .001). The MFI value of 6540 had 61\%
   and 75\% sensitivity and 92\% and 94\% specificity for predicting
   positive antihuman globulin T-cell crossmatches in proficiency test
   samples and in candidates for transplant, respectively.
   Conclusions.-The DSA strength correlates well with crossmatch results.
   An MFI of 6540 predicted a positive antihuman globulin T-cell
   crossmatch. (Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2010;134:1534-1540)}},

Abstract = {{Fluctuations in the electrical conductivity of polycrystalline Ho1-x Pr
   (x) Ba2Cu3O7-delta superconductors were investigated with Ho contents
   from x=0.01 up to 0.10. Samples were prepared by the standard

   determination of the quantity chi(-1)(sigma,) = -d/dt In Delta
   sigma,where Delta sigma=sigma-sigma (R) is the fluctuation conductivity.
   The results show that the resistive transition proceeds in two stages as
   seen by the temperature derivative of the resistivity near T-C . In the
   normal phase, Gaussian and critical fluctuation conductivity regimes
   were identified. The pairing transition splitting, associated with Pr
   doping and related to the occurrence of a phase separation, as observed
   in studies with other rare earth elements, was not clearly observed. On
   approaching the zero-resistance state, our results show a power-law
   behavior that corresponds to a phase transition from a paracoherent to a
   coherent state of the granular array. This behavior was not affected by
   Pr doping.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to evaluate the immature stages
   development and the reproductive parameters of Grapholita molesta adults
   reared on shoots and fruit of `Vanguarda' peach, on fruit of `Gala' and
   `Fuji' apples, and on a diet formulated with corn meal. The experimental
   design was completely randomized. Each insect was considered one
   replicate; and for the biological parameters of adults study, each
   couple was considered a replicate. The fertility life table was
   calculated. The time for larvae development was shorter in peach shoots
   and fruits, in comparison with apple fruit and corn meal diets. There
   were no differences for larvae survival, in the comparison between
   diets. Based on fertility life table, `Fuji' apple fruit are more
   appropriated to the G. molesta development than Gala ones. Peach shoots
   were more suited for insect development than fruit. The corn meal-based
   diet is suitable to rear G. molesta in laboratory. The evaluated diets
   affect survival rate, development and growth potential of G. molesta

   nonaxisymmetric plasma structures in magnetically confined plasmas. They
   are particularly useful for studying stationary perturbations or

   NSTX tokamaks to elucidate the static edge magnetic structure during the
   application of 3D perturbations. To support the design of the proposed
   diagnostics, a synthetic diagnostic model was developed using the

   in good agreement with the measurements from an existing tangential SXR
   camera diagnostic on NSTX. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Study Objective. To determine the pharmacokinetics of intravenous
   peramivir-an investigational neuraminidase inhibitor for the treatment
   of 2009 H1N1 infection or nonsubtypable influenza A thought to be the
   2009 H1N1 virus in patients concurrently receiving continuous renal
   replacement therapy (CRRT).
   Design. Pharmacokinetic analysis.
   Setting. Critical care unit at a university-affiliated hospital.
   Patients. Two critically ill women with 2009 H1N1 influenza A treated
   with compassionate-use intravenous peramivir administered as a daily
   infusion of 600 mg over 30 minutes while receiving continuous venovenous
   hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), a form of CRRT.
   Measurements and Main Results. Plasma samples were collected from the
   two patients before and 30 minutes after the fourth (first patient) and
   ninth (second patient) peramivir infusion to estimate minimum (C-min)
   and maximum (C-max) plasma concentrations, respectively. Two additional
   postinfusion concentrations were measured from each patient to estimate
   noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters of peramivir while receiving
   CVVHDF. In the two patients, respectively, C-min was 2170 and 251 ng/ml,
   C-max was 18,400 and 20,300 ng/ml, area under the plasma concentration
   time curve from 0-24 hours (AUC(0-24)) was 178,000 and 94,400
   ng.hour/ml, drug clearance was 56 and 106 ml/minutes, and plasma
   half-life was 7.6 and 3.7 hours. The volume of distribution adjusted for
   ideal body weight at steady state was 0.51 and 0.54 L/kg, respectively.
   Conclusion. The first patient had a slower peramivir plasma clearance
   compared with the second patient, but both patients had higher peramivir
   clearances as calculated from AUC(0-24) than those predicted by CRRT.
   Thus, the dosage of intravenous peramivir was appropriate in these
   patients. Additional pharmacokinetic data are needed to confirm these
   results and help guide dosing in patients receiving various forms of
   CRRT.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design: A prospective diagnostic study to evaluate the use of
   intraoperative 3-dimensional (3D) imaging.
   Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of an intraoperative 3D imaging
   predicting trocar positions in osteoporotic fractured vertebral bodies
   before cement injection.
   Summary of Background Data: Malpositioned needles in vertebroplasty and
   kyphoplasty increase the risk of extravertebral cement leakage and the
   associated complications. This study was intended to clarify whether the
   position of trocars can adequately be determined before the cement
   application by an intraoperative 3D imaging.
   Methods: Between August 2006 and July 2008 the positions of 84 trocars
   in 42 fractured vertebrae between T11 and L5 were measured by
   intraoperative 3D imaging before injection of the cement. The external
   diameter of the needles was 9 to 10G. The positions of the trocars were
   classified in the axial plane by a new classification system.
   Results: Forty 3D scans covered 84 injection cannulae in 42 fractured
   vertebral bodies. The average duration of the entire scanning procedure
   was 7.1 minutes. All 3D scans could be evaluated with adequate degree of
   certainty. Intraoperative evaluation of the 3D scans showed 78 correct
   needle positions. Two trocars were in an acceptable lateral malposition.
   There were 4 medial malpositions that required revision. In total, 4.8\%
   of the trocars were positioned not acceptably. Postoperative computed
   tomography was performed in 17 patients. The positions of 34 needles
   determined by computed tomography conformed 100\% to the results of the
   3D scans.
   Conclusions: It is possible to reliably determine the position of
   trocars in vertebral bodies with the aid of an intraoperative 3D scan.
   This can lead to a reduction in the morbidity rates associated with
   puncture errors in kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty. The amount of time
   required is small. The increased radiation exposure is acceptable.}},

   to many nickel ore deposits, occurs in different crystallographic forms
   and compositions. A series of pyrrhotite samples derived from Canada,
   South Africa and Botswana whose mineralogy is well characterised, were
   selected here in order to develop the relationship between mineralogy
   and flotation performance. Using both oxygen uptake and microflotation
   tests, the behaviour of the different pyrrhotite types was compared in
   terms of the effect of pH and collector addition. Non-magnetic
   pyrrhotite was less reactive in terms of its oxygen uptake and showed
   the best collectorless flotation recovery. Magnetic pyrrhotite was more
   reactive and showed poor collectorless flotation performance that could
   be improved with the addition of xanthate collector, but only if it was
   not already passivated. These differences are interpreted to be a result
   of pyrrhotite mineralogy. This has implications that may aid the
   manipulation of pyrrhotite flotation performance in processing
   operations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gravity is the one constant, ubiquitous force that has shaped life on
   Earth over its 4.8 billion years of evolution. But the sheer
   inescapability of Earth's gravitational pull has meant that its
   influence on Earth's organisms is difficult to study. Neutralization of
   the gravity vector (so-called simulated microgravity) by random movement
   in three-dimensional space is the best option for Earth-based
   experiments, with spaceflight alone offering the possibility to assess
   the effects of an extremely reduced gravitational field (microgravity).
   However, the technical constraints associated with spaceflight introduce
   complications that can compromise the interpretation of microgravity
   experiments. It can be unclear whether changes detected in these
   experiments reflect additional spaceflight-related stresses (temperature
   shifts, vibrational effects, radiation exposure, and so on) as opposed
   to the loss of gravitational force per se. In this issue, Herranz et al.
   (2010) report a careful study in which the effects of simulated and
   actual microgravity on gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster were
   compared and the effects of the flight-associated stresses on the
   microgravity responses were investigated. A striking finding emerged.
   The additional stresses associated with the spaceflight experiment
   altered the response to microgravity. Despite controlling for the
   effects of these stresses/constraints, the group found that responses to
   microgravity are much stronger in the stressed/constrained background
   than in its absence. This interaction of gravity with other
   environmental influences is a novel finding with important implications
   for microgravity research and other situations where multiple stress
   factors are combined.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is continuation and extension of the previous article
   (Marczewska et al., 2006) {[}1] published in Journal of Fatigue in 2006.
   Our previous model of analysis (Marczewska et al., 2006) {[}11 was based
   on classical S-N curves and equivalent amplitude stress concept. Now
   more physically justified damage mechanics approach to fatigue analysis
   is applied. The analysis used in both our papers is based on particular
   application of the constitutive model described in Oller et al. {[}2].
   Hydraulic cylinders investigated under E.C. project ``PROHIPP{''} are
   analyzed. Modeling of fatigue crack propagation is performed. The new
   elements, in comparison with previous paper (Marczewska et al., 2006)11]
   are: application of the thermodynamic basics of damage mechanics
   approach to fatigue analysis with taking into account plastic
   deformations, introduction of damage evolution surface in fatigue
   analysis, modification of analytical form of S-N curve proposed in Oiler
   et al. {[}2] and fatigue crack propagation modeling using damage
   mechanics approach. As it was mentioned in Marczewska et al. {[}1] the
   ``marriage{''} of stress analysis and fatigue data is still one of
   deficiencies in the current European Norm EN 13445, chapter 18: detailed
   assessment of fatigue life {[}3]. Our paper is an attempt to further
   reduce this deficiency. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tritirachium egenum sp. nov., a biotrophic mycosymbiont, was found
   growing in association with a Penicillium rugulosum. This new species
   was unable to grow in axenic culture on traditional semi-synthetic
   culture media unless the growth medium was supplemented with a fraction
   of the culture filtrate of its host. The hot water extract of Alternaria
   alternata, containing the `growth factor' of several contact
   mycosymbionts (biotrophic contact mycoparasites) also supported the
   growth of T. egenum. Signs, particularly the functional equivalence of
   this extract and ferrichrome on the T. egenum growth, suggested that
   this growth factor, referred to in the literature as mycotrophein, could
   actually be a hydroxamate-type siderophore. Moreover, it was shown that
   this siderophore-dependent organism had a deficient metabolism
   requiring, in addition, an exogenous source of thiamine or a precursor
   molecule of thiamine. Among mycosymbionts of fungi, the nutrient
   acquisition strategy of T. egenum is new, because it did not live in
   close association with the cytoplasm of its host. Indeed, it is neither
   a haustorial mycosymbiont nor a contact mycosymbiont, the two groups
   into which the biotrophic mycosymbionts of fungi are classified.
   Moreover, an interfungal association based on the utilization of
   siderophores has not yet been reported.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic reverberation chambers can be used for multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) systems testing. Currently, the tests focus on
   parameters such as correlation, diversity gain, efficiency, etc., by
   using a vector network analyzer. In contrast with these passive tests, a
   novel way of MIMO systems characterization is described in this article.
   It consists on evaluating bit error rate (BER) levels of a MIMO
   WiMAX-OFDM system according to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) by
   establishing an active link between the transmitter and the receiver.
   The measurement process is set up in a reverberation chamber, where
   multipath frequency selective channels are emulated. The obtained
   results are compared to a reference case with single-input single-output
   (SISO) to evaluate the real improvements made by the studied system. (C)

Abstract = {{Addition of sugar surfactants, sucrose fatty acid esters and
   alkylpolyglucosides, to calcium phosphate cement designed for bone
   reconstruction is described. Thanks to their surface activity and
   through their adsorption at the surface of the calcium phosphate
   particles, they both induced a strong increase in the porosity
   (quantified by Image Analysis) and brought a very good workability.
   Other properties typically studied for these cements are reported,
   including setting times, compressive strength, cohesion in water, and
   effect of sterilization on these properties. The whole study brought
   good insight in the interest of adding these mild surfactants to improve
   several properties of the calcium phosphate cement, without impairing
   their function.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the management of cerebral arteriovenous shunts in neonates,
   infants, and children, with emphasis on our experience with pediatric
   cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The management of vein of
   Galen malformations is discussed in a separate chapter.
   An all-inclusive retrospective chart review of the endovascular surgery
   operative record database at the Hyman Newman Institute for Neurology
   and Neurosurgery at Roosevelt Hospital in NYC was conducted. All
   consecutive pediatric patients (newborn to 18 years of age) with
   intracranial arteriovenous shunts who presented from January 1, 2004 to
   June 16, 2009 were included.
   A total of 151 consecutive pediatric patients with intracranial
   arteriovenous shunts were evaluated from the period of January 1, 2004
   to June 16, 2009. This included 56 patients with vein of Galen
   malformations, 48 cerebral AVMs, 11 patients with pial arteriovenous
   fistulae, six patients with dural arteriovenous malformations, and 30
   patients with mixed intracranial vascular malformations. Forty-four
   patients underwent a total of 163 endovascular embolizations. The
   complications rate for endovascular embolizations was 6.7\% (11 in 163),
   5.5\% with temporary complications and 1.2\% with permanent
   complications. The mortality rate for the group of patients (excluding
   patients with vein of Galen malformations) that underwent endovascular
   embolizations was 0.0\%.
   Careful clinical observation and timely intervention are important in
   the management of pediatric patients with intracranial arteriovenous
   shunts. Trans-arterial endovascular embolization with liquid embolic
   agents is the treatment of choice for safe stabilization and/or
   improvement of symptoms in the group of pediatric patients with
   intracranial arteriovenous malformations.}},

Abstract = {{Using BLACKHAT in conjunction with SHERPA, we have computed
   next-to-leading order QCD predictions for a variety of distributions in
   Z,gamma{*} + 1, 2, 3-jet production at the Tevatron, where the Z boson

   agreement between the next-to-leading order results for jet p(T)
   distributions and measurements by CDF and D0. We also present
   jet-production ratios, or probabilities of finding one additional jet.
   As a function of vector-boson p(T), the ratios have distinctive features
   which we describe in terms of a simple model capturing leading
   logarithms and phase-space and parton-distribution-function suppression.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of IVB elements (Zr, Ti, and Hf) on the glass structure
   and on the alteration kinetics of soda-lime borosilicate glasses has
   been studied at various stages of glass leaching corresponding to the
   initial dissolution rate, rate drop, and residual rate regimes. The
   effect of these elements on the limiting mechanisms of the glass
   durability as well as the chemistry of both solution and alteration
   layer are inter-related, depending on the reaction progress. The effect
   of IVB elements on the glass structure was investigated using B-11 MAS
   NMR. The IVB elements are compensated primarily by Na rather than Ca, at
   the expense of tetracoordinated boron. The addition of HfO2 or ZrO2
   decreases the initial dissolution rate in a similar way. Moreover,
   adding ZrO2 limits the rate drop in saturated media. The initial
   dissolution rate decrease is less significant when Ti is added, and a
   quick drop of the dissolution rate is observed up to 4 mol\% TiO2. At
   low IVB element concentration, glasses containing Ti and Zr show
   different residual rates arising from the precipitation of magadiite
   (Na2Si14O29 center dot 11H(2)O), at the surface of Ti-bearing glasses.
   The influence of IVB elements on glass alteration indicates that, unlike
   Ti, Zr and Hf plays a similar role in the structure of borosilicate
   glasses. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent high-precision proper motions from the Hubble Space Telescope
   suggest that the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC,
   respectively) are either on their first passage or on an eccentric long
   period (>6 Gyr) orbit about the Milky Way (MW). This differs markedly
   from the canonical picture in which the Clouds travel on a
   quasi-periodic orbit about the MW (period of similar to 2 Gyr). Without
   a short-period orbit about the MW, the origin of the Magellanic Stream,
   a young (1-2 Gyr old) coherent stream of H I gas that trails the Clouds
   similar to 150 degrees across the sky, can no longer be attributed to
   stripping by MW tides and/or ram pressure stripping by MW halo gas. We
   propose an alternative formation mechanism in which material is removed
   by LMC tides acting on the SMC before the system is accreted by the MW.
   We demonstrate the feasibility and generality of this scenario using an
   N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation with cosmologically
   motivated initial conditions constrained by the observations. Under
   these conditions, we demonstrate that it is possible to explain the
   origin of the Magellanic Stream in a first infall scenario. This picture
   is generically applicable to any gas-rich dwarf galaxy pair infalling
   toward a massive host or interacting in isolation.}},

Abstract = {{Building on the fact that descriptive frames are coalgebras for the
   Vietoris functor on the category of Stone spaces, we introduce and study
   the concept of a Vietoris bisimulation between two descriptive modal
   models, together with the associated notion of bisimilarity. We prove
   that our notion of bisimilarity, which is defined in terms of relation
   lifting, coincides with Kripke bisimilarity (with respect to the
   underlying Kripke models), with behavioural equivalence, and with modal
   equivalence, but not with Aczel-Mendler bisimilarity. As a corollary, we
   obtain that the Vietoris functor does not preserve weak pullbacks.
   Comparing Vietoris bisimulations between descriptive models to Kripke
   bisimulations on the underlying Kripke models, we prove that the closure
   of such a Kripke bisimulation is a Vietoris bisimulation. As a
   corollary, we show that the collection of Vietoris bisimulations between
   two descriptive models forms a complete lattice. Finally, we provide a
   game-theoretic characterization of Vietoris bisimilarity.}},

Abstract = {{Radiocarbon-dated pollen and diatom records from Lake Kotokel in
   southern Siberia help to reconstruct the environmental history of the
   area since similar to 47 kyr BP. Pollen spectra composition and
   reconstructed biome scores suggest predominance of a tundra-steppe
   vegetation and variable woody cover (5-20\%) between similar to 47 and
   30 kyr BP, indicating generally a harsh and unstable climate during this
   interval, conventionally regarded as the interstadial within the last
   glacial. The short-term climate amelioration episodes in the glacial
   part of the records are marked by the peaks in taiga and corresponding
   minima in steppe biome scores and appear synchronously with the
   hemispheric temperature and precipitation changes recorded in the
   Greenland ice cores and Chinese stalagmites. Transition to full glacial
   environments occurred between 32 and 30 kyr BP. The interval at similar
   to 30-24 kyr BP was probably the driest and coldest of the whole record,
   as indicated by highest scores for steppe biome, woody coverage <5\%,
   absence of diatoms and reduced size of the lake. A slight amelioration
   of the regional climate at similar to 24-22 kyr BP was followed by a
   shorter than the previous and less pronounced deterioration phase. The
   late-glacial (similar to 17-11.65 kyr BP) is marked by a gradual
   increase in tree/shrub pollen percentages and re-appearance of diatoms.
   After 14.7 kyr BP the climate became warmer and wetter than ever during
   similar to 47-14.7 kyr BP, resulting in the deepening of the lake and
   increase in the woody coverage to 20-30\% similar to 14.5-14 kyr and
   similar to 13.3-12.8 kyr BP. These two intervals correspond to the
   Meiendorf and Altered interstadials, which until now were interpreted as
   part of the undifferentiated Bolling/Allerod interstadial complex in the
   Lake Baikal region. The increase in tundra biome scores and pronounced
   change in the diatom composition allow (for the first time) the
   unambiguous identification of the Younger Dryas (YD) in the Lake Baikal
   region at similar to 12.7-11.65 kyr BP, in agreement with the formal
   definition and dating of the YD based on the Greenland NGRIP ice core
   records. The maximal spread of the taiga communities in the region is
   associated with a warmer and wetter climate than the present prior to
   similar to 7 kyr BP. This was followed by a wide spread of Scots pine,
   indicating the onset of modern environments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma belong to a group of neoplasms
   designated as primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs). Secreted
   protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a matrix-associated
   glycoprotein that influences a variety of cellular activities in vitro
   and in vivo. In this study, we provide evidence that expression of SPARC
   cDNA induces autophagy in PNET cells followed by apoptotic cell death.
   SPARC-induced autophagy was morphologically characterized by (i) the
   formation of membrane-bound autophagic vacuoles (AVOs), (ii) increase in
   the levels of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and
   (iii) induction of the lysososmal enzyme cathepsin B. Cathepsin B, in
   turn induced mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and activated
   caspase-3, events that signify the onset of apoptotic cell death. In
   agreement with these observations, inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA
   reduced AVO formation and LC3 and inhibited apoptosis, suggesting that
   autophagy has a role in SPARC-mediated apoptosis. Blocking cathepsin B
   expression with a specific inhibitor of cathepsin B suppressed apoptosis
   but did not affect autophagy, which suggests that cathepsin B is a
   molecular link between autophagy and apoptosis. In summary, these
   findings show that SPARC expression induces autophagy, which results in
   the elevation of cathepsin B and subsequent mitochondria-mediated
   apoptosis. Cell Death and Differentiation (2010) 17, 1529-1539;

Abstract = {{Diabetes-related cognitive dysfunction is a consequence of changes
   within the central nervous system that are secondary to chronic
   hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and cholinergic dysfunction, and
   probably therefore anti-diabetics, anti-oxidants, and acetylcholine
   esterase (AChE) inhibitors were found to have beneficial effects in
   animal models. Quercetin, a bioflavonoid widely distributed in the
   plants is reported to be a potent anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant, AChE
   inhibitor, and memory enhancer. Therefore, we screened its influence
   against diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced
   diabetic rats using Morris water and elevated plus maze (EPM) paradigms.
   Thirty days after diabetes induction rats exhibited marked and
   persistent hyperglycemia, weight loss, higher escape latency during
   training trials and reduced time spent in target quadrant in probe trial
   in Morris water maze test, and increased escape latency in EPM task.
   Treatment with quercetin (5-20 mg/kg, p.o., twice daily, 30 days) in
   streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats prevented the changes in blood
   glucose, body weight, and performance in Morris water and elevated plus
   maze tasks. In another set of experiment, quercetin (40 mg/kg, p.o.,
   twice daily) treatment during training trials (31-35 days) markedly
   decreased escape latency and increased time spent in target quadrant
   during Morris water maze task. This treatment also decreased blood
   glucose levels, but had no influence on body weights. These effects were
   comparable to vitamin C (100 mg/kg, twice daily, 30 days) and donepezil
   (3 mg/kg day 31-day 35, during training trials), and devoid of any motor
   deficit and anxiety-like effect when tested in open field test. In
   conclusion, quercetin may provide a new potential option for prevention
   of the cognitive dysfunction in diabetes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is one of the most important oil crops in
   the world. However, biotechnological based improvement of peanut is far
   behind many other crops. It is critical and urgent to establish the
   biotechnological platform for peanut germplasm innovation. In this
   study, a peanut seed cDNA library was constructed to establish the
   biotechnological platform for peanut germplasm innovation. About 17 000
   expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were sequenced and used for further
   investigation. Among which, 12.5\% were annotated as metabolic related
   and 4.6\% encoded transcription or post-transcription factors. ESTs
   encoding storage protein and enzymes related to protein degradation
   accounted for 28.8\% and formed the largest group of the annotated ESTs.
   ESTs that encoded stress responsive proteins and pathogen-related
   proteins accounted for 5.6\%. ESTs that encoded unknown proteins or
   showed no hit in the GenBank nr database accounted for 20.1\% and
   13.9\%, respectively. A total number of 5066 EST sequences were selected
   to make a cDNA microarray. Expression analysis revealed that these
   sequences showed diverse expression patterns in peanut seeds, leaves,
   stems, roots, flowers, and gynophores. We also analyzed the gene
   expression pattern during seed development. Genes that were upregulated
   (twofold) at 15, 25, 35, and 45 days after pegging (DAP) were found and
   compared with 70 DAP. The potential value of these genes and their
   promoters in the peanut gene engineering study is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method to find the Fourier coefficients of a GL(3)
   automorphic form given its Casimir eigenvalues. The method uses a linear
   system derived from twisted functional equations. To demonstrate the
   correctness of our results, we test various conjectures, such as the
   multiplicativity of Fourier coefficients, an analogue of the Sato-Tate
   conjecture on the distribution of prime Fourier coefficients and the
   Riemann hypothesis. Similar work has been done by Miller ('A method for
   computing general automorphic forms on general groups', Preprint, 2008,
   http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3299v2) and Farmer et al. ('A direct serach
   for degree 3 L-functions'). As far as we are aware, our numerical
   results are the first examples of GL(3) cusp forms that do not arise
   from special cases of the Langlands functoriality conjectures.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of the European Union Water Framework Directive and
   associated national guidelines has emphasized the value of using biota,
   such as epilithic diatoms in streams, as indicators of water quality.
   However, guidelines for evaluating diatom samples have been established
   without explicitly evaluating their statistical robustness. We used
   epilithic diatom samples from 73 streams in northern Sweden and
   simulated the effects of variations in the counting sum size and
   taxonomic resolution of classifications for two indices indicating
   pollution (Indice de Polluo-sensibilit, Sp,cifique, IPS) and acidity
   (acidity index for diatoms, ACID). Instead of the stipulated 400, we
   found that a count sum of 40 diatom valves for 50 streams, and 80 valves
   for 60 streams, would have been sufficient to obtain the same IPS index
   classification. The ACID index is more sensitive to count sum
   reductions, since the same classification would only have been obtained
   for 12 streams with 40 counted diatom valves or 24 streams with a count
   of 80 valves. Excluding rare taxa had negligible effects on the IPS and
   ACID indices. Excluding taxa occurring with less than 1.0\% frequency
   affected the IPS classification of only one stream, and excluding taxa
   with less than 2.5\% and 5.0\% frequencies affected those of just one
   and no streams, respectively. The ACID index was affected for none,
   five, and 12 streams, respectively. At least in relatively unpolluted
   regions such as northern Sweden, our simulations suggest that a
   simplified methodological approach with site-specific counting sum sizes
   and reduced taxonomical resolution could be adopted, taking into account
   the way sites are classified in relation to established class
   boundaries. The simplified method is a step forward in improving the
   cost efficiency for stream monitoring, as costs of diatom analysis to
   obtain identical IPS and ACID classifications of our streams could be
   reduced considerably. Before the simplified method can be widely
   adopted, further simulations including regions with a higher proportion
   of polluted streams are required.}},

Abstract = {{Background Recent data has shown that the use of neoadjuvant
   chemotherapy (NAC) significantly reduces tumor burden before optimal
   cytoreductive surgery (CS) and is associated with an improved overall
   survival (OS). The aim of our study was to evaluate response to
   treatment and survival of patients with advanced epithelial ovarian
   cancer (EOC) who received NAC followed by interval cytoreductive surgery
   (ICS).
   Methods Fifty-two patients with advanced EOC treated with NAC followed
   by ICS were retrospectively analyzed. Response to NAC, progression-free
   survival (PFS), and OS were evaluated. By using univariate and
   multivariate analyses, the predicted survival rates by the factors were
   analyzed.
   Results Median age of patients at diagnosis were 62 years (range 33-77).
   The serous cell type was the most common histology (98\%). The majority
   of patients (94\%) received a combination therapy of paclitaxel and
   carboplatin. A median of four cycles of NAC was administered. At the end
   of NAC, the clinical complete response (CR) with normal clinical
   examination and normal serum CA 125 level was achieved in 40 patients
   (77\%). Moreover, a radiological CR and a radiological partial response
   were obtained in 35 patients (67\%) and in 16 patients (31\%),
   respectively. ICS was considered standard in 45 (86\%) patients. Optimal
   cytoreduction could be achieved in 43 of 52 patients (83\%). After ICS,
   pathological CR was established in 15 of 52 patients (29\%). At the
   median follow-up of 25 months (range 9-102), 2-year PFS and OS were 31
   and 90\%, respectively. The median PFS time was 13.3 months (SE 1.1,
   95\% CI 11-15) and the median OS time was 47.5 months (SE 5.8, 95\% CI
   36.1-59). The univariate analysis showed that optimal or suboptimal
   cytoreduction and perioperative blood transfusion were important
   prognostic factors on OS for patients who received NAC. Patients treated
   with optimal cytoreduction had significantly better median OS (52.5
   months, 95\% Cl 45-60) than patients who underwent suboptimal
   cytoreduction (24.2 months, 95\% CI 11.3-37) (P = 0.001). Furthermore,
   the cytoreduction type (optimal vs. suboptimal), surgical procedure
   (standard vs. non-standard), and perioperative blood transfusion were
   independent prognostic factors of OS by multivariate analysis (chi(2) =
   9.28, P = 0.002, HR 0.28, 95\% CI 0.003-0.37; chi(2) = 4.44, P = 0.035,
   HR 0.15, 95\% CI 0.026-0.87; chi(2) = 9.24, P = 0.002, HR 0.75, 95\% CI
   0.014-0.79, respectively).
   Conclusions This study demonstrates that NAC is associated with improved
   OS for patients with advanced EOC who received NAC followed by ICS.
   Additionally, our results showed that cytoreduction type, surgical
   procedure, and perioperative blood transfusion were independent
   prognostic indicators of OS for patients with advanced EOC who received
   NAC. Thereafter, NAC may be an alternative treatment to primary
   cytoreduction.}},

   Method: The literature was reviewed for other documented cases of
   spontaneous closure of traumatic tracheoesophageal fistula.
   Results: Acquired tracheoesophageal fistula may result secondary to a
   chemical burn from an alkaline disc battery impacted in the oesophagus.
   particularly when the presentation. and thus diagnosis, are delayed This
   condition is rare. The majority of such cases occur in children, and are
   conventionally managed with surgical repair We found only three
   previously reported cases in which conservative management was
   attempted.
   Conclusion: Non-interventional management should be tried initially for
   the management of paediatric acquired tracheoesophageal fistula, to
   permit closure by secondary intention}},

   various bonding mechanisms can be characterized by several parameters.
   They describe the quantum-mechanical reduction in the `electronic
   kinetic energy pressure' due to delocalization (sharing interference)
   and the increase in the `molecular potential energy pull' due to overlap

Title = {{Developing a modern pollen-climate calibration data set for Norway}},
Journal = {{BOREAS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Modern pollen-climate data sets consisting of modern pollen assemblages
   and modern climate data (mean July temperature and mean annual
   precipitation) have been developed for Norway based on 191 lakes and 321
   lakes. The original 191-lake data set was designed to optimize the
   distribution of the lakes sampled along the mean July temperature
   gradient, thereby fulfilling one of the most critical assumptions of
   weighted-averaging regression and calibration and its relative,
   weighted-averaging partial least-squares regression. A further 130
   surface samples of comparable taphonomy, taxonomic detail and analyst
   became available as a result of other projects. These 130 samples, all
   from new lakes, were added to the 191-lake data set to create the
   321-lake data set. The collection and construction of these data sets
   are outlined. Numerical analyses involving generalized linear modelling,
   constrained ordination techniques, weighted-averaging partial
   least-squares regression, and two different cross-validation procedures
   are used to asses the effects of increasing the size of the calibration
   data set from 191 to 321 lakes. The two data sets are used to
   reconstruct mean July temperature and mean annual precipitation for a
   Holocene site in northwest Norway and a Lateglacial site in west-central
   Norway. Overall, little is to be gained by increasing the modern data
   set beyond about 200 lakes in terms of modern model performance
   statistics, but the down-core reconstructions show less between-sample
   variability and are thus potentially more plausible and realistic when
   based on the 321-lake data set.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Background. Traditionally, stent thrombosis (STH) has been regarded as a
   complication of percutaneous coronary interventions during the first 30
   post-procedural days. However, delayed endothelialization associated
   with the implantation of drug-eluting stents (DES) may extend the risk
   of thrombosis beyond 30 days. Data are limited regarding the risks and
   the impact of this phenomenon outside clinical trials. Objectives. To
   evaluate the incidence, predictors and clinical outcomes of STH and
   premature discontinuation of thienopyridines after implantation of DES
   in real-world practice. Methods. We prospectively collected data from
   consecutive unselected patients who underwent at least 1 DES
   implantation at our center from February 2006 until January 2007. The
   patients were followed by a phone interview or by collecting data from
   admission files over the course of 2 years after the implantation.
   Confirmed and suspected STH was defined as accepted in the medical
   literature. Results. Three hundred fourteen patients were successfully
   treated with DES (436 lesions). At 20 +/- 6.7 months' follow up (median
   22 months), 14 patients (4.4\%) had STH (incidence density 2.7 cases/100
   patients-years). Five patients had early thrombosis (0-30 days), 5
   patients had late STH (31-360 days from the procedure) and 4 patients
   had very late STH (> 360 days). Five of the 14 patients with STH died
   (case fatality rate, 36\%). In multivariant logistic regression
   analysis, history of a non-cardiac thrombotic event was a risk factor
   for STH (p = 0.006, odds ratio {[}OR] 7.7, confidence interval {[}CI]
   1.8-32.9). Clopidogrel therapy lasting less than 3 months was an
   independent predictor of late and very late STH (p = 0.001, OR 10.8, CI
   2.7-42.9). Independent predictors of early discontinuation of
   thienopyridines (<= 3 months) were Arab ethnic origin (p = 0.005, OR
   19.2, CI 2.4-142), absence of cardiology follow up (p = 0.05, OR 4.7, CI
   1-23.1) and absence of explanation about the clopidogrel importance at
   the time of hospital discharge (p = 0.001, OR 10.8, CI 2.7-42.9).
   Conclusions. The incidence of STH at 22-month follow up in real-world
   patients was substantially higher than the rate reported in previous
   clinical trials. Subsidizing the cost of thienopyridines, providing a
   clear explanation to the patient and encouraging cardiology follow up
   may prevent premature discontinuation of thienopyridines after
   implantation of DES and reduce the incidence of STH after DES
   implantation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The statistical method of motor unit number estimation (MUNE)
   assumes that all motor unit potentials (MUPs) have the same size. The
   present study aims to evaluate the consequences of this assumption as
   well as its implications for the validity of statistical MUNEs.
   Methods: We performed statistical and multiple point stimulation (MPS)
   MUNE with an array of 120 electrodes on the thenar muscles of 15 healthy
   subjects. These recordings allow isolation and quantification of the
   effect of non-uniform MUP size on MUNE, because the differences in
   submaximal CMAP size (and, hence, in MUNE) between electrodes are due
   almost entirely to differences in (summed) MUP size.
   Results: We found no correlation between statistical and MPS MUNEs.
   Statistical MUNEs proved very sensitive to small variations in the
   ``bandwidth{''} (variance) of the response series; MUNEs from electrodes
   only 8 mm apart could deviate by as much as 60\%. This variation in
   bandwidth resulted from spatial (and, hence, size) differences between
   the contributing MUPs.
   Conclusions: Statistical MUNEs are very sensitive to violation of the
   uniform MUP-size assumption, to an extent that blurs any correlation
   with MPS MUNE in healthy subjects.
   Significance: Statistical MUNE cannot be used to detect mild to moderate
   motor unit losses. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical

   postpartum depression, namely: pre-eclampsia (adjusted OR, aOR 2.58,
   95\% CI 1.30-5.14), hospitalization during pregnancy (aOR 2.25, 95\% CI
   1.19-4.26), emergency caesarean section (aOR 1.53, 95\% CI 1.02-2.31),
   suspicion of fetal distress (aOR 1.56, 95\% CI 1.08-2.27), a medically
   indicated delivery provided by an obstetrician (aOR 2.43, 95\% CI
   1.56-3.78), and hospital admission of the baby (aOR 1.45, 95\% CI
   1.10-1.92). Unplanned pregnancy, thrombosis, meconium-stained amniotic
   fluid, and Apgar score were not associated with postpartum depression
   after adjustment for confounding factors, such as pre-existing
   psychopathological symptoms and sociodemographic characteristics. The
   risk of postpartum depression increased with the number of perinatal
   complications women experienced (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions
   We showed that several pregnancy and delivery complications present a
   risk for women's mental health in the postpartum period. Obstetricians,
   midwives, general practitioners, and staff at baby well clinics should
   be aware that women who experienced perinatal complications-especially
   those with a number of perinatal complications-are at risk for
   developing postpartum depression.}},

Abstract = {{Missing data is a recurrent issue in epidemiology where the infection
   process may be partially observed. Approximate Bayesian computation
   (ABC), an alternative to data imputation methods such as Markov chain
   Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration, is proposed for making inference in
   epidemiological models. It is a likelihood-free method that relies
   exclusively on numerical simulations. ABC consists in computing a
   distance between simulated and observed summary statistics and weighting
   the simulations according to this distance. We propose an original
   extension of ABC to path-valued summary statistics, corresponding to the
   cumulated number of detections as a function of time. For a standard
   compartmental model with Suceptible, Infectious and Recovered
   individuals (SIR), we show that the posterior distributions obtained
   with ABC and MCMC are similar. In a refined SIR model well suited to the
   HIV contact-tracing data in Cuba, we perform a comparison between ABC
   with full and binned detection times. For the Cuban data, we evaluate
   the efficiency of the detection system and predict the evolution of the
   HIV-AIDS disease. In particular, the percentage of undetected infectious
   individuals is found to be of the order of 40\%.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic migraine (CM) is a prevalent and disabling neurological
   disorder. Few prophylactic treatments for CM have been investigated.
   OnabotulinumtoxinA, which inhibits the release of nociceptive mediators,
   such as glutamate, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide, has
   been evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled studies for the
   preventive treatment of a variety of headache disorders, including CM.
   These studies have yielded insight into appropriate patient selection,
   injection sites, dosages, and technique. Initial approaches used a set
   of fixed sites for the pericranial injections. However, the treatment
   approach evolved to include other sites that corresponded to the
   location of pain and tenderness in the individual patient in addition to
   the fixed sites. The Phase III REsearch Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis
   Therapy (PREEMPT) injection paradigm uses both fixed and follow-the-pain
   sites, with additional specific follow-the-pain sites considered
   depending on individual symptoms. The PREEMPT paradigm for injecting
   onabotulinumtoxinA has been shown to be safe, well-tolerated, and
   effective in well-designed, controlled clinical trials and is the
   evidence-based approach recommended to optimize clinical outcomes for
   patients with CM.}},

Abstract = {{Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a synthetic fluoropolymer used in
   numerous industrial applications. It is often referred to by its

   measured employing differential scanning calorimetry. The thermal
   expansion and the density changes were determined employing pushrod
   dilatometry. The viscoelastic properties (storage and loss modulus) were
   analyzed using dynamic mechanical analysis. The thermal diffusivity was
   measured using the laser flash technique. Combining thermal diffusivity
   data with specific heat and density allows calculation of the thermal
   conductivity of the polymer. Measurements were carried out from - 125 A
   degrees C up to 150 A degrees C. Additionally, measurements of the
   mechanical properties were carried out down to -A 170 A degrees C. The
   specific heat tests were conducted into the fully molten regions up to

   with cerebellar ataxia
   Patients and methods - Cerebral MRI of 158 patients with cerebellar
   ataxia and no supraten tonal abnormality were examined according to a
   new categorization system based on posterior fossa imaging The clinical
   and radiological findings were confronted to biochemical and/or genetic
   results using the MR cerebellar algorithm Seven groups of cerebellar MRI
   pattern were described vermian dysgenesis (n=27) cerebellar hypoplasia
   (n=15) hemispheric cerebellar dysgenesis (n=6) unilateral hemispheric
   atrophy (n=5) global cerebellar atrophy (n=84) signal abnormalities
   (n=11) and normal MRI (n=10) Cerebellar hypoplasia vermian dysgenesis
   and hemispheric cerebellar dysgenesis groups were classified as
   malformative disorders Global atrophy and signal abnormality groups were
   classified as metabolic disorders
   Results - In the vermian dysgenesis group a specific genetic diagnosis
   was obtained in eight children (8/27) and all of the mutated genes (AHI1
   (JBS3) CEP290 (JBS5) TMEM67 (JBS6) and RPGRIP1L (JBS7)) are involved in
   primary cilia function In the group of pontocerebellar hypoplasia
   specific genetic diagnosis was obtained in one patient (PCH2) (1/15)
   Thus nine of 42 children classified as malformative disorder had a
   molecular diagnosis Global atrophy and signal abnormality groups were
   classified as metabolic disorders specific biochemical was obtained in
   46/95 children In global atrophy group respiratory chain deficiency was
   diagnosed in 18 children (18/84) In 21 children a congenital disorders
   of glycosylation type la (CDG la) was diagnosed (21/84) and infantile
   neuroaxonale dystrophy (INAD) was diagnosed in one child In signal
   abnormalities group specific biochemical diagnosis was obtained in six
   out of 11 children five children with respiratory chain deficiency and
   one child with sulphite oxidase deficiency In hemispheric cerebellar
   dysgenesis and normal MRI groups no biological diagnosis was found for
   any of the patients In the group of unilateral hemispheric atrophy we
   hypothesized a clastic prenatal injury

Abstract = {{Background
   Many self-attending patients make inappropriate use of accident and
   emergency departments.
   Aim
   To determine whether a new care method consisting of the involvement of
   a GP during the day with the staff of. the accident and emergency
   department of an academic city hospital and application of the
   Nederlands Triage Systeem by a practice nurse is more effective than
   usual care.
   Design
   Before and after intervention design.
   Setting
   Accident and emergency department in the VU University Medical Center in
   Amsterdam.
   Method
   Participants were patients (n = 1527) attending the accident and
   emergency department without a referral, on weekdays from 10.00-17.00
   hours, from 1 November 2006 to 30 April 2007. The intervention consisted
   of a new care method that combined the involvement of a GP in the
   accident and emergency department and allocation of patients by triage
   to either the GP or the accident and emergency department physician.
   Main outcome measures were patient satisfaction, number and type of
   additional examinations, quality of diagnosis, process time, and
   treatment time.
   Results
   Patient satisfaction with the treatment increased significantly.
   Compared to the usual care method, this new care method resulted in a
   13\% decrease in additional examinations. The percentage of incorrect
   diagnoses (1\%), as a measure of quality of care, was similar with the
   two methods. The mean process time decreased from 93 to 69 minutes
   (P<0.001). The mean treatment time decreased from 60 to 35 minutes
   (P<0.001).
   Conclusion
   The new care method resulted in greater patient satisfaction and
   maintained the quality of care, with fewer additional examinations. It
   reduced both the process time and the treatment time.}},

Abstract = {{Single fast spin echo scans covering limited time frames are mostly used
   for contrast-enhanced MRI of atherosclerotic plaque biomarkers.
   Knowledge on inter-scan variability of the normalized enhancement ratio
   of plaque (NER(plaque)) and relation between NER(plaque) and gadolinium
   content for inversion-recovery fast spin echo is limited. Study aims
   were: evaluation of (1) timing of MRI after intravenous injection of
   Cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2-R) (expressed by human and mouse plaque
   macrophages) targeted micelles; (2) inter-scan variability of
   inversion-recovery fast spin echo and fast spin echo; (3) relation
   between NER(plaque) and gadolinium content for inversion-recovery fast
   spin echo and fast spin echo. Inversion-recovery fast spin echo/fast
   spin echo imaging was performed before and every 15 min up to 48 h after
   injection of CB2-R targeted or control micelles using several groups of
   mice measured in an interleaved fashion. NER(plaque) (determined on
   inversion-recovery fast spin echo images) remained high (similar to 2)
   until 48 h after injection of CB2-R targeted micelles, whereas
   NER(plaque) decreased after 36 h in the control group. The inter-scan
   variability and relation between NER(plaque) and gadolinium (assessed
   with inductively coupled plasma- mass spectrometry) were compared
   between inversion-recovery fast spin echo and fast spin echo. Inter-scan
   variability was higher for inversion-recovery fast spin echo than for
   fast spin echo. Although gadolinium and NER(plaque) correlated well for
   both techniques, the NER of plaque was higher for inversion-recovery
   fast spin echo than for fast spin echo. In mice injected with CB2-R
   targeted micelles, NER(plaque) can be best evaluated at 36-48 h
   post-injection. Because NER(plaque) was higher for inversion-recovery
   fast spin echo than for fast spin echo, but with high inter-scan
   variability, repeated inversion-recovery fast spin echo imaging and
   averaging of the obtained NER(plaque) values is recommended. Copyright

Abstract = {{The detection, analysis, and understanding of protein
   complexes/aggregates and their formation process are extremely important
   for biomolecular research, diagnosis, and biopharmaceutical development.
   Unfortunately, techniques that can be used conveniently for protein
   complex/aggregate detection and analysis are very limited. Using gold
   nanoparticle immunoprobes coupled with dynamic light scattering (DLS),
   we developed a label-free nanoparticle aggregation immunoassay
   (NanoDLSay) for protein aggregate detection and study. Glyceraldehyde
   3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a protein target used routinely in
   Western blot as a loading control, is demonstrated here as an example.
   Through this study, we discovered that GAPDH has a strong tendency to
   form large aggregates in certain buffer solutions at a concentration
   range of 10-25 mu g/ml. The strong light scattering property of gold
   nanoparticles immunoprobes greatly enhanced the sensitivity of the
   dynamic light scattering for protein complex/aggregate detection. In
   contrast to fluorescence techniques for protein complex and aggregation
   study, the protein targets do not need to be labeled with fluorescent
   probe molecules in NanoDLSay. NanoDLSay is a very convenient and
   sensitive tool for protein complex/aggregate detection and study. (C)

Abstract = {{Mullerian cysts or paramesonephric cysts arise from the fused embryonic
   ducts, which typically regress in the uterus. These cysts are usually
   located paravertebrally. We present an unusual case of a Mullerian cyst
   developing within the mesentery of the ileocecum that was successfully
   resected. The patient presented to our surgical unit with abdominal pain
   and swelling. She underwent all the necessary tests to rule out other
   pathologies before she underwent right hemicolectomy. The patient was
   discharged without complications. Histopathology confirmed the presence
   of female reproductive tract epithelium, which was conclusive of a
   Mullerian cyst or paramesonephric cyst. Mullerian cysts are rarely
   malignant, and they are usually treated surgically. The incidence of
   Mullerian cysts is one in 105,000, with almost equal sex distribution.
   Their unusual intraperitoneal location further demonstrates their

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To test whether the expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor
   2 (HER-2) is of prognostic value in a contemporary cohort of patients
   with urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder (UCB).
   PATIENTS AND METHODS
   Tissue microarrays of 198 patients were constructed and
   immunohistochemical stainings were performed on the primary tumours and
   on lymphatic nodal metastases. All patients were treated with radical
   cystectomy (RC) and regional lymphadenectomy for UCB. HER-2 expression
   was assessed using continuous HER-2 expression scores (ranging from 0.1
   to 3.9) generated using an automated cellular imaging system. Scores of
   >= 1.0 in at least 10\% of tumour cells were regarded as HER-2 positive.
   We correlated HER-2 scores with pathological and clinical variables,
   including disease recurrence and cancer-specific mortality.
   RESULTS
   Of 198 patients undergoing RC with lymphadenectomy, there was HER-2
   positivity in 55 primary tumours (27.8\%) compared with 44.2\% of the
   evaluable positive lymph nodes (P < 0.001). HER-2 positivity was
   significantly associated with the presence of lymphovascular invasion
   (LVI; P = 0.026). With a median (range) follow-up of 35.4 (1.3-176.1)
   months, 101 patients (51.0\%) had UCB recurrence and 82 patients
   (41.4\%) died from the disease. In multivariable analyses that adjusted
   for the effects of pathological tumour stage, grade, LVI, lymph node
   metastasis and adjuvant chemotherapy, HER-2 positive patients were at
   increased risk for both UCB recurrence (hazard ratio {[}HR] 1.955, P =
   0.003) and UCB-specific mortality (HR 2.066, P = 0.004) compared with
   patients with negative HER-2 expression.
   CONCLUSION
   A positive HER-2 status is associated with aggressive UCB and provides
   independent prognostic information for UCB recurrence and mortality.
   Assessment of HER-2 status can be used to identify patients at high risk
   of disease progression who may benefit from adjuvant HER-2-targeted
   mono- or combined therapy after RC.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: In the era of prostate-specific antigen screening and
   frequent cross-sectional abdominal imaging, concurrent prostate cancer
   and renal masses are being identified and treated. Minimizing patient
   morbidity and cost by avoiding separate surgical procedures is
   advantageous, provided technical feasibility, and safety data. Our goal
   was to assess the feasibility and safety of single-setting robotic renal
   surgery and prostatectomy. We present our initial experience.
   Purpose: To assess the feasibility and safety of single-setting
   concurrent robot-assisted renal surgery and radical prostatectomy
   utilizing the same port access scheme.
   Patients and Methods: From February 2009 to June 2009, we performed
   single-setting concurrent robot-assisted radical nephrectomy/partial
   nephrectomy and radical prostatectomy on two patients with synchronous
   kidney tumors and prostate cancer. Identical port sites were used during
   both aspects of the procedure with the exception of one additional port
   during prostatectomy. Prostate cancer clinical stage and Gleason scores
   were T1c and 6 and T2a and 7, respectively. Corresponding renal tumors
   were 5 cm, respectively.
   Results: Both operations were performed, with no conversion to open
   surgery. There were no intraoperative complications and the
   postoperative course was uneventful in both patients. Discharge was on
   postoperative day 2 and 3, respectively. Patient 2 had an episode of
   delayed bleeding on postoperative day 9, treated by selective
   angio-embolization. Mean operative time for nephrectomy and
   prostatectomy (135 and 139 minutes, respectively) and estimated blood
   loss (75 and 100 mL, respectively) were reasonable. We began with the
   renal portion utilizing a lateral decubitus position before
   re-positioning into the lithotomy position for the prostatic portion.
   Clamping time was 34 minutes during partial nephrectomy.
   Conclusion: Single-setting robotic radical/partial nephrectomy and
   radical prostatectomy is technically feasible and safe in properly
   selected patients who present with synchronous primary renal and
   prostate malignancies.}},

   cognition and learning, but the overall stress ``dose response curve{''}
   of experiential learning remains unclear. We sought to (1) identify the
   degree and time course of physiologic stress induced in physicians by
   simulation-based training (SBT), when compared with a traditional
   tutorial-based interactive-education training (IET) and (2) compare
   differences in stress responses to simulation activities among pediatric
   provider groups.
   Method: Twenty-seven gastroenterology physicians were randomized among
   six crisis resource management courses taught by SBT versus IET. Eleven
   RNs and four technicians participated in the SBT exercises. Heart rate
   (HR) and salivary cortisol (SC) levels were measured in all participants
   at four time points before, during, and after participation in the SBT
   sessions and at two time points before and after the IET sessions.
   Results: Physicians who underwent SBT (n = 13) demonstrated increased
   tachycardia at the end of the session (+ 17 beats/min), when compared
   with those in the IET group (n = 14) who demonstrated an overall
   negative response (-4 beats/min, P = 0.001). Similarly, physicians in
   the SBT group demonstrated increased SC (+0.140 mu g/dL, 70\% over
   baseline), when compared with physicians in the IET group who had a
   median decrease in SC (-0.015 mu g/dL, 20\% under baseline, P = 0.001).
   There were similar increases in HR in all participants after SBT, but
   technicians experienced a relatively smaller increase in SC compared
   with physicians and nurses.
   Conclusions: After high-fidelity SBT within the gastroenterology suite,
   clinicians independent of their role demonstrated increased physiologic
   stress levels-as measured by HR and SC levels-compared with traditional
   IET sessions. The study provides novel calibration data compared with a
   traditional baseline for future investigations aimed at further
   understanding the dose-response curve of simulation-based experiences to
   optimize emotionality, cognition, and learning. (Sim Healthcare

Abstract = {{Advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer is generally managed with
   cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and
   paclitaxel, achieving clinical complete remission in the majority of
   patients. However, most tumors recur, and are associated with
   progressive chemotherapy resistance. Techniques to optimize chemotherapy
   have included intraperitoneal administration and weekly scheduling of
   paclitaxel. Efforts to improve on the long-term results of primary
   therapy through addition of a third cytotoxic agent have not been
   successful, including extended maintenance, as well as strategies to
   overcome chemotherapy resistance. Limited data emerging from phase III
   trials using bevacizumab suggest some advantage in progression-free
   survival, particularly in the maintenance setting, and further data are
   awaited. At present, primary therapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel
   remains a well-tolerated standard regimen, including the option of
   weekly paclitaxel dosing, intraperitoneal delivery and neoadjuvant
   therapy in selected patients. Emerging biological paradigms will
   hopefully contribute to individualized treatment options in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To assess the reasons and perceptions of women who are offered
   a choice between karyotyping and standalone rapid aneuploidy detection
   (RAD) and to compare the impact of both tests on anxiety and
   health-related quality of life
   Methods In this prospective comparative study, women undergoing
   amniocentesis on behalf of their age or for an increased Down syndrome
   risk were offered a choice between karyotyping (group 1, n = 68) and
   standalone RAD (group 2, n = 61) Follow-up was 9 weeks post
   amniocentesis
   Results The most commonly cited reason for choosing karyotyping was
   obtaining as much information as possible, while for choosing standalone
   RAD, it was the short waiting time Prenatal screening (OR 7 09). no
   knowledge of karyotyping (OR 4 2). and an intermediate perceived risk
   for chromosomal abnormalities (OR 3 6) were associated with choosing
   standalone RAD There were no systematic differences in time of
   karyotyping and standalone RAD in terms of anxiety (P = 0 11). generic
   physical and mental health (P = 0 94, 0.52, P = 0 66, 0 07). personal
   perceived control (PPC; P = 0 69). and stress (P = 0 66)
   Conclusion Offering a choice between karyotyping and standalone RAD does
   not influence anxiety. stress. PPC. or generic health. Individual choice
   in prenatal diagnosis meets individual needs and thereby could reduce

Abstract = {{Traumatic injury to articular cartilage can lead to post-traumatic
   arthritis We used a custom pendulum device to deliver a single,
   near-fracture impact to the medial femoral condyles of rabbits Impact
   was localized to a region similar to 3 mm in diameter, and impact stress
   averaged similar to 100 MPa Animals were euthanized at 0, 1, and 6
   months after impact Cartilage mechanical properties from impacted and
   sham knees were evaluated by creep-indentation testing, and
   periarticular trabecular bone was evaluated by microCT and
   histomorphometry Impact caused immediate and statistically significant
   loss of cartilage thickness (-40\% vs sham) and led to a greater than
   twofold increase in creep strain From 0 to 6 months after impact, the
   ability of cartilage to recover from creep deformation became
   significantly impaired (percent recovery different from control at 1 and
   6 months) At 1 month, there was a 33\% increase in the trabecular bone
   volume fraction of the epiphysis beneath the site of impact compared to
   control, and increased bone formation was observed histologically Taken
   together, these findings demonstrate that a single, high-energy impact
   below the fracture threshold leads to acute deleterious changes in the
   viscoelastic properties of articular cartilage that worsen with time,

Abstract = {{Sodium selenite and sodium selenate are approved inorganic Se (selenium)
   compounds in human and animal nutrition serving as precursors for
   selenoprotein synthesis. In recent years, numerous additional biological
   effects over and above their functions in selenoproteins have been
   reported. For greater insight into these effects, our present study
   examined the influence of selenite and selenate on the differential
   expression of genes encoding non-selenoproteins in the rat liver using
   microarray technology. Five groups of nine growing male rats were fed
   with an Se-deficient diet or diets supplemented with 0.20 or 1.0 mg of
   Se/kg as sodium selenite or sodium selenate for 8 weeks. Genes that were
   more than 2.5-fold up- or down-regulated by selenite or selenate
   compared with Se deficiency were selected. GPx1 (glutathione peroxidase
   1) was up-regulated 5.5-fold by both Se compounds, whereas GPx4 was
   up-regulated by only 1.4-fold. Selenite and selenate down-regulated
   three phase II enzymes. Despite the regulation of many other genes in an
   analogous manner, frequently only selenate changed the expression of
   these genes significantly. In particular, genes involved in the
   regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, intermediary metabolism and
   those involved in Se-deficiency disorders were more strongly influenced
   by selenate. The comparison of selenite-and selenate-regulated genes
   revealed that selenate may have additional functions in the protection
   of the liver, and that it may be more active in metabolic regulation. In
   our opinion the more pronounced influence of selenate compared with
   selenite on differential gene expression results from fundamental
   differences in the metabolism of these two Se compounds.}},

Title = {{Mechanical lock of the lumen: researching towards new approaches for

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{269-273}},
Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Theoretical proposals for two new vascular access devices (a
   central venous catheter (CVC) and a peripheral vascular access system,
   PVAS) are presented in this article.
   Methods: The new CVC concept is based on a mechanical obturator used for
   CVC locking. Compared to conventional locks, it should, theoretically,
   allow the reduction of bacterial contamination, biofilm and thrombotic
   formation. A new tunneling technique, based on a ``rigid tunnel
   sheath{''} providing a more stable connection, as compared to a
   traditional CVC cuff, and an increasingly protected exit site, allows
   CVC changeover to take place through the sheath; therefore, avoiding
   surgical intervention. PVAS, based on the same mechanical lock concept,
   is structured from four components: obturator, soft graft, rigid tunnel
   sheath and foldable sheath. The total graft length is about 80 mm, its
   inner extremity being uncovered to allow a gentle curve reaching the
   native vessel. The outer extremity and bifurcation are reinforced by a
   titanium rigid sheath together with a Dacron cuff. The obturator is
   protected, and several technical solutions have been considered to
   guarantee sterility: the ``accordion sheath{''}, the ``foldable
   sheath{''}, and the ``balloon obturator system{''}.
   Results: The major advantage of PVAS on CVC is the implant on the
   peripheral vessel which allows the saving of central veins and possibly
   avoiding life-threatening complications. As compared with an
   arterial-venous fistula or an arterial-venous graft, PVAS's main
   advantage should be the possibility of implanting even in
   ``desperate{''} cases, so avoiding fistula needle positioning. It could
   be indicated for pediatric or psychiatric patients, for home-based or
   frequent dialysis schedules. Lower hemodynamic stress should therefore
   reduce vessel damage, such as aneurism, pseudo-aneurism, intimal
   hyperplasia and cardiac overload.
   Conclusions: The development of prototypes is in progress to verify both
   device usefulness and safety in clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{A large research program in the Australian monsoon tropics has concluded
   that monsoon rainforests have expanded within the savanna matrix, a
   trend that has been emulated throughout the tropics worldwide. The
   driver of the northern Australian trend was not resolved, but it was
   suggested to be linked to a long-term trend towards wetter climates,
   atmospheric CO2 enrichment, and changed fire regimes. We review these
   findings with particular consideration of its analytical and evidentiary
   basis and plausibility of the global change hypothesis. Field validation
   has largely demonstrated that the aerial photographic technique that
   underpinned the previous research is reliable enough to detect
   rainforest expansion. Statistical modelling demonstrated that the
   expansion is related to sites with regionally low fire activity,
   although models are of low explanatory power reflecting the sketchy
   historical records of fire and feral animal impacts. Field studies show
   that current fire regimes adjacent to expanding rainforest patches are
   causing populations of the native conifer Callitris intratropica, an
   obligate seeder, to crash. Therefore, it is unlikely that changes in
   fire regimes, which have been deleterious to other fire-sensitive taxa
   and plant communities in the region, are responsible for the rainforest
   expansion. We conclude that the expansion of monsoon rainforests is most
   plausibly linked to the current wetting trend or elevated CO2
   concentration. Increases in either water availability or CO2
   concentration can potentially overwhelm the negative feedback between
   fire and rainforest cover that is responsible for the meta-stability of
   monsoon rainforest boundaries. However, further research at the
   continental scale, using aerial photography, tree rings and other
   proxies, is required to evaluate this hypothesis.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{441-448}},

Abstract = {{It is widely accepted that regions within the dorsal medial frontal
   cortex are involved in the control of voluntary action. However, recent
   evidence suggests that a subset of these regions may also be important
   for unconscious and involuntary motor processes. Indeed, Sumner et al.
   (Neuron 54:697-711, 2007) showed that two patients with micro-lesions of
   the supplementary motor area (SMA) and supplementary eye field (SEF)
   demonstrated an absence of unconscious inhibition as evoked by
   masked-prime stimuli, while pre-SMA damage had no such effect. Here, we
   employ fMRI and a similar masked-prime task to test whether SMA and
   pre-SMA are similarly dissociated in healthy volunteers. Reaction times
   (RT) revealed that responses to compatible trials were slower than those
   to incompatible trials (negative compatibility effect, NCE), indicating
   automatic inhibition in every participant. BOLD signals in the SMA were
   modulated by prime compatibility, showing greater signal for compatible
   trials, but there was no change in pre-SMA. There was also no modulation
   in the hand motor cortex (HMC). These findings imply that the SMA is
   involved in automatic suppression of manual motor plans.}},

Abstract = {{This article considers a minimum cost flow problem where arc costs are
   uncertain, and the decision maker wishes to minimize both the expected
   flow cost and the variance of this cost. Two optimality conditions are
   given, one based on cycle marginal costs, and another based on concepts
   of network equilibrium. Solution methods are developed based on these
   conditions. The value of information is also studied, and efficient
   approximation techniques are developed for the specific case of learning
   the exact cost of one or more arcs a priori. Finally, numerical results
   compare the solution methods developed in this work: the minimum mean
   cycle canceling algorithm performs better on all of the networks tested,
   although the equilibrium-based algorithm is more competitive for large
   networks. Solution sensitivity to input parameters is also examined, as
   is the performance of the approximation techniques for the value of
   information. Approximation techniques based on arc cost distributions
   were found to outperform those based on properties of optimal flows. (C)

Abstract = {{Built between 1979 and 1991, the housing complex Berlin-Hellersdorf was
   one of the last and most ambitious construction projects of the GDR.
   Located at the interstice between East and West Germany, Hellersdorf can
   thus be seen as a space conducive to thinking about the 1990s
   post-socialist transformations. The 1998 interdisciplinary project
   Peripherie als Ort. Das Hellersdorf Projekt picks up on this idea.
   Focusing on the works of Ulrich Wust and Helga Paris, who have
   contributed to the Hellersdorf Project, the following essay analyses the
   role photography and architecture play as indices of socio-political and
   spatial transitions. Entering into a dialogue with photography, East
   German prefab housing, commonly referred to as `Platte', becomes a
   mnemonic space whose parallactic perspectives are materially bound to
   the past without denying the changing present. As such, Hellersdorf
   presents itself as a complex space outside Berlin's city centre that
   invites reflections about the transformations that have taken place
   since German unification.
   Die zwischen 1979 und 1991 errichtete Gro ss siedlung Berlin-Hellersdorf
   war eines der letzten und ehrgeizigsten Wohnungsbauprojekte der DDR.
   Solcherart am direkten Ubergang von DDR zu BRD lokalisiert, kann
   Hellersdorf als Denkraum verstanden werden, anhand dessen sich die
   postsozialistischen Transformationsprozesse der 1990er-Jahre
   exemplarisch nachvollziehen und problematisieren lassen. An diesen
   Gedanken anknupfend, entstand 1998 das interdisziplinare Vorhaben
   Peripherie als Ort. Das Hellersdorf Projekt, an dem sich unter anderem
   die Fotograf/innen Ulrich Wust und Helga Paris beteiligten. Von ihren
   Arbeiten ausgehend, untersucht der vorliegende Essay die Bedeutung von
   Fotografie und Architektur als Indizes des Ubergangs. Im Dialog mit der
   Fotografie wird der Plattenbau zum parallaktischen Erinnerungsraum, der
   in einer materiellen Verbindung mit der Vergangenheit steht, ohne jedoch
   die Veranderungen der Gegenwart leugnen zu konnen. Damit bietet
   Hellersdorf einen komplexen Raum abseits des Berliner Zentrums, der zum
   Nachdenken uber die Transformationsprozesse seit der deutschen
   Vereinigung einladt.}},

Abstract = {{The plant Morinda citrifolia L. (noni) has been the focus of many recent
   studies due to its potential effects on treatment and prevention of
   several diseases. However, there are few in vivo and in vitro studies
   concerning its composition and antioxidant capacity. The aim of the
   present study was to determine the total polyphenol content (TPC) and
   antioxidant capacity of a juice commercialized as noni juice, but
   containing grape, blueberry and noni fruits. Commercial noni juice was
   compared against its separate constituents of blueberry and grape juice.
   Folin-Ciocalteu and DPPH center dot methods were used to determine the
   concentration of total polyphenol content and antioxidant activity,
   respectively. Commercial noni juice presented higher values of TPC
   (91.90 mg of gallic acid/100 mL juice) and antioxidant activity (5.85
   mmol/L) compared to its 5\% diluted constituents. Concentrated blueberry
   juice presented higher TPC and antioxidant activity than the other
   juices analyzed. Considering that the blueberry and grape juices account
   for only 10\% in the composition of commercial noni juice, it can be
   inferred that these two components contribute significantly to the
   antioxidant activity. Therefore, additional studies are necessary in
   order to elucidate the contribution of the noni juice as an antioxidant.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Previous reports on the anatomic portions of colon involved
   in cases of supposed ischemic colitis (IC) have been limited by the
   absence of confirmation of the true nature of the disease. This is the
   first anatomic study to define the patterns of colon involvement in
   which only cases with biopsy-proven or -compatible IC and in which the
   entire colon had been visualized at surgery or at colonoscopy were
   included. The aims of this study were to re-examine patterns of colonic
   involvement in IC using only cases in which the diagnosis was biopsy
   proven or compatible, and to examine the clinical features and outcomes
   with regard to the segments of colon involved.
   METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken of patients with IC who
   were hospitalized at Montefiore Medical Center from 1998 to 2009.
   Patients were identified using computerized searches of ICD-9
   (International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision) codes for
   colon ischemia, and patterns of colon involvement were then tabulated
   and categorized into five major groups: right colon, transverse colon,
   left colon, distal colon, and pancolon involvement. Patterns were
   classified based on the most proximal location of injury. Major anatomic
   patterns were then subcategorized into more specific segments of
   involvement. Only biopsy-proven or -compatible cases of IC in which the
   entire colon had been visualized at surgery or at colonoscopy were used
   in this study.
   RESULTS: A total of 313 cases of biopsy-proven or -compatible IC were
   identified. Patterns and frequencies of involvement were: right colon,
   25.2\%; transverse colon, 10.2\%; left colon, 32.6\%; distal colon,
   24.6\%; and pancolon, 7.3\%. Compared with all other patterns of IC, the
   right colon pattern was more likely to be associated with coronary
   artery disease (39.2 vs. 21.4\%) or end-stage kidney disease requiring
   dialysis (20.3 vs. 7.7\%), a longer hospitalization (median stay, 10 vs.
   6 days), a greater need for surgery (44.3 vs. 11.5\%), and the highest
   mortality rate (20.3 vs. 9\%). Patients with a left colon pattern were
   less likely to be operated upon, and had a shorter length of stay than
   any other pattern of IC. Hyperthyroidism, stroke, and chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were statistically significant
   independent predictors of mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: IC is typically a segmental disease, flanked by normal
   colon on either side of the affected area. Comorbid disease associations
   and severity of disease as reflected by length of hospitalization, need
   for surgery, and mortality vary with the segment involved. IC isolated
   to the right side of the colon is a more severe disease than IC
   affecting any other segment of colon.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the modular sutureless Arbor Trilogy Aortic Valve
   System (Arbor Surgical Technologies, Irvine, Calif), designed for
   minimally invasive aortic valve replacement.
   Methods: In a prospective multicenter study, 32 patients with severe
   aortic valve stenosis underwent aortic valve replacement with the
   Trilogy valve between 2006 and 2008. Concomitant coronary artery bypass
   grafting was performed in 6 patients. Transthoracic echocardiography was
   performed at baseline, at discharge, at 4 to 6 months, at 11 to 14
   months, and annually thereafter.
   Results: Valve implantation was successful in 30 patients. The procedure
   was converted to conventional aortic valve replacement in 2 patients.
   Mean bypass time was 111 +/- 42 minutes, and crossclamp time was 70 +/-
   23 minutes. Valve implantation took 21 +/- 7 minutes. The transvalvular
   gradients at discharge were 10 +/- 3 mm Hg (mean) and 20 +/- 7 mm Hg
   (peak), and the effective orifice area was 1.9 +/- 0.4 cm(2). At 2-year
   follow-up, gradients were 7 +/- 3 mm Hg (mean) and 14 +/- 4 mm Hg
   (peak), and the effective orifice area was 1.9 +/- 0.3 cm(2). There was
   no intraoperative mortality: Two patients died of causes unrelated to
   the valve during follow-up. One redo aortic valve replacement was
   performed at 22 months for prosthetic valve endocarditis.
   Conclusions: Sutureless aortic valve replacement is feasible and safe
   with the Trilogy System. After an initial learning curve, the modular
   valve design allows a more rapid and simple implantation compared with
   conventional stented tissue valves. The simplicity may also facilitate a
   greater adoption of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement by a
   broader spectrum of surgeons. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2010;140:878-84)}},

Abstract = {{Further clarification is needed to address the paradox that memory
   formation, aging and neurodegeneration all involve calcium influx,
   oxyradical production (ROS) and activation of certain signaling
   pathways. In aged rats and in APP/PS-1 mice, cognitive and hippocampal
   Ca2+ dysregulation was reversed by food supplementation with a high
   antioxidant blueberry extract. Here, we studied whether neurons were an
   important target of blueberry extract and whether the mechanism involved
   altered ROS signaling through MAP kinase and cyclic-AMP response element
   binding protein (CREB), pathways known to be activated in response to
   amyloid-beta (A beta). Primary hippocampal neurons were isolated and
   cultured from embryonic, middle-age or old-age (24 months) rats.
   Blueberry extract was found to be equally neuroprotective against A beta
   neurotoxicity at all ages. Increases in A beta toxicity with age were
   associated with age-related increases in immunoreactivity of neurons to
   pERK and an age-independent increase in pCREB. Treatment with blueberry
   extract strongly inhibited these increases in parallel with
   neuroprotection. Simultaneous labeling for ROS and for glutathione with
   dichlorofluorescein and monochlorobimane showed a mechanism of action of
   blueberry extract to involve transient ROS generation with an increase
   in the redox buffer glutathione. We conclude that the increased
   age-related susceptibility of old-age neurons to A beta toxicity may be
   due to higher levels of activation of pERK and pCREB pathways that can
   be protected by blueberry extract through inhibition of both these
   pathways through an ROS stress response. These results suggest that the
   beneficial effects of blueberry extract may involve transient stress
   signaling and ROS protection that may translate into improved cognition
   in aging rats and APP/PS1 mice given blueberry extract. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Both depression and substance use disorders represent major global
   public health concerns and are often co-occurring. Although there are
   ongoing discoveries regarding the pathophysiology and treatment of each
   condition, common mechanisms and effective treatments for co-occurring
   depression and substance abuse remain elusive. Mindfulness training has
   been shown recently to benefit both depression and substance use
   disorders, suggesting that this approach may target common behavioral
   and neurobiological processes. However, it remains unclear whether these
   pathways constitute specific shared neurobiological mechanisms or more
   extensive components universal to the broader human experience of
   psychological distress or suffering. We offer a theoretical, clinical
   and neurobiological perspective of the overlaps between these disorders,
   highlight common neural pathways that play a role in depression and
   substance use disorders and discuss how these commonalities may frame
   our conceptualization and treatment of co-occurring disorders. Finally,
   we discuss how advances in our understanding of potential mechanisms of
   mindfulness training may offer not only unique effects on depression and
   substance use, but also offer promise for treatment of co-occurring
   disorders.}},

   with the objectives of updating depictions of aggression, degradation,
   and sexual practices and comparing the study's results to previous

   pornography in both verbal and physical forms. Of the 304 scenes
   analyzed, 88.2\% contained physical aggression, principally spanking,
   gagging, and slapping, while 48.7\% of scenes contained verbal
   aggression, primarily name-calling. Perpetrators of aggression were
   usually male, whereas targets of aggression were overwhelmingly female.
   Targets most often showed pleasure or responded neutrally to the
   aggression.}},

Abstract = {{Sugarcane bagasse hemicellulose was isolated in a one-step chemical
   extraction using hydrogen peroxide in alkaline media. The polysaccharide
   containing 80.9\% xylose and small amounts of L-arabinose,

   enzymatic extracts from Thermoascus aurantiacus at 50 degrees C.
   Conditions of enzymatic hydrolysis leading to the best yields of xylose

   concentration in the range 0.5-3.5\% (w/v), enzyme load 40-80 U/g of the
   substrate, and reaction time from 3 to 96 h, applying a 22 factorial
   design. The maximum conversion to xylooligosaccharides (37.1\%) was
   obtained with 2.6\% of substrate and xylanase load of 60 U/g. The
   predicted maximum yield of xylobiose by a polynomial model was 41.6\%.

Abstract = {{While the protean career (Hall, 1976, 2002) has been lauded for its
   advantages in helping individuals adapt to changing career contexts, it
   is not clear how this career orientation may impact how others perceive
   a person's leadership ability. In this study, we hypothesized that those
   with a protean career orientation would receive higher leadership
   ratings from subordinates and superiors, but lower leadership ratings
   from peers, in part based upon social comparison theory. Using
   structural equation modeling, our hypotheses regarding subordinates and
   peers were supported, but not with respect to superiors, who, along with
   peers, rated those with a protean career orientation lower in terms of
   transformational leadership as measured by the MLQ We discuss potential
   reasons for these findings and the consequences for research and theory.
   Also, we examine the implications of this research for leadership
   development, workforce recruitment and retention, and possible
   generational significance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Membrane transporters constitute one of the largest functional
   categories of proteins in all organisms. In the yeast Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae, this represents about 300 proteins (similar to 5\% of the
   proteome). We here present the Yeast Transport Protein database (YTPdb),
   a user-friendly collaborative resource dedicated to the precise
   classification and annotation of yeast transporters. YTPdb exploits an
   evolution of the MediaWiki web engine used for popular collaborative
   databases like Wikipedia, allowing every registered user to edit the
   data in a user-friendly manner. Proteins in YTPdb are classified on the
   basis of functional criteria such as subcellular location or their
   substrate compounds. These classifications are hierarchical, allowing
   queries to be performed at various levels, from highly specific (e.g.
   ammonium as a substrate or the vacuole as a location) to broader (e.g.
   cation as a substrate or inner membranes as location). Other resources
   accessible for each transporter via YTPdb include post-translational
   modifications, K-m values, a permanently updated bibliography, and a
   hierarchical classification into families. The YTPdb concept can be
   extrapolated to other organisms and could even be applied for other
   functional categories of proteins. YTPdb is accessible at

   and to identify risk factors for its development. Method Parents
   completed PTSD questionnaires 3 and 9 months (N = 190) after PICU
   treatment. Risk factors included pretrauma data, medical data, social
   demographics and posttraumatic stress responses at 3 months. Results In
   total, 30.3\% of parents met criteria for subclinical PTSD and 12.6\%
   for clinical PTSD at 3 months. Clinical PTSD prevalence rates did not
   change over time. At 9 months, 10.5\% of parents still met criteria for
   PTSD. Number of earlier stressful life events, earlier psychosocial care
   and posttraumatic stress responses at 3 months predicted persistent
   subclinical and clinical PTSD. Conclusions PICU admission is a stressful
   event associated with persistent parental PTSD. Assessment of risk
   factors can facilitate detection of persistent PTSD for early
   intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical stress controls a broad range of cellular functions. The
   cytoskeleton is physically connected to the extracellular matrix via
   integrin receptors, and to the nuclear lamina by the LINC complex that
   spans both nuclear membranes. We asked here how disruption of this
   direct link from the cytoskeleton to nuclear chromatin affects
   mechanotransduction. Fibroblasts grown on flexible silicone membranes
   reacted to cyclic stretch by nuclear rotation. This rotation was
   abolished by inhibition of actomyosin contraction as well as by
   overexpression of dominant-negative versions of nesprin or sun proteins
   that form the LINC complex. In an in vitro model of muscle
   differentiation, cyclic strain inhibits differentiation and induces
   proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts. Interference with the LINC complex in
   these cells abrogated their stretch-induced proliferation, while stretch
   increased p38 MAPK and NFkB phosphorylation and the transcript levels of
   myogenic transcription factors MyoD and myogenin. We found that the
   physical link from the cytoskeleton to the nuclear lamina is crucial for
   correct mechanotransduction, and that disruption of the LINC complex
   perturbs the mechanical control of cell differentiation. (c) 2010

Abstract = {{The objective of this review is to introduce equine clinicians to the
   rapidly evolving field of clinical genomics with a vision of improving
   the health and welfare of the domestic horse. For 15 years a consortium
   of veterinary geneticists and clinicians has worked together under the
   umbrella of The Horse Genome Project. This group, encompassing 22
   laboratories in 12 countries, has made rapid progress, developing
   several iterations of linkage, physical and comparative gene maps of the
   horse with increasing levels of detail. In early 2006, the research was
   greatly facilitated when the US National Human Genome Research Institute
   of the National Institutes of Health added the horse to the list of
   mammalian species scheduled for whole genome sequencing. The genome of
   the domestic horse has now been sequenced and is available to
   researchers worldwide in publicly accessible databases. This achievement
   creates the potential for transformative change within the horse
   industry, particularly in the fields of internal medicine, sports
   medicine and reproduction. The genome sequence has enabled the
   development of new genome-wide tools and resources for studying
   inherited diseases of the horse. To date, researchers have identified 11
   mutations causing 10 clinical syndromes in the horse. Testing is
   commercially available for all but one of these diseases. Future
   research will probably identify the genetic bases for other equine
   diseases, produce new diagnostic tests and generate novel therapeutics
   for some of these conditions. This will enable equine clinicians to play
   a critical role in ensuring the thoughtful and appropriate application
   of this knowledge as they assist clients with breeding and clinical
   decision-making.}},

Volume = {{45}},

Pages = {{48-63}},

Abstract = {{Conventional high-order finite element methods are rarely used for
   industrial problems because the Jacobian rapidly loses sparsity as the
   order is increased, leading to unaffordable solve times and memory
   requirements. This effect typically limits order to at most quadratic,
   despite the favorable accuracy and stability properties offered by
   quadratic and higher order discretizations. We present a method in which
   the action of the Jacobian is applied matrix-free exploiting a tensor
   product basis on hexahedral elements, while much sparser matrices based
   on Q (1) sub-elements on the nodes of the high-order basis are assembled
   for preconditioning. With this ``dual-order{''} scheme, storage is
   independent of spectral order and a natural taping scheme is available
   to update a full-accuracy matrix-free Jacobian during residual
   evaluation. Matrix-free Jacobian application circumvents the memory
   bandwidth bottleneck typical of sparse matrix operations, providing
   several times greater floating point performance and better use of
   multiple cores with shared memory bus. Computational results for the
   p-Laplacian and Stokes problem, using block preconditioners and AMG,
   demonstrate mesh-independent convergence rates and weak (bounded)
   dependence on order, even for highly deformed meshes and nonlinear
   systems with several orders of magnitude dynamic range in coefficients.
   For spectral orders around 5, the dual-order scheme requires half the
   memory and similar time to assembled quadratic (Q (2)) elements, making
   it very affordable for general use.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Arteritis temporalis (AT) shows a variable course of the
   disease and may lead to transient or permanent visual loss.
   Patients and methods. In a retrospective consecutive case series 66
   patients with suspected AT were followed up of which 65 underwent
   arterial biopsy. Symptoms, therapy and complications were followed up.
   Results. Of the patients 32 (49.2\%) revealed a positive histological
   finding in unilateral (55.4\%) or bilateral (44.6\%) biopsy. Of these 3
   (9.4\%) suffered a severe or fatal outcome: two with extensive ischemia
   of the vertebrobasilar system (one fatal) and one patient died due to
   acute pancreatitis, a rare side effect of systemic steroid therapy.
   Conclusion. When systemically apparent, arteritis temporalis can
   progress to reduction of general health, cerebral ischemia and organ
   infarction. Therefore, AT is a serious disease requiring
   interdisciplinary, immediate diagnostics and prompt therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotube field effect transistors (CNTFETs) are of great interest
   for nanoelectronics applications such as nonvolatile memory elements

   investigate their fundamental operation from combined transport,
   electrostatic scanning probe techniques and atomistic simulations. We
   experimentally demonstrate operating devices with threshold voltages
   shifts opposite to conventional gating and with almost unchanged
   hysteresis. The former effect is quantitatively understood as the
   emission of a delocalized image charge pattern in the nanotube
   environment, in response to local charge storage, while the latter
   effect points out the dominant dipolar nature of hysteresis in CNTFETs.
   We propose a simple model for charge sensing using CNTFETs, based on the
   redistribution of the nanotube image charges. This model could be
   extended to gas or biosensing, for example.}},

   element code for the advanced optimal design of stiffened composite
   panels of an aircraft fuselage. The BOSS quattro, a task manager and
   optimization toolbox, is used for defining and running the optimization
   problem. The objective function to be minimized is the weight, and the
   restrictions depend on structural stability requirements, such as
   buckling and collapse. The design variables are the panel and stringer
   thicknesses of the conventional proportions (i.e. 0 degrees, 90 degrees
   and +/- 45 degrees) in a homogenized laminate. Since a collapse analysis
   introduces geometric nonlinearities into the design process, the
   function evaluation can take a long time. In order to obtain a rapid
   optimal solution, a gradient-based method is used, and the first order
   derivatives need to be computed, in this case with an original
   semianalytical approach. The sensitivity analysis of buckling and
   collapse is reviewed. Numerical tests on an industrial case study
   demonstrate the possibility and the reliability of the approach. Solving
   such problems is clearly difficult and remains a challenge. Through the
   applications, this paper provides the opportunity to discuss convergence

   potential for developing bad habits and misunderstandings, and for
   overestimating one's preparedness for practice.
   Method
   This nonsystematic review reflects on the literatures that speak to the
   advantages of self-guided learning, explores the metacognition
   literature to understand what trainees do spontaneously when
   self-guiding their learning, and reexamines the advantages of supervised
   learning.
   Results
   Those literatures are combined in an effort to reorient our questions
   when considering the concept of self-guided learning.
   Conclusions
   The authors propose that future research should ask questions that focus
   on our understanding of trainees' natural propensities while learning in
   the unsupervised context and on exploring conditions that will maximize
   the educational benefit of self-guided learning.}},

Abstract = {{Augmentation therapy with serotonin-1A receptor (5-HT1A) partial
   agonists has been suggested to ameliorate psychotic symptoms in patients
   with schizophrenia.
   The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of repeated
   administration of tandospirone (0.05 and 5 mg/kg) on locomotor activity
   in a novel environment and on sensorimotor gating in rats treated with
   the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801, which has been used
   in animal models of schizophrenia. Furthermore, we sought to determine
   whether the effect of tandospirone on these behavioural measures is
   blocked by WAY 100635 (0.3 mg/kg), a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, and
   whether there is an interaction between haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg; a
   dopamine-D2 receptor antagonist) and tandospirone.
   Tandospirone at 5 mg/kg, but not 0.05 mg/kg, decreased locomotor
   activity in saline or MK-801-treated rats, which were not affected by
   co-treatment with WAY 100635. Haloperidol decreased locomotion both in
   saline and MK-801-treated animals, and this effect was not evident in
   the latter group receiving the higher dose of tandospirone. Tandospirone
   (5 mg/kg)-induced disruption of sensorimotor gating in saline or
   MK-801-treated animals was reversed by WAY-100635, but not by
   haloperidol.
   These findings suggest that behavioural changes induced by tandospirone
   are not fully blocked by 5-HT1A antagonists and that tandospirone (5
   mg/kg) potentiates the effect of MK-801. Overall, these findings point
   to an interaction between NMDA and 5-HT(1A) receptors. Part of the
   effect of tandospirone on locomotor activity may be mediated by the
   actions of its active metabolites on other neurotransmitter systems.}},

Pages = {{64-72}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Several ionic liquids have been shown to act as suppressors of protein
   aggregation and to effectively promote the in vitro refolding of
   denatured proteins. In this work, the influence of the anion of these
   organic salts on their performance as refolding enhancers was tested,
   using a series of N-ethyl-N'-methyl imidazolium (EMIM) salts. Variation
   of the anion had a profound effect on the renaturation of the
   recombinant plasminogen activator rPA, which served as a model protein.
   The effect was roughly correlated with the stability of proteins in the
   tested aqueous ionic liquid solutions. Strongly destabilizing anions
   with higher alkyl substitutions like, e.g., hexyl sulfate were unable to
   promote protein refolding. However, the dimethyl and diethyl phosphate
   salts, which are known to be quite compatible with protein stability,
   also effectively suppressed renaturation, while alkylated sulfate anions
   with the same influence on protein stability did promote in vitro
   refolding. Only ionic liquid co-solvent systems with an intermediate
   capacity for solubilizing the proteinogenic amino acid tryptophan were
   found to permit effective renaturation of the model protein rPA. The
   most effective refolding enhancer among the tested ionic liquids was
   EMIM chloride. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2141-2144}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective. To determine whether the mortality in a cohort of patients
   with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) from a single center in the UK is
   significantly different from the general UK population.
   Methods. Patients who were entered onto the PsA database at the Royal
   National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, Bath, between 1985 and 2007
   were included in this study. Information on patient deaths was collected
   retrospectively. The National Health Service (NHS) Strategic Tracing
   Service was used to establish which patients were alive and which had
   died. Date and cause of death were confirmed by death certificates from
   the Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths. A standardized mortality
   ratio (SMR) was calculated by matching the patient data to single-year,
   5-year age-banded England and Wales data from the Office of National
   Statistics.
   Results. In this cohort of 453 patients with PsA (232 men, 221 women),
   there were 37 deaths. Sixteen men and 21 women died. The SMR for the men
   was 67.87\% (95\% CI 38.79, 110.22), and for the women, 97.01\% (95\% CI
   60.05, 148.92) and the overall SMR for the PsA cohort was 81.82\% (95\%
   CI 57.61, 112.78). The leading causes of death in this cohort were
   cardiovascular disease (38\%), diseases of the respiratory system
   (27\%), and malignancy (14\%).
   Conclusion. These results suggest that mortality in our single-center
   PsA cohort is not significantly different from the general UK
   population. No increased risk of death was observed in this cohort.

Abstract = {{Details of cytology work in 103 US histology laboratories (histolabs)
   and in 200 from 18 other countries are presented. Data from 1345
   additional US cytology practices surveyed from 1985 to 2004 are also
   included. The average annual workload in 130 histolabs from the United
   States and 12 other countries combined is 32 200 cases. The average
   annual workload in 173 histolabs from Spain and 5 Hispano-American
   countries is 20 000 cytology cases, a workload that is significantly
   lower (P<.0005) than that in US laboratories. Gynecologic cases, with an
   average of 1.2 slides each, represent 79\% of all cytology accessions in
   all laboratories. The average annual workload per cytotechnologist (CT)
   is 6600 cases; this number is not significantly different between
   countries (P>.10 to P>.75) and is significantly correlated (P<.0008)
   with the laboratories' total workloads. In the United States, the
   average annual productivity per CT is 6700 cases with 1.8 slides each,
   for a daily screening of 55 to 60 slides. The annual benchmark is from
   7900 to 8700 cases, equivalent to 14 300 to 15 000 slides per each
   full-time CT position. The benchmark per cytology aide is 17 000 to 20
   000 cases. The number of CTs per histolab is significantly correlated
   (P<.0002) with its workload. In the United States, there is an average
   of 4 CTs and 2.7 cytology aides per laboratory, and the cytology tasks
   completed by the histology staff average 4.1 hours daily. The average
   turnaround time for cytology cases in the United States is approximately
   6 calendar days, with 90\% of all cases signed out between 7 and 8
   calendar days. In addition to the productivity benchmarks, the pathology
   leadership must address the ergonomic conditions of the work when
   filling a new CT position because muscular discomfort caused by the
   microscopy work is a common occurrence. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier

   concentrations were well correlated. The different lower cut-off
   diameters (0.25 and 0.3 mu m) give an average difference of 23.5\%. Both
   detect less than 10\% of the total particle concentration (0.01-1 pm;

   differences are <10\%. OPC number size distributions were converted to
   mass concentrations using instrument-specific factors given by the

   OPC1.109 and (in case of OPC1.109) much lower than those measured with

Abstract = {{Although shoulder instability is common in young athletes, there are
   limited prospective data to guide treatment for competitive athletes who
   sustain a dislocation mid-season. The management of athletes during
   their competitive season requires an understanding of the natural
   history of shoulder instability, the specific needs of the injured
   athlete (eg, specific sport, player position), and the duration of
   treatment. Rehabilitation can enable an athlete with a shoulder
   dislocation to return to play within 3 weeks of injury. Bracing is an
   option, but it can result in restricted glenohumeral motion and thereby
   possibly affect performance. Surgical stabilization should be considered
   for the athlete with recurrent instability or inability to perform;
   however, this frequently results in the termination of the player's
   season. In this article, we review the available literature to help
   guide physicians treating athletes with shoulder instability.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To evaluate the extent to which ischaemic placental disease
   (IPD) - defined as women or newborns diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, small
   for gestational age (SGA), or abruption, is associated with preterm
   birth in twin gestations.
   Methods. A population-based study of women who delivered twin live
   births and stillbirths at 20-44 weeks gestation from 1995-2004 in the US
   was performed (n = 1,105,666). We compared the frequency of IPD in term
   and preterm (<37 weeks) twin births. SGA was defined as twins with
   birthweight <10th percentile for gestational age, and corrected for
   infant sex. The association between IPD and preterm birth was expressed
   as hazard ratio, derived from Cox proportional hazard regression models
   after adjusting for potential confounders.
   Results. The overall rate of twin preterm birth was 57\%. IPD was
   present in 20\% of twin preterm births in comparison to a rate of 16\%
   at term. Both pre-eclampsia and abruption, but not SGA, were associated
   with increased preterm birth rates. Women with two or more of the IPD
   conditions were more likely to deliver at preterm than at term
   gestations.
   Conclusion. In comparison to twin births delivered at term, IPD is more
   common in preterm births. Efforts to understand the role of IPD in twin
   gestations based on preterm birth subtypes may reveal important
   insights.}},

Abstract = {{P>During range-advance, individuals on the expanding edge of the
   population face a unique selective environment. In this study, we use a
   three-trait trade-off model to explore the evolution of dispersal,
   reproduction and competitive ability during range expansion. We show
   that range expansion greatly affects the evolution of life-history
   traits due to differing selection pressures at the front of the range
   compared with those found in stationary and core populations. During
   range expansion, dispersal and reproduction are selected for on the
   expanding population front, whereas traits associated with fitness at
   equilibrium density (competitive ability) show dramatic declines.
   Additionally, we demonstrate that the presence of a competing species
   can considerably reduce the extent to which dispersal is selected
   upwards at an expanding front. These findings have important
   implications for understanding both the rate of spread of invasive
   species and the range-shifting dynamics of native species in response to

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to establish the appropriated

   The evaluation was performed in 270 leaves, which were randomly

   after the plant emergence (DAE). In laboratory, the length, width and
   area of each leaf were measured by a leaf area meter (model LI 3100).
   The data were submitted to a regression analysis with the AF value as a
   dependent variable and the leaf length, width, the product of both (CL),
   and the square product (CL)(2) values as independent variables. Potato
   plant LA was more precisely estimated using measures of length and
   width: AF = 0,369335{*}{*}CL + 10,6923 (R-2 = 0,92) to 21 DAE and AF =
   0,470971{*}{*}CL 16,3432 (R-2 = 0,86) to 50 DAE. With the obtained

Abstract = {{While vigilance is a notion well-accepted by neuroscientists,
   consciousness which necessarily involves mental subjectivity may often
   be rejected whenever animals are concerned. In this brief review and
   against this attitude, we managed to discuss on consciousness, precisely
   including animals. Based on Ned Block's model, we describe some
   classical divisions of human consciousness, distinguishing primary
   consciousness, subdivided into phenomenal and operational, and
   auto-consciousness (or meta-consciousness), also with two subdivisions,
   reflexive and auto-consciousness. Extending it to animals, we considered
   here and briefly discussed three major issues: i) primary consciousness
   begins at a certain, still to be determined, phylogenetic level; ii) on
   the other hand, elementary signs of auto-consciousness are only seizable
   at very much higher evolutionary levels, mainly in sub-human primates;
   iii) along the evolutionary scale, conscious subjective pain appears at
   the same level as primary consciousness.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Since the discovery of place cells - single pyramidal neurons that
   encode spatial location - it has been hypothesized that the hippocampus
   may act as a cognitive map of known environments. This putative function
   has been extensively modeled using auto-associative networks, which
   utilize rate-coded synaptic plasticity rules in order to generate strong
   bi-directional connections between concurrently active place cells that
   encode for neighboring place fields. However, empirical studies using
   hippocampal cultures have demonstrated that the magnitude and direction
   of changes in synaptic strength can also be dictated by the relative
   timing of pre- and post-synaptic firing according to a spike-timing
   dependent plasticity (STDP) rule. Furthermore, electrophysiology studies
   have identified persistent ``theta-coded{''} temporal correlations in
   place cell activity in vivo, characterized by phase precession of firing
   as the corresponding place field is traversed. It is not yet clear if
   STDP and theta-coded neural dynamics are compatible with cognitive map
   theory and previous rate-coded models of spatial learning in the
   hippocampus. Here, we demonstrate that an STDP rule based on empirical
   data obtained from the hippocampus can mediate rate-coded Hebbian
   learning when pre- and post-synaptic activity is stochastic and has no
   persistent sequence bias. We subsequently demonstrate that a spiking
   recurrent neural network that utilizes this STDP rule, alongside
   theta-coded neural activity, allows the rapid development of a cognitive
   map during directed or random exploration of an environment of
   overlapping place fields. Hence, we establish that STDP and phase
   precession are compatible with rate-coded models of cognitive map
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Objective:
   To examine whether measures of remoteness areas adequately reveal high
   need populations, measured against socioeconomic disadvantage and
   physician to population ratios.
   Design:
   Exploratory spatial analysis of relationships between remoteness areas,
   medical workforce supply and the index of relative socioeconomic
   disadvantage (IRSD). Bivariate analyses examined associations between
   remoteness areas and IRSD. From this analysis, a composite score of
   deprivation was constructed combining measures of remoteness areas,
   physician to population ratios and IRSD, and validated against health
   outcome measures. These measures included avoidable mortality per 100
   000, risk behaviour rate per 1000, diabetes rate per 1000. All analyses
   were conducted at the statistical local area level and weighted to be
   population representative.
   Results:
   The percentage of small areas and populations within the most
   socioeconomically disadvantaged quintile rose with increasing
   remoteness. However, 12.8\% of small areas within major cities and
   40.7\% of outer regional areas were also within the lowest socioeconomic
   quintile. There was a strong relationship between our composite score of
   deprivation and avoidable mortality, risk rate, diabetes rate and per
   cent Indigenous. Regression analysis examined the relationship between
   each element of the composite score and health outcomes. This revealed
   that the association between avoidable mortality and remoteness was lost
   after controlling for per cent Indigenous.
   Conclusions:
   Using remoteness areas alone to prioritise workforce incentive programs
   and training requirements has significant limitations. Including
   measures of socioeconomic disadvantage and workforce supply would better
   target health inequities and improve resource allocation in Australia.}},

   (eta(1),...,eta(k+1))(T) = 0, where eta(i)'s are log contrasts of the
   population variances. A box-type acceptance region is constructed to
   test the hypothesis H-0. Simulation results indicated that our method is
   generally superior to the Shoemaker and Levene tests, and the
   bootstrapped version of the Levene test in controlling the Type I and

Abstract = {{A novel base-mismatched oligonucleotide assay method based on label-free
   electrochemical biosensor was developed, in which the L-cysteine
   (Cys)-dihydroartemisinin (DHA) complex was used as a new electroactive
   indicator. In DNA sensor, Cys-DHA complex was initially formed on
   electrode surface by cathodic scanning, and target oligonucleotide was
   conjugated with Cys-terminated DHA indicator through electrostatic
   interaction under optimal pH. The subsequent sequence assay was
   responsive to hybridization recognition, which target oligonucleotide
   was captured by the surface-anchored DNA/Cys-DHA probe. The
   electrochemical signals of biosensor before and after hybridization were
   compared basing the measurements of semi-derivative linear scan
   voltammetry (SDLSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). On
   the basis of signal amplification of electroactive indicator and
   specific recognition of DNA probe, five target oligonucleotides with
   different mismatched bases were assayed, and a detection limit reached
   0.3 nM. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to visually
   characterize specific recognition spots of biosensor at nanoscale. This
   study demonstrated a new electroactive molecule-based,
   biomolecule-involved electroactive indicator and its application in
   recognition and detection of complementary and base-mismatched
   oligonucleotide. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were first synthesized via soya
   bean sprouts (SBS) templates under ambient temperature and normal
   atmosphere. The reaction process was simple, eco-friendly, and
   convenient to handle. The morphology and crystalline phase of the
   nanoparticles were determined from scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron
   diffraction (SAED), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra. The effect of
   SBS template on the formation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles was investigated
   using X-ray photo emission spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier-transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results indicate that spherical Fe3O4
   nanoparticles with an average diameter of 8 nm simultaneously formed on
   the epidermal surface and the interior stem wall of SBS. The SBS are
   responsible for size and morphology control during the whole formation
   of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. In addition, the superconducting quantum
   interference device (SQUID) results indicate the products are
   superparamagnetic at room temperature, with blocking temperature (TB) of
   150 K and saturation magnetization of 37.1emu/g. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

Abstract = {{Background: We aimed to define the potential of the fecal DNA assay as
   an alternative or in addition to the currently used immunochemical fecal
   occult blood test (iFOBT) for the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer.
   Methods: A total of 560 individuals aged 50 to 69 years with a positive
   iFOBT were recruited from an Italian FOBT regional screening program.
   Twenty-six were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, 264 with high-risk
   adenoma, and 54 with low-risk adenoma, whereas 216 subjects did not have
   premalignant or malignant lesions. Fecal DNA integrity was analyzed
   blindly by the fluorescence long DNA (FL-DNA) test.
   Results: iFOBT and FL-DNA were largely independent variables (rs =
   0.036, P = 0.42), with values ranging from 101 to 5,826 ng/mL and from 0
   to 515 ng, respectively. Median values of both variables were
   significantly higher in cancer patients than in patients with
   noncancerous lesions or in healthy individuals. Moreover, iFOBT and
   FL-DNA values were individually associated with a number of pathologic
   parameters. Sequential use of the diagnostic iFOBT and FL-DNA methods
   showed that fecal DNA provided more accurate diagnostic information and
   was able to identify subgroups at different risk of cancer in
   iFOBT-positive individuals.
   Conclusions: A combined approach based on FL-DNA and iFOBT evaluation
   could help to better identify colorectal cancers and to determine a
   patient's risk of harboring a preneoplastic or neoplastic lesion.
   Further evaluation in a screening setting is needed to confirm this
   hypothesis.
   Impact: Fecal DNA could be a useful tool to better predict cancer risk
   in FOBT-positive individuals. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 19(10);

Abstract = {{Aims The aim of this study is to describe the incidence and
   characteristics of neovascularization in the fellow eye of patients with
   retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP).
   Methods This is a retrospective study conducted on all patients with a
   diagnosis of unilateral RAP commencing treatment in a single centre
   between November 2002 and January 2010. Clinical biomicroscopic
   examination, fluorescein angiography, and if required, indocyanine green
   angiography, and optical coherence tomography were used to evaluate all
   patients.
   Results In all, 37 patients had a follow-up of >= 1 year, 28 >= 2 years,
   and 11 >= 3. Patients who developed RAP in the fellow eye were: 2 of 37
   (5.4\%) within 1 year of follow-up, 4 of 28 (14.2\%) within 2 years, and
   4 of 11 (36.3\%) within 3 years.
   Conclusion In our case series, the risk of neovascularization in the
   fellow eye of patients with unilateral RAP increased with time.
   Approximately one-third of patients with a 3-year follow-up developed a

Title = {{Non-Centered Spike-Triggered Covariance Analysis Reveals Neurotrophin-3
   as a Developmental Regulator of Receptive Field Properties of ON-OFF
   Retinal Ganglion Cells}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The functional separation of ON and OFF pathways, one of the fundamental
   features of the visual system, starts in the retina. During postnatal
   development, some retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) whose dendrites arborize
   in both ON and OFF sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer transform
   into RGCs with dendrites that monostratify in either the ON or OFF
   sublamina, acquiring final dendritic morphology in a subtype-dependent
   manner. Little is known about how the receptive field (RF) properties of
   ON, OFF, and ON-OFF RGCs mature during this time because of the lack of
   a reliable and efficient method to classify RGCs into these subtypes. To
   address this deficiency, we developed an innovative variant of Spike
   Triggered Covariance (STC) analysis, which we term Spike Triggered
   Covariance - Non-Centered (STC-NC) analysis. Using a multi-electrode
   array (MEA), we recorded the responses of a large population of mouse
   RGCs to a Gaussian white noise stimulus. As expected, the
   Spike-Triggered Average (STA) fails to identify responses driven by
   symmetric static nonlinearities such as those that underlie ON-OFF
   center RGC behavior. The STC-NC technique, in contrast, provides an
   efficient means to identify ON-OFF responses and quantify their RF
   center sizes accurately. Using this new tool, we find that RGCs
   gradually develop sensitivity to focal stimulation after eye opening,
   that the percentage of ON-OFF center cells decreases with age, and that
   RF centers of ON and ON-OFF cells become smaller. Importantly, we
   demonstrate for the first time that neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) regulates the
   development of physiological properties of ON-OFF center RGCs.
   Overexpression of NT-3 leads to the precocious maturation of RGC
   responsiveness and accelerates the developmental decrease of RF center
   size in ON-OFF cells. In summary, our study introduces STC-NC analysis
   which successfully identifies subtype RGCs and demonstrates how RF
   development relates to a neurotrophic driver in the retina.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Few data are available on pregnancy outcomes in women with
   acromegaly.
   Study Design: This was a retrospective multicenter study.
   Patients: The study included 46 women with GH-secreting pituitary
   microadenomas (n = 7) or macroadenomas (n = 39). Their mean age was 31.7
   yr (+/- 4.5 yr). Incomplete transsphenoidal surgical resection (n = 39)
   and pituitary radiation (n = 14) had been performed, respectively, 2.9
   +/- 2.6 and 7.3 +/- 4.2 yr before pregnancy. The patients were receiving
   dopamine agonists (n = 25) and/or somatostatin analogs (n = 14), and
   GH/IGF-I hypersecretion was controlled and uncontrolled in,
   respectively, 23 and 34 cases. Five pregnancies followed the fertility
   treatment.
   Results: Fifty-nine pregnancies resulted in 64 healthy babies.
   Gestational diabetes and gravid hypertension occurred in four (6.8\%)
   and eight (13.6\%) pregnancies, respectively, and both were more
   frequent when GH/IGF-I hypersecretion was not controlled before
   pregnancy. Visual field defects were diagnosed during pregnancy in four
   women, three of whom were diagnosed with acromegaly during the
   pregnancy. Seven women had isolated headache. Magnetic resonance imaging
   performed 3.9 +/- 0.3 months after delivery showed that the size of the
   adenoma had increased in three cases, decreased in two cases, and
   remained stable in 22 cases. Seventeen women breast-fed with no
   complications. Four women gave birth to a small-for-gestational-age
   infant; all had received somatostatin analogs, alone or in combination
   with dopamine agonists, during pregnancy. The mean IGF-I level fell
   significantly during the first trimester in 12 cases(before conception
   588 +/- 207ng/ml, first trimester 319 +/- 126ng/ml, P = 0.002), whereas
   the GH concentration did not change significantly.
   Conclusion: The following conclusions were reached: 1) pregnancy in
   women with active or uncontrolled acromegaly may be associated with an
   increased risk of gestational diabetes and gravid hypertension; 2)
   pregnancy is occasionally associated with symptomatic enlargement of
   GH-secreting pituitary macroadenomas; 3) changes in serum GH and IGF-I
   concentrations are variable during pregnancy, indicating that routine
   monitoring is not mandatory if the pregnancy is uneventful; and 4)
   GH-suppressive treatment can be safely withdrawn after conception in
   most acromegalic women. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 95: 4680-4687, 2010)}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) invokes
   evidence-based medicine (EBM) principles through the practice-based
   learning core competency. The authors hypothesized that among a
   representative sample of emergency medicine (EM) residency programs, a
   wide variability in EBM resident training priorities, faculty expertise
   expectations, and curricula exists.
   Objectives:
   The primary objective was to obtain descriptive data regarding EBM
   practices and expectations from EM physician educators. Our secondary
   objective was to assess differences in EBM educational priorities among
   journal club directors compared with non-journal club directors.
   Methods:
   A 19-question survey was developed by a group of recognized EBM
   curriculum innovators and then disseminated to Council of Emergency
   Medicine Residency Directors (CORD) conference participants, assessing
   their opinions regarding essential EBM skill sets and EBM curricular
   expectations for residents and faculty at their home institutions. The
   survey instrument also identified the degree of interest respondents had
   in receiving a free monthly EBM journal club curriculum.
   Results:
   A total of 157 individuals registered for the conference, and 98
   completed the survey. Seventy-seven (77\% of respondents) were either
   residency program directors or assistant/associate program directors.
   The majority of participants were from university-based programs and in
   practice at least 5 years. Respondents reported the ability to identify
   flawed research (45\%), apply research findings to patient care (43\%),
   and comprehend research methodology (33\%) as the most important
   resident skill sets. The majority of respondents reported no formal
   journal club or EBM curricula (75\%) and do not utilize structured
   critical appraisal instruments (71\%) when reviewing the literature.
   While journal club directors believed that resident learners' most
   important EBM skill is to identify secondary peer-reviewed resources,
   non-journal club directors identified residents' ability to distinguish
   significantly flawed research as the key skill to develop. Interest in
   receiving a free monthly EBM journal club curriculum was widely accepted
   (89\%).
   Conclusions:
   Attaining EBM proficiency is an expected outcome of graduate medical
   education (GME) training, although the specific domains of anticipated
   expertise differ between faculty and residents. Few respondents
   currently use a formalized curriculum to guide the development of EBM
   skill sets. There appears to be a high level of interest in obtaining
   EBM journal club educational content in a structured format. Measuring
   the effects of providing journal club curriculum content in conjunction
   with other EBM interventions may warrant further investigation.

Pages = {{696-703}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We describe a direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) model of Enceladus'
   neutral cloud and compare its results to observations of OH and O
   orbiting Saturn. The OH and O are observed far from Enceladus (at 3.95
   R-S), as far out as 25 R-S for O. Previous DSMC models attributed this
   breadth primarily to ion/neutral scattering (including charge exchange)
   and molecular dissociation. However, the newly reported O observations
   and a reinterpretation of the OH observations (Melin, H., Shemansky,
   D.E., Liu, X. {[}2009] Planet. Space Sci., 57, 1743-1753, PS\&S) showed
   that the cloud is broader than previously thought. We conclude that the
   addition of neutral/neutral scattering (Farmer, A.J. {[}2009] Icarus,
   202, 280-286), which was underestimated by previous models, brings the
   model results in line with the new observations. Neutral/neutral
   collisions primarily happen in the densest part of the cloud, near
   Enceladus' orbit, but contribute to the spreading by pumping up orbital
   eccentricity. Based on the cloud model presented here Enceladus maybe
   the ultimate source of oxygen for the upper atmospheres of Titan and
   Saturn. We also predict that large quantities of OH, O and H2O bombard
   Saturn's icy satellites. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Settlement area migration in England and Wales: assessing evidence for a
   social gradient}},
Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{571-584}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper uses a commissioned table based on data from the 2001 Census
   of Population to explore differentials in migration by ethnic group and
   occupational class. Employing an area classification based on the
   minority ethnic population and international and internal migration
   history of districts in England and Wales, it is hypothesised that those
   most likely to migrate from `immigrant settlement areas' are those with
   the greatest economic resources. It is suggested that if migration does
   vary by level of affluence, then a social gradient may be apparent with
   respect to migration propensity and occupational class membership.
   Furthermore, if such `affluent flight' can explain `racial' migration
   patterns, then a similar social gradient would be expected for each
   ethnic group, and a similar probability of migrating for people of
   common socio-demographic characteristics, irrespective of ethnic group.
   Three main questions relating to these themes were proposed, namely:
   Does a social gradient exist for the residential mobility of those who
   live in settlement areas of England and Wales? Is a social gradient
   associated with moves away from settlement areas and in particular
   towards other areas to which minorities have dispersed? Is the social
   gradient, such as it exists, similar for each ethnic group? Clear
   evidence is presented for a social gradient with respect to movement
   from settlement areas. It was found that for those who originated in
   settlement districts, the probability of moving was greater if in higher
   than lower occupational classes and this was consistent for all ethnic
   groups. In addition, migrants were more likely to move outside their own
   (settlement) district, and to a non-settlement district, if in
   professional forms of employment. Settlement areas in London were
   modelled separately, and London was shown to have a distinct pattern of
   migration. London professionals were less likely to move to a
   non-settlement district than those in less skilled employment.}},

Abstract = {{Species belonging to the Aerococcus genus are isolated from the urine
   and blood of elderly patients suffering from urinary tract infections
   (UTIs). However, the clinical significance, phenotypic features and
   antimicrobial susceptibilities of these underestimated and/or
   misidentified species remain unclear. From March 2006 to November 2008,
   among 350 non-enterococcal Streptococcaceae species isolated from
   urinary specimens, 30 (8.6\%) Aerococcus spp. strains were recovered.
   All strains were characterized using a phenotypic approach (API 20
   STREP, ID 32 STREP and VITEK 2 systems), 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and
   susceptibility to antimicrobial agents commonly used in UTIs. The
   average age of patients was 73 y and most of them presented with a
   predisposing urological disease (31\%) and/or a systemic underlying
   condition (48\%). All isolates were identified to the species level
   using the molecular tool (Aerococcus urinae, n = 20; Aerococcus
   sanguinicola, n = 8; Aerococcus viridans, n = 2), whereas the phenotypic
   methods were frequently unreliable. All aerococcal isolates were
   susceptible to amoxicillin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin and showed a
   low-level resistance to gentamicin. Fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole,
   and fosfomycin exhibited a variable activity. Most A. urinae isolates
   were resistant to co-trimoxazole and susceptible to fosfomycin, whereas
   all A. sanguinicola isolates were resistant to fosfomycin and
   susceptible to co-trimoxazole.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective To characterize the communication ritual in the
   pharmacist-customer dyad during a blood pressure measurement and
   counselling episode. Setting A Portuguese urban community pharmacy.
   Method An exploratory, cross-sectional design was used. Participants
   were purposively selected and data collected via audio recording, as
   well as demographics and clinical information via questionnaire.
   Encounters' verbal content was transcribed verbatim, utterances
   identified, time stamped, and classified according to a coding scheme of
   fifteen categories. All data was statistically analyzed using SPSSv17.
   Main outcome measures Four dialogue structures: speaker turn,
   interactivity, turn density and turn duration measurements. Results From
   a total of 51 participants, 72.5\% were female with a median age of 66
   years. The average systolic blood pressure was 140 mmHg, while the
   diastolic was 78 mmHg. The blood pressure measurement episode lasted for
   5:35 min, with an average of 81 utterances. From all utterances
   registered, 55.3\% were produced by the customer. Visits averaged 38
   speaker turns, with an interactivity rate of approximately 7 turns per
   episode minute. For pharmacists, turn duration averaged 7.0 s and turn
   density 2.1 utterances. The customers' turns comprised a mean of 8.0 s,
   with 2.4 utterances. Longer episodes were related to more speaker turns
   and greater customer turn density and duration, but lower dialogue
   interactivity. The interactivity rate was also lower when the customers'
   utterances increased. Pharmacists asked more questions (essentially
   closed ones), while the customers gave more information. No significant
   associations were observed between elderly/non-elderly and gender in
   relation to all communication variables. However, an increased number of
   speaker turns and closed-questions were associated to a higher systolic
   pressure. Conclusion It seems that pharmacists tend to control the
   content of the dialogue, while customers have more influence on the
   visit duration and interactivity. Specific hypertensive episodes induce
   a higher information search. Since the closed questioning format was
   prevalent, it seems that open information exchange was limited, mainly
   serving confirmation purposes rather than having a true exploratory
   nature. Although talk dominance is balanced, further analysis is
   required to better inform these results, which would confirm the low
   interactivity and the reduced information-seeking behaviour showed in
   the counselling episodes.}},

Abstract = {{Invasion of the flowering heads of grasses by Claviceps spp. can produce
   sclerotia (ergots) containing several toxins. Ingestion of these toxins,
   through the consumption of paspalum (Paspalum dilatatum), can induce a
   range of clinical symptoms, including staggers. Cattle are the most
   commonly affected species, but although sheep and horses have been
   reported affected there are no published descriptions of paspalum
   staggers in horses. We describe two occurrences of paspalum staggers,
   the first in three Australian Stockhorse foals and the second in mature
   Standardbred horses. All three foals presented with ataxia in all limbs
   after consuming infected paspalum. One foal died from misadventure and
   the other two recovered within 1 week of removal from the infected
   paddock. In the second case, two of eight mares and geldings grazing in
   an irrigation channel developed hindquarter paresis. After removal of
   all horses from the area, one of the affected horses continued to
   deteriorate. Both horses were treated with antibiotics. The more
   severely affected horse was also treated with fluids and electrolytes,
   but had to be euthanased. The second affected horse recovered after 2
   days. Paspalum pastures should inspected for Claviceps paspali infection
   before the introduction of horses.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Patients with scleroderma (systemic sclerosis; SSc) can be
   classified into subsets based on autoantibody profile and clinical
   features. Specificities such as anti-Th/To and anti-fibrillarin (U3RNP)
   are detectable mainly by immunoprecipitation (IP), which is not widely
   used in clinical laboratories. We examined the autoantibody profiles and
   clinical manifestations in a cohort of Italian patients with SSc,
   focusing on anti-Th/To and anticentromere (ACA) antibodies, associated
   with limited cutaneous SSc (IcSSc).
   Methods. Sera from 216 consecutive patients with SSc were tested for ACA
   (by indirect immunofluorescence), antitopoisomerase I (topo I; by
   counterimmunoelectrophoresis), and anti-RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII; by
   ELISA). Forty-one sera negative for these specificities were tested by
   IF analysis of proteins (S-35-methionine labeled K562 cell extract) and
   RNA (silver staining).
   Results. Among 216 SSc patients analyzed, anti-topo 1, ACA, and
   anti-RNAPIII were detected in 38\% (81/216), 31\% (67/216) and 7\%
   (15/16), respectively. Among 41 sera negative for ACA, anti-topo I, and
   anti-RNAPIII and which were tested by IP, 14 were nucleolar
   stain-positive. Eight out of 14 (57\%) showed anti-Thrro reactivity, but
   no anti-U3RNP was found. In comparison with ACA-positive patients,
   anti-Th/To-positive patients were younger (p = 0.0046) and more commonly
   were male (p = 0.0006). All 8 anti-Thrro-positive and all but one
   ACA-positive patients had IcSSc. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and
   pericarditis were more frequent in anti-Th/To-positive patients.
   Conclusion. Anti-Th/To are common in antinucleolar antibody-positive
   Italian patients with SSc. Anti-Th/To and ACA patients had IcSSc, with
   excellent prognosis. The anti-Th/To group had frequent pericarditis and
   ILD, although impairment of pulmonary function appeared mild. (First

Abstract = {{We report detailed rock-magnetic and paleomagnetic directional data from
   35 lava flows (302 standard paleomagnetic cores) sampled in the
   Central-Northern region of Uruguay in order to contribute to the study
   of the paleosecular variation of the Earth's magnetic field during early
   Cretaceous and to obtain precise Cretaceous paleomagnetic pole positions
   for stable South America. The average unit direction is rather precisely
   determined from 29 out of 35 sites. All A(95) confidence angles are less
   than 8A degrees, which points to small within-site dispersion and high
   directional stability. Normal polarity magnetizations are revealed for
   19 sites and 10 are reversely magnetized. Two other sites yield well
   defined intermediate polarities. The mean direction, supported by a
   positive reversal test is in reasonably good agreement with the expected
   paleodirection for Early Cretaceous stable South America and in
   disagreement with a 10A degrees clockwise rotation found in the previous
   studies. On the other hand, paleomagnetic poles are significantly
   different from the pole position suggested by hotspot reconstructions,
   which may be due to true polar wander or the hotspot motion. Our data
   suggest a different style of secular variation during (and just before)
   the Cretaceous Normal Superchron and the last 5 Ma, supporting a link
   between paleosecular variation and reversal frequency.}},

Abstract = {{Tuberculin skin test (TST) has been used effectively for a long time,
   despite inherent sensitivity and specificity limitations. Patients with
   a positive TST without active tuberculosis are identified as having
   latent tuberculosis infection. Identifying patients with latent
   tuberculosis infection with this test is an important part of control of
   the disease. A whole-blood inferferon gamma (IFN-gamma) assay, the
   Quantiferon TB Gold test (QTG; Cellestis, Australia) which is a
   promising in vitro diagnostic test for the identification of latent
   tuberculosis infection (LTBI), has potential advantages over the TST.
   This test includes Myobacterium tuberculosis specific ESAT- 6 and CFP-10
   antigens. The aim of this study was to compare the results obtained by
   QTG and TST in active tuberculosis (TB) patients, close contacts of
   patients, health care workers and tuberculosis laboratory personel.
   Twenty-six patients with active pulmonary TB, 6 close contacts of those
   patients, 11 health care workers with contact to TB patients and 8 TB
   reference laboratory personnel were included in the study. Prior to
   administration of the TST, blood samples were drawn from each
   participant for QTG test. All subjects were asked for BCG vaccination
   history and examined for a BCG scar. All individuals had a BCG scar. The
   QTG assay was performed in whole blood samples according to
   manufacturer's instructions. The agreement between TST and QTG was
   measured with kappa statistical analysis. In active TB patients
   (true-infected cases) TST (PPD) positivity was found 34.6\% (9/26) while
   QTG positivity was 65.3\% (17/26). Although the positivity rate was
   higher in QTG test, this difference was not found statistically
   significant (p> 0.001). TST and QTG positivity rates for health care
   workers, close house contact of TB patients and TB laboratory staff were
   as follows, respectively; 36\% (4/11) and 27\% (3/11); 16.6\% (1/6) and
   83\% (5/6); 37.5\% (3/8) and 75\% (6/8). The mean PPD diameter was 11 mm
   in QTG negative group and 14 mm in QTG positive group with a
   statistically significant difference (p< 0.001). However, there was no
   statistical significance between QTG positive and negative groups by
   means of age (P >= 0.05) and gender (p< 0.001). In conclusion, QTG assay
   was superior to TST in its ability to detect LTBI and active TB
   infection, not to be affected with BCG vaccination, to discriminate
   responses due to non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and to avoid variability
   and subjectivity associated with application and reading the TST.
   Besides, QTG assay needs only one visit to the test unit. However, its
   being expensive than TST and requirement for special equipments and
   skilled laboratory personnel, are among the disadvantages of QTG assay.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the fire scheduling problem (FSP) for field
   artillery, which is the problem of scheduling operations of firing at
   given targets with a given set of weapons. We consider a situation in
   which the number of available weapons is smaller than the number of
   targets, the targets are assigned to the weapons already, and targets
   may move and hence the probability that a target is destroyed by a
   firing attack decreases as time passes. We present a branch and bound
   algorithm for the FSP with the objective of minimizing total threat of
   the targets, which is expressed as a function of the destruction
   probabilities of the targets. Results of computational tests show that
   the suggested algorithm solves problems of a medium size in a reasonable
   amount of computation time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new multi-source image fusion scheme based on
   lifting stationary wavelet transform (LSWT) and a novel dual-channel
   pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN). By using LSWT, we can calculate a
   flexible multiscale and shift-invariant representation of registered
   images. After decomposing the original images using LSWT, a new
   dual-channel pulse coupled neural network, which can overcome some
   shortcomings of original PCNN for image fusion and putout the fusion
   image directly, is proposed and used for the fusion of sub-band
   coefficients of LSWT. In this fusion scheme, a new
   sum-modified-laplacian(NSML) of the low frequency sub-band image, which
   represent the edge-feature of the low frequency sub-band image in SLWT
   domain, is presented and input to motivate the dual-channel PCNN. For
   the fusion of high frequency sub-band coefficients, a novel local
   neighborhood modified-laplacian (LNML) measurement is developed and used
   as external stimulus to motivate the dual-channel PCNN. This fusion
   scheme is verified on several sets of multi-source images, and the
   experiments show that the algorithms proposed in the paper can
   significantly improve image fusion performance, compared with the fusion
   algorithms such as traditional wavelet, LSWT, and LSWT-PCNN in terms of
   objective criteria and visual appearance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We introduce a hybrid photonic surface plasmon ring resonator which
   consists of a silicon nitride (Si3N4) dielectric traveling-wave ring
   resonator vertically coupled to a thin layer of metallic strip ring
   resonator made of Silver (Ag) on top. The cladding is assumed to be
   porous alumina on top of the metal layer, which provides more surface
   area for the adsorption of target molecules and their efficient
   interaction with the surface plasmon wave excited at the metal-cladding
   interface. Simulations show that this hybrid structure has a large
   refractive index sensitivity due to the excitation of surface plasmon
   waves and also a relatively narrow resonance linewidth due to the large
   quality factor of the photonic ring resonator. The Finite Element method
   is used to systematically design the hybrid structure and to investigate
   the performance of the hybrid resonator as a refractive index sensor.
   The proposed structure is very compact and can be implemented on a chip
   in an integrated platform. Thus, it can be used for lab-on-a-chip
   sensing applications and is capable of being spectrally and spatially
   multiplexed for muti-analyte sensing.}},

Abstract = {{In the traditional metal forming product development paradigm, product
   design is generally based on heuristic know-how and experience, which
   are basically acquired through many years of practice. This kind of
   product design paradigm is of more trial-and-error than in-depth
   scientific calculation and analysis. Product defect prediction and
   quality assurance is, thus, a nontrivial issue in this product
   development paradigm. With the aid of finite element (FE) simulation,
   deformation-related defects can be predicted and analyzed. In this
   paper, flow-induced folding defect in forging of axially symmetrical
   flanged components is systematically investigated. A FE model to study
   the root-cause of the defect based on the material flow behavior is
   developed and a defect formation mechanism is revealed. The variation of
   material flow behavior with the changes of part geometry parameters is
   investigated extensively. Based on the simulation results, the parameter
   variation characteristics and the sensitivity of each parameter to
   folding defect avoidance are identified. Using industrial components as
   case studies, the efficiency of the proposed defect avoidance approach
   is verified. The approach is further proven to be able to provide
   practical guidelines for the design of defect-free axially symmetrical
   flanged components. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4002188]}},

Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of
   Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity on health-related quality of
   life (QOL) during the first year of follow-up.
   Methods: TheWorld Health Organization Quality of Life - Brief
   (WHOQOL-BREF) was administered 1 month before operation, and at 1, 3, 6
   and 12 months after surgery. Body mass index, co-morbidities and
   operation-related complications were measured at these times. A
   mixed-effect model was constructed to analyse repeated measurements and
   determine the relationships between body mass index, WHOQOL-BREF scores
   and other variables.
   Results: A total of 102 patients were enrolled. The mixed-effect model
   showed that the physical, psychological and social domains improved
   after bariatric surgery, with simultaneous reduction in weight and
   improvement in co-morbidities. There was a dip in scores in physical and
   psychological domains 3-6 months after surgery, significantly related to
   complications. All patients gradually improved between 6 and 12 months
   after surgery, reaching levels similar to those of healthy subjects.
   Conclusion: Health-related QOL improved dramatically after bariatric
   surgery, dipped slightly between 3 and 6 months, and improved again up
   to the end of the first year.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the alternative conceptions
   about burning phenomena among Atayal indigene elementary school students
   in Taiwan. The main difference from other relevant research is that this
   study assesses Atayal people's worldview by means of a questionnaire
   developed specifically for this purpose. There were three stages in this
   study: First, three Atayal elders were interviewed to access their
   traditional knowledge about nature, naturally occurring events, and
   burning. Second, this knowledge was used to develop an open-ended
   questionnaire that was administered to 37 students at the third to sixth
   grade levels (ages 9 to 12); eight respondents were interviewed to
   document their worldviews. Third, a two-tier diagnostic questionnaire
   developed from these results was administered to 228 students with 44
   respondents interviewed about the burning events assessed by the
   instrument. Results suggested that students held alternative conceptions
   about the five burning events: candles burning, factors of burning, fire
   extinguishment, material changes in burning, and traditional meanings of
   burning. In contrast with previous studies on burning, this study
   demonstrated the existence of other alternative conceptions. The origin
   of these alternative conceptions may be grounded in traditional culture,
   knowledge, environment, economy, medicine, and personal thinking.}},

Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies in ovine uterine arteries have demonstrated that sex
   steroid hormones upregulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
   expression and downregulate the protein kinase C signaling pathway,
   resulting in the attenuated myogenic tone in pregnancy. The present
   study tested the hypothesis that chronic hypoxia during gestation
   inhibits the sex steroid-mediated adaptation of extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and protein kinase C signaling pathways and
   increases the myogenic tone of uterine arteries. Uterine arteries were
   isolated from nonpregnant and near-term pregnant sheep that had been
   maintained at sea level (approximate to 300 m) or exposed to
   high-altitude (3801 m) hypoxia for 110 days. In contrast to the previous
   findings in normoxic animals, 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone failed
   to suppress protein kinase C-induced contractions and the
   pressure-induced myogenic tone in uterine arteries from hypoxic animals.
   Western analyses showed that the sex steroids lost their effects on
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 expression and
   phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 levels, as well as the
   activation of protein kinase C isozymes in uterine arteries of hypoxic
   ewes. In normoxic animals, pregnancy and the sex steroid treatments
   significantly increased uterine artery estrogen receptor-alpha and
   progesterone receptor B expression. Chronic hypoxia selectively
   downregulated estrogen receptor-alpha expression in uterine arteries of
   pregnant animals and eliminated the upregulation of estrogen
   receptor-alpha in pregnancy or by the steroid treatments observed in
   normoxic animals. The results demonstrate that, in the ovine uterine
   artery, chronic hypoxia in pregnancy inhibits the sex steroid
   hormone-mediated adaptation of decreased myogenic tone by downregulating
   estrogen receptor-alpha expression, providing a mechanism linking
   hypoxia and maladaptation of uteroplacental circulation and an increased
   risk of preeclampsia in pregnancy. (Hypertension. 2010;56:750-757.)}},

Abstract = {{To address the worsening problems of global warming and the urban heat
   island effect, ecological cities and building environment greening are
   being promoted in population-dense urban areas domestically and abroad.
   For example, the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport,
   and Tourism announced the CASBEE-HI (Heat Island) assessment system in
   2008 as a response to worsening urban warming and urban heat island
   effects. The Ministry implemented ``Building Space Greening Plans{''} in
   Tokyo, Osaka, and other cities, enforcing by law the effective reduction
   of urban temperatures and improving urban living environments and
   alleviating the threat of urban ecological disasters. Therefore, this
   study integrates Taiwan domestic and foreign building space greening
   design, derived greening benefits, implementation promotion methods, and
   greening design policies as measurement constructs to examine the mutual
   influence between different constructs and to analyze the degree of
   influence on the urban real estate market.
   From the result, demonstrating that building space environment greening
   design does bring about positive benefits. In addition, the greening
   benefit was shown to have a positive impact on the urban real estate
   market. At the same time, greening promotion implementation method and
   urban policy standard both had a positive impact on the urban real
   estate market, demonstrating that government promotion of building
   environment greening design through urban design policy means is
   acceptable to the public. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The premotor cortex (PMC) plays an important role in selecting and

   PMC lesions (PMCLesion) and seven PMC spared (PMCSpared)) and eight age-
   and sex-matched healthy adults participated in the study The subjects
   performed rapid forward stepping with the right or left leg under simple
   and choice reaction time conditions The percentage of trials in which
   the subject showed the correct initial vertical ground reaction force
   pattern before lift-off of the stepping leg indicated the accuracy in
   selecting the designated stepping leg The latency of bilateral
   contractions in the tibialis anterior (TA) and the reaction time (RT) of
   the stepping leg represented the time needed to prepare for
   stepping-related APAs and stepping movement respectively All three
   groups demonstrated a similar rate of accuracy of the stepping leg
   selection under both conditions However in both conditions the PMCLesion
   group exhibited a longer RT and TA contraction latency of the affected
   leg than the healthy and PMCSpared groups The PMCLesion group also
   presented a longer TA contraction latency of the unaffected leg than the
   healthy group in both conditions These results suggest that the PMC is
   involved in APAs associated with leg stepping movement and that a PMC
   lesion in one hemisphere impairs APAs of both the contralateral and
   ipsilateral legs during stepping (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights

Abstract = {{An investigation is carried out on the systematic analysis of the
   dynamic behavior of the hybrid squeeze-film damper (HSFD) mounted a
   gear-bearing system with strongly non-linear oil-film force and gear
   meshing force in the present study. The dynamic orbits of the system are
   observed using bifurcation diagrams plotted using the dimensionless
   unbalance coefficient, damping coefficient and the dimensionless
   rotating speed ratio as control parameters. The non-dimensional
   equations of the gear-bearing system are solved using the fourth order
   Runge-Kutta method. The onset of chaotic motion is identified from the
   phase diagrams, power spectra, Poincar, maps, bifurcation diagrams,
   maximum Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimension of the gear-bearing
   system. The results presented in this study provide some useful insights
   into the design and development of a gear-bearing system for rotating

Abstract = {{This study investigated autochthonous yeasts and their functions in the
   spontaneous fermentation of freshly crushed pineapple juice samples
   collected from two different areas of both Thailand and Australia.
   Hanseniaspora uvarum and Pichia guilliermondii were the main yeast
   species observed on the fruit skins of Thai samples, and also in the
   fresh juice and ferments of all samples from both countries. P.
   guilliermondii was consistently present as the dominant species during
   the early stage of the fermentation, whereas H. uvarum became more
   prevalent towards the end of the six-day fermentation period, with
   populations increasing from an initial level of similar to 5 log CFU/mL
   to similar to 8 log CFU/mL at the end of fermentation. The ethanol
   levels in samples from both regions of Thailand were maximal at 2 days
   of fermentation, reaching similar to 1 to 2\% (v/v) but then declined
   thereafter. In contrast, in the Australian samples ethanol levels
   continued to increase over the entire six-day fermentation period and
   reached similar to 3 to 4\% (v/v). A significant decrease in citric acid
   and increase in lactic acid levels were observed throughout the
   fermentation period in the samples from Thailand, but not in those from
   Australia where the different acid contents (and pH) were relatively
   stable. The other wine yeasts and, in particular, Saccharomyces yeasts,
   were not found in any of sampled fermentation systems that is apparently
   different from the other fruit juices. These findings suggested that the
   freshly crushed pineapple juice may possibly have some effects on the
   other autochthonous yeasts having important role in alcoholic
   fermentation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Subsurface drainage systems are used to control the depth of the water
   table and to reduce or prevent soil salinity. Generally, the flow of the
   groundwater is studied with the Bousssinesq equation, whose analytical
   solutions are obtained assuming that aquifer transmissivity and
   drainable porosity are constant. These solutions assume as well that the
   free surface of the water falls instantly over the drains. The general
   solution requires numerical methods. Some authors have demonstrated that
   the drain boundary condition is a fractal radiation condition and that
   the drainable porosity is a variable which is related to the soil
   retention curve. This solution has been obtained with a finite element
   method, which in one-dimensional form is equivalent to a finite
   difference method. Here, we propose a finite difference solution of the
   differential equation with variable drainable porosity and a fractal
   radiation condition. The proposed finite differences method has two
   formulations: the first one, with an explicit head and drainable
   porosity, both joined with a functional relationship, which we call
   mixed formulation; and the second one, which we call head formulation,
   with only the head. Both methods have been validated with a lineal
   analytical solution, and the nonlinear part is stable and brief The
   proposed numerical solution is useful for the hydraulic characterization
   of soils with inverse modeling and for improving the design of
   agricultural drainage systems, considering that the assumptions of the
   classical solution have been eliminated.}},

Abstract = {{A previous assessment of radiocarbon ((14)C) dates from alluvial units
   in southeastern Australia revealed a gap in the geochronological record
   that coincides with the Holocene climatic optimum. This gap in the
   alluvial record can be further refined using optically stimulated
   luminescence (OSL). The chronology of Holocene river terraces on Widden
   Brook, a sandy alluvial stream in southeastern Australia, was
   established using (14)C and OSL techniques. Combined use of these
   independent techniques allows for a more rigorous assessment of the
   alluvial record. The robust chronology, consisting of 38 (14)C and 11
   OSL samples, permitted identification of significant depositional
   variation within the catchment, resulting from localised geomorphic
   processes. The three terrace sequences identified yielded distinct
   chronologies, suggesting alluvial deposition at different times. The
   sequences exhibited a continuous chronology, which indicated continuous
   deposition throughout the Holocene. The chronology of terrace sequences
   within this catchment suggests that terrace formation can be attributed
   to localised geomorphic processes rather than climatic forcing.

Abstract = {{This article traces the pathways of constitutional development in five
   major Asian nations-India, China, Korea, Japan, and Indonesia. It
   considers whether constitutionalism in its Western form may be regarded
   as having universal appeal and application far beyond the Western
   nations in which it originated, and whether it may be argued that there
   exists a distinctly Asian form of constitutionalism or of
   political-constitutional practices. Adopting a macrohistorical and
   comparative perspective on developments in these five nations, from the
   late nineteenth century up to the present, the article demonstrates that
   constitutionalism has significantly broadened and deepened its reach in
   Asia in modern and contemporary times. It also suggests that no
   distinctly Asian mode of constitutionalism or of
   political-constitutional practices can be identified. Nor is there
   evidence that Asian culture and values are particularly resistant to
   constitutionalism. On the contrary, there is evidence that whether
   constitutionalism eventually triumphs in a particular jurisdiction is
   determined more by politics and the contingency of historical events,
   such as wars and foreign interventions, than by culture and values.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless structural health monitoring research has drawn great attention
   in recent years from various research groups. While sensor network
   approach is a feasible solution for structural health monitoring, the
   design of wireless sensor networks presents a number of challenges, such
   as adaptability and the limited communication bandwidth. To address
   these challenges, we explore the mobile agent approach to enhance the
   flexibility and reduce raw data transmission in wireless structural
   health monitoring sensor networks. An integrated wireless sensor network
   consisting of a mobile agent-based network middleware and distributed
   high computational power sensor nodes is developed. These embedded
   computer-based high computational power sensor nodes include Linux
   operating system, integrate with open source numerical libraries, and
   connect to multimodality sensors to support both active and passive
   sensing. The mobile agent middleware is built on a mobile agent system
   called Mobile-C. The mobile agent middleware allows a sensor network
   moving computational programs to the data source. With mobile agent
   middleware, a sensor network is able to adopt newly developed diagnosis
   algorithms and make adjustment in response to operational or task
   changes. The presented mobile agent approach has been validated for
   structural damage diagnosis using a scaled steel bridge.}},

   Shilnikov-type homoclinic orbits and chaotic dynamics of the averaged
   equations are studied in detail. The global bifurcation analysis
   indicates that there exist the heteroclinic bifurcations and the
   Shilnikov-type homoclinic orbits in the averaged equations. The results
   obtained above mean the existence of the amplitude-modulated chaos for
   the Smale horseshoe sense in the externally excited system with
   autoparametric resonance. Furthermore, a detailed bifurcation analysis
   of the dynamic (periodic and chaotic) solutions of the averaged
   equations is presented. Nine branches of dynamic solutions are found.
   Two of these branches emerge from two Hopf bifurcations and the other
   seven are isolated. The limit cycles undergo symmetry-breaking,
   cyclic-fold and period-doubling bifurcations. whereas the chaotic
   attractors undergo attractor-merging and boundary crises. Simultaneous
   occurrence of the limit cycle and chaotic attractors, homoclinic orbits,
   intermittency chaos and homoclinic explosions are also observed. (C)

Abstract = {{A state-of-the-science thermodynamic model describing gas-particle
   absorption processes was used to predict the gas-particle partitioning
   of mixtures of approximately 60 carbonyl compounds emitted from
   low-emission gasoline-powered vehicles, three-way catalyst
   gasoline-powered vehicles, heavy-duty diesel vehicles under the
   idle-creep condition (HDDV idle), and heavy-duty diesel vehicles under
   the five-mode test (HDDV 5-mode). Exhaust was diluted by a factor of
   120-580 with a residence time of approximately 43 sec. The predicted
   equilibrium absorption partitioning coefficients differed from the
   measured partitioning coefficients by several orders of magnitude. Time
   scales to reach equilibrium in the dilution sampling system were close
   to the actual residence time during the HDDV 5-mode test and much longer
   than the actual residence time during the other vehicle tests. It
   appears that insufficient residence time in the sampling system cannot
   uniformly explain the failure of the absorption mechanism to explain the
   measured partitioning. Other gas-particle partitioning mechanisms (e.g.,
   heterogeneous reactions, capillary adsorption) beyond the simple
   absorption theory are needed to explain the discrepancy between
   calculated carbonyl partitioning coefficients and observed partitioning.
   Both of these alternative partitioning mechanisms imply great challenges
   for the measurement and modeling of semi-volatile primary organic
   aerosol (POA) species from motor vehicles. Furthermore, as emitted
   particle concentrations from newer vehicles approach atmospheric
   background levels, dilution sampling systems must fundamentally change
   their approach so that they use realistic particle concentrations in the
   dilution air to approximately represent real-world conditions. Samples
   collected with particle-free dilution air yielding total particulate
   matter concentrations below typical ambient concentrations will not
   provide a realistic picture of partitioning for semi-volatile compounds.}},

Title = {{Occurrence and Persistence of Erythromycin Resistance Genes (erm) and

Abstract = {{Animal manure from modern animal agriculture constitutes the single
   largest source of antibiotic resistance (AR) owing to the use of large
   quantities of antibiotics. After animal manure enters the environment,
   the AR disseminates into the environment and can pose a potentially
   serious threat to the health and well-being of both humans and animals.
   In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of three different on-farm
   waste treatment systems in reducing AR. Three classes of erythromycin
   resistance genes (erm) genes (B, F, and X) conferring resistances to
   macrolide-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLSB) and one class of
   tetracycline resistance genes (tet) gene (G) conferring resistance to
   tetracyclines were used as models. Real-time polymerase chain reaction
   assays were used to determine the reservoir sizes of these AR genes
   present in the entire microbiome. These classes of AR genes varied
   considerably in abundance, with erm(B) being more predominant than
   erm(F), erm(X), and tet(G). These AR genes also varied in persistence in
   different waste treatment systems. Aerobic biofiltration reduced erm(X)
   more effectively than other AR genes, while mesophilic anaerobic
   digestion and lagoon storage did not appreciably reduce any of these AR
   genes. Unlike chemical pollutants, some AR genes could increase after
   reduction in a preceding stage of the treatment processes. Season might
   also affect the persistence of AR. These results indicate that AR
   arising from swine-feeding operations can survive typical swine waste
   treatment processes and thus treatments that are more effective in
   destructing AR on farms are required.}},

   a 41\% enhancement at 20-mA operating current, compared to standard

Abstract = {{The free-energy landscape of glycerol permeation through the
   aquaglyceroporin GlpF has been estimated in the literature by the
   nonequilibrium method of steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations
   and by the equilibrium method of adaptive biasing force (ABF)
   simulations. However, the ABF results qualitatively disagree with the
   SMD results that were based on the Jarzynski equality (JE) relating the
   equilibrium free-energy difference to the nonequilibrium work of the
   irreversible pulling experiments. In this paper. I present a new SMD
   study of the glycerol permeation through GlpF to explore the free-energy
   profile of glycerol along the permeation channel. Instead of the JE in
   terms of thermodynamic work, I use the fluctuation-dissipation theorem
   (FDT) of Brownian dynamics (BD), in terms of mechanical work, for
   extracting the free-energy difference from the nonequilibrium work of
   irreversible pulling experiments. The results of this new SMD-BD-FDT
   study are in agreement with the experimental data and with the ABF
   results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies of dynamic crossmodal integration have revealed that
   the direction of apparent motion in a target modality can be influenced
   by a spatially incongruent motion stream in another, distractor
   modality. Yet, it remains to be examined whether non-motion intra- and
   crossmodal perceptual grouping can affect apparent motion in a given
   target modality. To address this question, we employed Ternus
   apparent-motion displays, which consist of three horizontal aligned
   visual (or tactile) stimuli that can alternately be seen as either
   `element motion' or `group motion'. We manipulated intra- and crossmodal
   grouping by cueing the middle stimulus with different cue-target onset
   asynchronies (CTOAs). In unimodal conditions, we found Ternus apparent
   motion to be readily biased towards `element motion' by precues with
   short or intermediate CTOAs in the visual modality and by precues with
   short CTOAs in the tactile modality. By contrast, crossmodal precues
   with short or intermediate CTOAs had no influence on Ternus apparent
   motion. However, crossmodal synchronous tactile cues led to dominant
   `group motion' percepts. And for unimodal visual apparent motion,
   precues with long CTOAs shifted apparent motion towards `group motion'
   in general. The results suggest that intra- and crossmodal interactions
   on visual and tactile apparent motion take place in different temporal
   ranges, but both are subject to attentional modulations at long CTOAs.

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to identify the causes of prolonged facial
   edema and its associations with other clinical factors.
   Facial edema sometimes is observed in patients with head and neck
   squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but its prevalence and association with
   other factors is unclear.
   Between July 2003 and July 2007, the medical records from 264 patients
   with HNSCC were reviewed. Prolonged facial edema is defined as
   persistence of edematous status (largest thickness > 5 mm by CT scan)
   for more than 100 days. Clinical data including age, gender, tumor
   stage, and tumor primary sites were recorded. Statistical analyses were
   performed to determine the prognostic effect of prolonged facial edema,
   as well as its relationship to other clinical variables. The etiology of
   prolonged facial edema was also analyzed.
   Prolonged facial edema occurred in 32 (12.1\%) patients. The etiologies
   included internal jugular vein thrombosis, local infection, neck lymph
   nodes dissection, flap reconstruction, and direct vessel compression by
   tumors or metastatic lymph nodes. There was no significant difference in
   the incidence of prolonged facial edema in patients receiving different
   treatment modalities; however, patients receiving neck dissection
   correlated with the occurrence of late-onset facial edema. In addition
   to previously demonstrated prognostic factors (T status, nodal
   involvement and distant metastasis), prolonged facial edema was also
   identified as independent prognostic indicators for HNSCC patients (P =
   0.001).
   Prolonged facial edema may reflect the underlying disease status, and it
   can be applied as a prognostic marker in patients with HNSCC.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a robust control scheme is proposed for a class of

   scheme is presented based on the designed sliding mode observer. The
   developed observer-based control scheme consists of two parts. One term
   is a linear controller and the other term is a neural network
   controller. Using the Lyapunov method, a criterion for bounded stability
   of the closed-loop system is developed in terms of linear matrix
   inequalities. Finally, a simulation example is used to illustrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed robust control scheme.}},

   isotropic and magneto-electro-elastic with its axis of symmetry normal

   Green's functions to point sources applied on the surface, explicit
   expressions for the generalized pressure vs. indentation depth are
   derived for the first time for the three common indenters (flat-ended,
   conical, and spherical punches). The important multiphase coupling issue
   is discussed in detail, with the weak and strong coupling being
   correctly revisited. The derived analytical solutions of indentation
   will not only serve as benchmarks for future numerical studies of
   multiphase composites, but also have important applications to
   experimental test and characterization of multiphase materials, in
   particular, of multiferroic properties. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{678-685}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the effect of micro-cracks induced by a slow
   heating/cooling process (also called heat-treatment) in a mortar, upon
   its poro-elastic properties under drained hydrostatic compression, and
   upon its intrinsic permeability. Prior to the experiments, mortar
   samples are subjected to a slow heating-cooling cycle up to one
   temperature T = 105, 200, 300 and 400 degrees C. The reference state of
   mortar is taken after drying at 60 degrees C until constant mass.
   Experimental results show that the effective drained bulk modulus K-b of
   mortar decreases significantly with heat-treatment temperature T. A
   transition from elastic to plastic behavior with increasing
   heat-treatment temperature T is also observed. These effects are mainly
   attributed to heating-induced micro-cracks, and, to a lesser extent, to
   the increase in connected porosity. We also measure a significant
   increase in permeability.
   Based on these experimental evidences, a micro-mechanical analysis is
   proposed, which describes micro-cracks as independent 3D penny-shaped
   cracks of varying aspect ratio alpha. A relationship between the
   degradation of bulk modulus and heating-induced micro-cracks is
   established. The distribution of aspect ratio of micro-crack porosity is
   determined for each heat-treatment temperature. The con-elation between
   heating-induced crack porosity (or with crack aspect ratio) and
   permeability is also determined. Finally, a phenomenological law is
   proposed to describe the increase in plastic deformation with T. Good
   correlation with experimental stress-strain curves is found. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Behavioral research and prevention intervention science efforts have
   largely been based on hypotheses of linear or rational behavior change.
   Additional advances in the field may result from the integration of
   quantum behavior change and catastrophe models. Longitudinal data from a
   randomized trial for 1241 pre-adolescents 9-12 years old who
   self-described as virgin were analyzed. Data for 469 virgins in the
   control group were included for linear and cusp catastrophe models to
   describe sexual initiation: data for the rest in the intervention group
   were added for program effect assessment. Self-reported likelihood to
   have sex was positively associated with actual initiation of sex (OR =
   1.72, 95\% CI: 1.43-2.06, R-2 = 0.13). Receipt of a behavioral
   prevention intervention based on a cognitive model prevented 15.6\%
   (33.0\% vs. 48.6\%, OR = 0.52, 95\% CI: 0.24-1.11) of the participants
   from initiating sex among only those who reported ``very likely to have
   sex.{''} The beta coefficients for the cubic term of the cusp assessing
   three bifurcating variables (planning to have sex, intrinsic rewards
   from sex and self:efficacy for abstinence) were 0.0726, 0.1116 and
   0.1069 respectively; R-2 varied from 0.49 to 0.54 (p<0.001 for all).
   Although an intervention based on a model of continuous behavior change
   did produce a modest impact on sexual initiation, quantum change has
   contributed more than continuous change in describing sexual initiation
   among young adolescents, suggesting the need for quantum change and
   chaotic models to advance behavioral prevention of HIV/AIDS.}},

Abstract = {{We theoretically verify that converting the Hermite-Gaussian modes into
   the Laguerre-Gaussian can lead to the spatial morphologies of the
   two-dimensional (2D) coherent states to be transformed from Lissajous

   we experimentally generate various structured light beams by exploiting
   a cylindrical-lens mode converter to transform the optical Lissajous

Abstract = {{Cardiac syndrome X (CSX) is defined as a typical anginal-like chest pain
   with a transient ischemic electrocardiogram, but without abnormal
   coronary angiography. It is usually accepted that endothelial
   dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress and estrogen deficiency are
   the main reasons of CSX. There are some methods to treat CSX including
   statins, beta blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,
   nitrates, estrogen, and so on. The estrogen replacement therapy (ERT),
   in particular, has been reported by many researchers to significantly
   reduce the frequency of chest pain after administration of estrogen,
   which has been explained as estrogen acting on its receptor to improve
   the endothelial function. However, it has been suggested that ERT must
   not be used for coronary heart disease due to its adverse effects.
   However, some selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) can inhibit
   inflammatory response as well as oxidative stress, and improve the
   endothelial function, to reduce the occurrence of chest pain. Here, we
   hypothesize that SERMs may be the beneficial selection for patients with
   CSX.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the dual boundary integral equation formulation
   in plane elasticity using a complex variable. Four kinds of BIE are
   studied, and they are: (1) the first complex variable BIE for the
   interior region, (2) the second complex variable BIE for the interior
   region, (3) the first complex variable BIE for the exterior region, and
   (4) the second complex variable BIE for the exterior region. Using the
   Somigliana identity and letting the domain point approach a boundary
   point, the first complex variable BIE is obtained. Displacement versus
   traction operator is suggested. Using this operator and letting the
   domain point approach a boundary point, the second complex variable BIE
   is obtained. When the domain point approaches a boundary point, all
   limit processes are performed exactly through the generalized
   Sokhotski-Plemelys formulae. For the exterior problems, two degenerate
   boundary cases, the curved crack and the deformable curved line, are
   studied. Particularly, for the degenerate boundary case, or the
   shrinking curved crack case, four kinds of BIE are obtained. (C) 2010

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral targeting (BT) leverages historical user behavior to select
   the ads most relevant to users to display. The state-of-the-art of BT
   derives a linear Poisson regression model from fine-grained user
   behavioral data and predicts click-through rate (CTR) from user history.
   We designed and implemented a highly scalable and efficient solution to
   BT using Hadoop MapReduce framework. With our parallel algorithm and the
   resulting system, we can build above 450 BT-category models from the
   entire Yahoo's user base within one day, the scale that one can not even
   imagine with prior systems. Moreover, our approach has yielded 20\% CTR
   lift over the existing production system by leveraging the well-grounded
   probabilistic model fitted from a much larger training dataset.
   Specifically, our major contributions include: (1) A MapReduce
   statistical learning algorithm and implementation that achieve optimal
   data parallelism, task parallelism, and load balance in spite of the
   typically skewed distribution of domain data. (2) An in-place feature
   vector generation algorithm with strict linear-time complexity O(n)
   regardless of the granularity of sliding target window. (3) An in-memory
   caching scheme that significantly reduces the number of disk IOs to make
   large-scale learning practical. (4) Highly efficient data structures and
   sparse representations of models and data to enable fast model updates.
   We believe that our work makes significant contributions to solving
   large-scale machine learning problems of industrial relevance in
   general. Finally, we report comprehensive experimental results, using
   industrial proprietary codebase and datasets.}},

Journal = {{MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{The Lucas-Kanade tracker (LKT) is a commonly used method to track target
   objects over 2D images. The key principle behind the object tracking of
   an LKT is to warp the object appearance so as to minimize the difference
   between the warped object's appearance and a pre-stored template.
   Accordingly, the 2D pose of the tracked object in terms of translation,
   rotation, and scaling can be recovered from the warping. To extend the
   LKT for 3D pose estimation, a model-based 3D LKT assumes a 3D geometric
   model for the target object in the 3D space and tries to infer the 3D
   object motion by minimizing the difference between the projected 2D
   image of the 3D object and the pre-stored 2D image template. In this
   paper, we propose an extended model-based 3D LKT for estimating 3D head
   poses by tracking human heads on video sequences. In contrast to the
   original model-based 3D LKT, which uses a template with each pixel
   represented by a single intensity value, the proposed model-based 3D LKT
   exploits an adaptive template with each template pixel modeled by a
   continuously updated Gaussian distribution during head tracking. This
   probabilistic template modeling improves the tracker's ability to handle
   temporal fluctuation of pixels caused by continuous environmental
   changes such as varying illumination and dynamic backgrounds. Due to the
   new probabilistic template modeling, we reformulate the head pose
   estimation as a maximum likelihood estimation problem, rather than the
   original difference minimization procedure. Based on the new
   formulation, an algorithm to estimate the best head pose is derived. The
   experimental results show that the proposed extended model-based 3D LKT
   achieves higher accuracy and reliability than the conventional one does.
   Particularly, the proposed LKT is very effective in handling varying
   illumination, which cannot be well handled in the original LKT.}},

Abstract = {{An output regulation problem can be converted into a stabilization
   problem in a systematic framework, thanks to an appropriately designed
   internal model. However, the successful construction of an internal
   model (IM) relies on the observability condition of a steady-state
   generator (SSG). In the literature, the observability condition is
   restricted to linear or linearized SSGs. This paper introduces a novel
   observability condition for nonlinear SSGs. Nonlinear observability
   leads to an effective combination of the internal model principle and
   the certainty equivalence principle for a more general class of systems.

Title = {{Quality assurance evidence collection model for MSN forensics}},

Abstract = {{Instant Messaging (IM) applications have become an important tool for
   business and social communication. However, when using IM, individuals
   and companies expose themselves to many security threats. Collecting all
   available data and preserving the integrity of evidence is a challenging
   task to perform IM forensics. In particular, under resource constrained
   situations, a good evidence collection mechanism is required to provide
   effective event collection in a network environment with heavy traffic.
   The emphasis of this paper is on the development of an effective
   evidence collection control mechanism that achieves an optimal outcome
   with a reasonable forensic service requests acceptance ratio and
   tolerable level of data capture loss. In this paper, we propose an
   evidence collection control model used in network forensics, called
   Quality Assurance Evidence Collection (QAEC). QAEC dynamically adjusts
   the amount of data to be collected on an evidence flow according to the
   storage capacity level. QAEC is firstly modeled as the Continuous Time
   Markov Chain (CTMC) and is realized by a cost function that comprises
   both flow-level and packet-level components to reflect the efforts on
   the evidence reconstruction process. We also present a prototype system
   (known as the MSN-Shot) as a MSN forensic system which uses QAEC to
   select an appropriate evidence collection strategy to maximize the given
   cost function. With the numerical analysis and prototype results, this
   study confirmed that the QAEC model meets cost-effective requirements
   and provides a practical security solution and guarantees a high level
   of quality assurance for network forensics.}},

Abstract = {{As the young mammal is unable to develop efficiently its own local
   immune responses in the first few days after birth, the passive mucosal
   protection of neonate piglets is dependent on the continuous supply
   until weaning of maternal immunoglobulin. To deep evaluate the efficacy
   of maternal vaccination in swine, in this research, virulence factor
   genes of prevalent E. coli isolates from diarrheic piglets were
   determined, and two dominant pathogenic Escherichia coli isolates were
   screened out and inactivated to use as antigens to vaccinate pregnant
   sows. The maternal immunity was evaluated based on the titers of
   antigen-specific milk antibodies, brush border cells adherence
   inhibition and the passive protective efficacy of newborn piglets. It
   was confirmed that maternal immunization could result 2 weeks in the
   appearance of F4- and F6- specific antibodies in the milk. In addition,
   the immune colostrum exhibited the ability to inhibit the binding of F4-
   and/or F6-positive E. coli to porcine brush borders, while the control
   samples without the blocking action. Furthermore, maternal vaccination
   could significantly reduce the diarrhea incidence rate from 55.5\% to
   15.2\%, and evidently postpone the disease time from day 6.32 to 12.29
   in average.}},

Abstract = {{Colloid-sized particles are commonly detected in vadose-zone pore waters
   and are capable of binding chemicals with sorptive affinities for
   geologic materials. Published research demonstrates that colloids are
   capable of facilitating the transport of sorptive contaminants under
   conditions of steady pore water flow, when volumetric moisture content
   and pore water velocity are constant Less is known about the role of
   colloids in governing contaminant mobility under transient-flow
   conditions, which are characteristic of natural vadose-zone
   environments. The objective of this study is to elucidate the influences
   of flow transients on the mobilization and transport of in situ colloids
   and colloid-associated contaminants. We conducted column experiments in
   which the mobilization of in situ colloids and Cs-137 was induced by
   transients associated with the drainage and imbibition of Cs-137
   contaminated-sediments. Our results demonstrate that substantial
   quantities of in situ colloids and colloid-associated Cs-137 are
   mobilized as volumetric moisture content declines during porous-medium
   drainage and as volumetric moisture content increases during
   porous-medium imbibition. We also find that the colloid-effect on Cs-137
   transport is sensitive to changes in pore water ionic strength. That is,
   the quantities of colloids mobilized and the capacity of the these
   colloids to bind Cs-137 decrease with increasing ionic strength, leading
   to a decrease of the mass of Cs-137 eluted from the columns during
   porous-medium drainage and imbibition.}},

   population changes, community care policy and improved methods of
   diagnosis (PHIS, 2004). Community nurses have relatively poor skills in
   detecting and managing mental health problems and identify training as a
   means of addressing this (Fox et al., 2003). To address the practice
   development needs identified by CLDNs through their Personal Development
   Plans (PDPs), secondments were provided to a Child and Adolescent Mental
   Health Service (CAMHS) for children and young people with learning
   disabilities for 2 days a week for six months. This was taken up by five
   CLDNs over a period of 3 years. The goals they set in their secondments
   were evaluated using Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS). This paper aims to
   discuss the use of GAS within secondments, as a means of identifying
   learning needs and developing practice in the area of CAMH nursing. The
   background to the paper, work based learning, health needs of children
   with LD and GAS are highlighted. Recommendations for future development
   are made. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we examined whether sociolinguistic awareness and false
   belief were uniquely related in 3- and 4-year-old Cantonese-speaking
   children learning English as a second language. The English-use
   background of these children varied so that they possessed
   sociolinguistic awareness to different degrees. Results indicated that
   sociolinguistic awareness predicted false belief uniquely after
   controlling for age, nonverbal intelligence, English vocabulary, and
   family income for both the second language learners and the more
   balanced bilinguals. The group difference in false belief was adequately
   explained by the corresponding difference in sociolinguistic awareness
   over and above the other variables. Such findings provide evidence for
   the claim that false belief understanding is critically related to
   sociolinguistic awareness, which in turn is influenced by how a second
   language is learned. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To assess the amount of structural loss (retinal nerve fiber
   layer {[}RNFL] thickness loss, macular thickness {[}MT] and volume
   {[}MV] measured by optical coherence tomography {[}OCT]) and functional
   loss (visual acuity {[}VA], visual field mean deviation {[}MD],
   brightness sensitivity, and red perception) necessary for a relative
   afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) to manifest in patients with glaucoma.
   METHODS. In this case-control study, 50 glaucoma patients were
   prospectively enrolled: 25 with RAPD and 25 without. The presence of an
   RAPD was determined and quantified using the swinging-flashlight test,
   with neutral-density filters. A separate examiner, masked to the
   pupillary findings, assessed participants for brightness sense, red
   perception, VA, MD, RNFL thickness, MT, and MV.
   RESULTS. Differences in RNFL thickness (P < 0.0001), brightness sense (P
   = 0.0007), red perception (P = 0.030), and MD (P < 0.0001) were found
   between control and RAPD patients, but not in visual acuity or macular
   OCT parameters. An absolute difference in RNFL thickness of 14.6 mu m or
   greater, inter-eye difference of 9.5 dB or greater, and brightness of
   less than 64\% in the weaker eye, were all associated with 100\%
   specificity of RAPD presence. When RNFL thickness was reduced to 83\% of
   the less advanced eye, the sensitivity and specificity of RAPD presence
   were 72\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 0.51-0.88) and 100\% (95\%
   CI, 0.86-1.00), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS. An RAPD was clinically detected in all participants in whom
   RNFL thickness decreased to 83\% of that in the less advanced eye.
   Subjective brightness is the most accurate clinical surrogate for
   detecting an RAPD in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. (Invest

Abstract = {{Introduction: The purpose of this study was to comparatively examine
   physicochemical and biocompatible properties of 20 wt\% bismuth oxide
   (Bi2O3)-containing dicalcium silicate cement and white-colored mineral
   trioxide aggregate (WMTA). Methods: The radiopacity, setting time,
   diametral tensile strength, pH value, morphology, and phase composition
   of the cements with and without Bi2O3 were measured after mixing powders
   with water. Cement biocompatibility was evaluated by incubating the
   cement specimens with MG63 human osteoblast-like cells. Results: The
   addition of Bi2O3 to the cement led to a significant increase (p<.05) in
   the setting time of 24 minutes. It was accompanied by a small decrease
   in the pH value but without adversely affecting diametral tensile
   strength. The radiopacity value of the Bi2O3-containing cement was
   equivalent to 7.3 mm of aluminum, which was significantly higher
   (p<0.05) than pure cement without Bi2O3 (1.1 mm of aluminum) but lower
   (p<.05) than WMTA (9.3 mm of aluminum). However, it was greater than 3
   mm of aluminum, which is the value recommended by ISO 6876/2001
   standards. MG63 cell viability cultured on Bi2O3-containing cement was
   higher than that cultured on WMTA at all culture times. Conclusions: The
   dicalcium silicate cement with 20 wt\% Bi2O3 showed shortened setting
   time and good biocompatibility and thus may have the potential to be a
   rootend filling material alternative to MTA. (J Endod 2010;36:1683-1687)}},

Abstract = {{Aim:
   The objective of this study was to assess the correlations between the
   detection of stress-associated hormone/oxidative stress markers in
   umbilical cord blood (CB) and the physical condition of the mother and
   neonate.
   Methods:
   CB units collected from normal vaginal deliveries were analyzed for
   various biochemical markers, some stress-associated hormones, such as
   progesterone, cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH),
   corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) and oxidative stress marker
   8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), respectively.
   Results:
   The progesterone concentration closely correlated with Apgar score,
   hemoglobin, maternal smoking and insulin concentration, respectively. In
   particular, its concentration in the non-smoker group and Apgar score 10
   points group was significantly lower in comparison to the smoker group
   and Apgar score 8 points group, respectively. Cortisol concentration
   correlated significantly with the number of parities, pre-pregnancy body
   mass index (BMI), and increase of neonatal weight and height per day,
   respectively. In particular, its concentration in deliveries of males
   and first babies was significantly higher in comparison to female
   deliveries and second babies, respectively. In addition, a significant
   correlation was observed between the duration between
   spontaneous/artificial membrane rupture time and delivery time and the
   ACTH concentration. However, no significant relationship was observed
   between maternal/neonatal factors and CRF concentration and 8-OHdG
   concentration, respectively. A significant negative correlation was
   observed between cortisol and 8-OHdG concentration.
   Conclusion:
   CB stress-associated hormone/oxidative stress markers strongly reflect
   maternal and neonatal condition at the time of delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The definitive surgical management of gastroschisis is the
   return of the eviscerated abdominal content into the abdomen as soon as
   possible.
   Objectives: Assess the efficacy of using a sutureless elastic ring silo
   (SERS) for the management of gastroschisis.
   Methods: Neonates with gastroschisis were enrolled at Songklanagarind
   Hospital between January 2006 and December 2008. A primary repair (PR)
   was attempted in all cases. If this was not possible due to concerns
   about abdominal compartment syndrome, a stage abdominal closure with a
   silo pouch was fashioned: a traditional silo (TS) or SERS. When the
   bowel was completely reduced, a second-stage closure was performed in
   the operating room. Data collected included general demographic data,
   size of defect, associated anomalies, hospital course, mode of
   gastroschisis closure, duration of parenteral nutrition (PN) and
   ventilator, first feeding age, complications, and length of hospital
   stay (LOS).
   Results: Twenty-nine children with gastroschisis were treated (PR: 9,
   TS: 9, and SERS: 11). There were no differences (p >0.05) concerning
   gender, mode of delivery, APGAR scores, gestational age, birth weight,
   or defect size. A preformed silo was employed in 20 of 29 cases, TS in
   nine (31\%), and SERS in 11(38\%) cases in an average operative time of
   80.6 and 40 minutes, respectively, a significantly shorter operative
   time in the SERS (p =0.007). Overall, there were no differences (p
   >0.05) concerning duration of ventilator support (10.2 days), duration
   of PN (21.3 days), first feeding age (15 days), LOS (26.5 days), and
   complication.
   Conclusion: The use of a sutureless elastic ring silo with readily
   available inexpensive materials is simple, safe and efficacious in our
   setting.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Conjunctival membranes are differentiated from pseudomembranes
   by bleeding on removal. The authors sought to study the cellular
   constituents and extracellular structure of formed conjunctival exudates
   in epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC), and to determine whether these
   represent true conjunctival membranes.
   Methods: Formed conjunctival exudates harvested from 2 patients with EKC
   were studied by immunohistochemistry. Adenoviral infection was evaluated
   by PCR.
   Results: Each patient's tears were PCR positive for adenovirus, but not
   HSV-I. Both conjunctival specimens contained a fibrinous stroma richly
   populated with cells positive for CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, myeloperoxidase,
   and fascin. Both specimens also contained cells positive for CD31 and
   Tie-2, and demonstrated expression of transforming growth factor-beta
   and vascular endothelial growth factor.
   Conclusions: Conjunctival exudates in EKC contain a range of leukocytes
   representing both innate and acquired immune responses, along with
   angiogenic factors and proliferating endothelial cells. Therefore, true
   conjunctival membranes can and do form in EKC.}},

Abstract = {{Marijuana smokers and animals treated with
   Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, the principal component of marijuana,
   show alterations of sperm morphology suggesting a role for cannabinoids
   in sperm differentiation and/or maturation. Because the cannabinoid
   receptor 1 (CNR1) activation appears to play a pivotal role in
   spermiogenesis, the developmental stage where DNA is remodeled, we
   hypothesized that CNR1 receptors might also influence chromatin quality
   in sperm. We used Cnr1 null mutant (Cnr1(-/-)) mice to study the
   possible role of endocannabinoids on sperm chromatin during
   spermiogenesis. We demonstrated that CNR1 activation regulated chromatin
   remodeling of spermatids by either increasing Tnp2 levels or enhancing
   histone displacement. Comparative analysis of wild-type, Cnr1(+/-), and
   Cnr1(-/-) animals suggested the possible occurrence of
   haploinsufficiency for Tnp2 turnover control by CNR1, whereas histone
   displacement was disrupted to a lesser extent. Furthermore, flow
   cytometry analysis demonstrated that the genetic loss of Cnr1 decreased
   sperm chromatin quality and was associated with sperm DNA fragmentation.
   This damage increased during epididymal transit, from caput to cauda.
   Collectively, our results show that the expression/activity of CNR1
   controls the physiological alterations of DNA packaging during
   spermiogenesis and epididymal transit. Given the deleterious effects of
   sperm DNA damage on male fertility, we suggest that the reproductive
   function of marijuana users may also be impaired by deregulation of the
   endogenous endocannabinoid system. (Endocrinology 151: 5017-5029, 2010)}},

Abstract = {{Staphylococcus aureus lipase is regarded as a virulence factor. The
   response of lipase activity to various factors can provide important
   insights concerning the prevention of S. carrells during meat
   fermentation. This study was conducted to evaluate the main effects of
   nutrients used in culture media, and their combined effects on the
   inhibition of lipase activity and cell growth of pathogenic S. aureus
   SK1593 isolated from fermented pork meat. A Plackett-Burman design was
   used to evaluate the main effects of variables, including olive oil,
   soybean oil, grapeseed oil, sesame oil, CuSO4, MgCl2, KNO3, CaCl2, and
   KCl. Significant negative effects on lipase activity were detected with
   soybean oil, grapeseed oil, KNO3, and CaCl2,. Additionally, these
   nutrients were further selected as variables for the investigation of
   their combined effect on lipase activity, via response surface
   methodology. In order to confirm the regression model, a situation that
   only inhibits lipase activity was simulated. The predicted lipase
   activity and cell growth of the simulated situation were 14.0 U/mL and
   9.6 log(10) (CFU/mL), respectively, and the estimated value of those in
   the same medium showed 15.14 U/mL and 9.4 log, (CFU/mL) respectively.
   The lipase activity of the simulated medium was inhibited approximately
   5-fold as compared to the basal medium, but no significant differences
   in cell counts were noted to exist between the basal and simulated
   media. These results suggest that soybean oil, grapeseed oil, KNO3, and
   CaCl2, can be used to inhibit the growth of pathogenic S. aureus during
   the process of meat fermentation.}},

   Single-cell performance of MEA at 0.7 V was increased by about 19\% with
   membrane that was etched for 10 min compared to that with untreated

   current density of 1700 mA cm(-2) at 0.35 V, which was 8\% higher than
   that of MEA with untreated membrane (1580 mA cm(-2)). The performances
   of MEAs containing etched membranes were affected by complex factors
   such as the thickness and surface morphology of the membrane related to

Abstract = {{Sulfur deprivation, which is considered as an efficient way to trigger
   long-term hydrogen photoproduction in unicellular green algae has two
   major effects: a decrease in PSII which allows anaerobiosis to be
   reached and carbohydrate (starch) storage. Starch metabolism has been
   proposed as one of the major factors of hydrogen production,
   particularly during the PSII-independent (or indirect) pathway. While
   starch biosynthesis has been characterized in the green alga
   Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, little remains known concerning starch
   degradation. In order to gain a better understanding of starch
   catabolism pathways and identify those steps likely to limit the
   starch-dependent hydrogen production, we have designed a genetic
   screening procedure aimed at isolating mutants of the green alga C.
   reinhardtii affected in starch mobilization. Using two different
   screening protocols, the first one based on aerobic starch degradation
   in the dark and the second one on anaerobic starch degradation in the
   light, eighteen mutants were isolated among a library of 15,000
   insertion mutants, eight (std1-8) with the first screen and ten
   (sda1-10) with the second. Most of the mutant strains isolated in this
   study showed a reduction or a delay in the PSII-independent hydrogen
   production. Further characterization of these mutants should allow the
   identification of molecular determinants of starch-dependent hydrogen
   production and supply targets for future biotechnological improvements.

Abstract = {{Background: Severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis is an unequivocal
   indication for surgical valve replacement, assuring symptoms relief and
   increasing survival. About one third of elderly patients is not being
   operated due to, among others, high pen-procedural risk and
   comorbidities. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has
   recently become a valuable therapeutic option for these patients.
   Aim: To present early results of first TAVI Edwards-Sapien procedures in
   our hospital, performed in symptomatic patients with high operational
   risk or other contraindications for conventional surgery, as well as the
   results of 6-month follow-up.
   Method: Twelve patients referred for TAVI were included in the analysis.
   The valve was implanted in 11 patients and in 1 patient the procedure
   was finished with aortic valve valvuloplasty. Eight (72.7\%) patients
   underwent transapical (TA) and 3 (27.3\%) patients transfemoral (TF)
   TAVI. Seven (63.6\%) 26 mm valves and 4 (34.4\%) 23 mm valves were
   implanted.
   Results: The efficacy of the procedure was 92\%: 100\% in the TA group,
   and 75\% in the TF group. During the procedure 1 patient developed
   ventricular fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation and right ventricle
   perforation by the endocavitary electrode was observed in another
   patient. Prolonged wound healing occurred in 4 patients and
   contrast-induced renal failure occurred in 2 patients. There were no
   deaths at 30-days. Two patients had a pacemaker implanted during
   hospitalisation. A significant improvement of echocardiographic
   parameters was observed: maximum gradient across the aortic valve was
   104.4 +/- 23.9 mm Hg before vs 25.2 +/- 6.1 mm Hg after the
   intervention, p = 0.000001, mean gradient - 63.8 +/- 18.3 vs 12.7 +/-
   3.7 mm Hg, p = 0.000004, and valvular surface - 0.7 +/- 0.2 vs 1.5 +/-
   0.2 cm(2), p = 0.000106, respectively. During the 6-month follow-up
   period 1 patient died of multiorgan failure and 6 patients required
   another hospitalisation. After 6 months an improvement in physical
   capacity was observed in all but one patients (NYHA II - 9 patients,
   NYHA III - 1 patient).
   Conclusions: 1. The authors' initial experiences with TAVI
   Edwards-Sapien procedure confirm its efficacy and safety in patients
   with symptomatic aortic stenosis and high surgical risk. 2.
   Echocardiographic parameters of the implanted valves, assessed during
   hospitalisation and 6 month later, are satisfactory. 3. Due to the risk
   of complications, patients require careful observation in the
   postoperative period and during short-term follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study evaluated the relationships between estimated
   glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and carotid atherosclerosis,
   peripheral arterial disease (PAD), arterial stiffness, and left
   ventricular hypertrophy, independent of albuminuria.
   Methods: The study population consisted of 6694 people aged 50 years and
   older who participated in the baseline survey of the Dong-gu Study
   conducted in Korea between 2007 and 2009. The common carotid artery
   intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), carotid plaque, ankle-brachial index
   (ABI), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), and left ventricular
   mass index (LVMI) of each subjects was assessed.
   Results: After adjustment for risk factors and albumin-creatinine ratio
   (ACR), kidney dysfunction (eGFR = 30-44 ml/min per 1.73m(2)) was
   significantly associated with carotid plaque presence (odds ratio
   {[}OR], 1.75; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.21-2.53) and PAD (OR,
   2.64; 95\% CI, 1.51-4.62) compared to normal kidney function (eGFR >= 60
   ml/min per 1.73m2). Similarly, mean LVMI and baPWV differed
   significantly according to eGFR after adjustment for other risk factors
   and ACR; in contrast, no significant difference was observed for
   CCA-IMT.
   Conclusions: Independent of albuminuria, eGFR is associated with carotid
   plaque, PAD, baPWV, and LVMI but not with CCA-IMT in Koreans aged 50
   years and older. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Pharmacokinetic interaction between itraconazole and metformin in rats:
   competitive inhibition of metabolism of each drug by each other via
   hepatic and intestinal CYP3A1/2}},
Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   Fungal infection is prevalent in patients with diabetes mellitus. Thus,
   we investigated whether a pharmacokinetic interaction occurs between the
   anti-fungal agent itraconazole and the anti-glycaemic drug metformin, as
   both drugs are commonly administered together to diabetic patients and
   are metabolized via hepatic CYP3A subfamily in rats.
   EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
   Itraconazole (20 mg.kg(-1)) and metformin (100 mg.kg(-1)) were
   simultaneously administered i.v. and p.o. to rats. Concentrations (I) of
   each drug in the liver and intestine, maximum velocity (V-max),
   Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and intrinsic clearance (CLint) for the
   disappearance of each drug, apparent inhibition constant (K-i) and
   {[}I]/Ki ratios of each drug in the liver and intestine were determined.
   Also the metabolism of each drug in rat and human CYPs was measured in
   vitro. KEY
   KEY RESULTS
   After simultaneous administration of both drugs, either i.v. or p.o.,
   the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero
   to infinity (AUC)s of itraconazole and metformin were significantly
   greater than that of either drug administered alone. The metabolism of
   itraconazole and metformin was significantly inhibited by each other via
   CYP3A1 and 3A2 in rat and 3A4 in human microsomes.
   CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
   The significantly greater AUCs of itraconazole and metformin after i. v.
   administration of both drugs are probably due to competitive inhibition
   of the metabolism of each drug by each other via hepatic CYP3A1/2.
   Whereas after oral administration of both drugs, the significantly
   greater AUCs of each drug administered together than that of either drug
   alone is mainly due to competitive inhibition of intestinal metabolism
   of each drug by each other via intestinal CYP3A1/2.}},

Abstract = {{A gas turbine abruptly tripped to a stop during its daily morning

   blade failure accidents in the same plant during the last 10 years.
   First, the fracture surface of the troubled blade was investigated.
   Stress analysis of the blade showed that the maximum stress occurred due
   to the pressure profiles developed during operation. Modal analysis for
   one blade and the assembly of blades was performed and Campbell diagram
   and Interference diagram were drawn to check the dynamic characteristics
   of the blades. The vibration of the turbine was measured using
   accelerometers during the operation condition. The result shows that the
   fatigue fracture of the blade was originated during transient events
   internal to the combustion chamber which was close to the resonance
   condition of the assembled blades.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PAIN}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{950-957}},

Abstract = {{Development of tolerance, inadequate relief, and potential toxicity of
   classical antinociceptives warrant the investigation of the newer agents
   to relieve diabetic neuropathic pain. The aim of the present study was
   to explore the effect of sesamol on thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia,
   allodynia, oxidative-nitrosative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in
   STZ-induced experimental diabetes. Diabetic rats developed neuropathy,
   which was evident from a marked hyperalgesia and allodynia associated
   with enhanced nitrosative stress, release of inflammatory mediators
   (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, TGF-1 beta), and caspase 3. Chronic treatment
   with sesamol (2, 4, and 8 mg/kg body weight; po) for 4 weeks starting
   from the 4th week of STZ injection significantly attenuated behavioral,
   biochemical, and molecular changes associated with diabetic neuropathy.
   Moreover, diabetic rats treated with insulin-sesamol combination
   produced more pronounced beneficial effect as compared to their per se
   groups. The major finding of the study is that insulin alone corrected
   the hyperglycemia and partially reversed the pain response in diabetic
   rats. However, the combination with sesamol not only attenuated the
   diabetic condition but also reversed neuropathic pain through modulation
   of oxidative-nitrosative stress, inflammatory cytokine release, and
   caspase-3 in diabetic rats, and thus it may find clinical application to
   treat neuropathic pain in the diabetic patient.
   Perspective: This study shows the beneficial effect of sesamol on
   neuropathic pain through modulation of oxidative-nitrosative stress,
   inflammatory cytokine release, and caspase-3 in diabetic rats, and thus
   it may find clinical application to treat neuropathic pain in the
   diabetic patient. (C) 2010 by the American Pain Society}},

   metalloproteinases (MMPs) are known to degrade components of the
   extracellular matrix. More recently, in myocardial oxidative stress
   injury including ischemia-reperfusion, MMP-2 is activated and degrades
   troponin I and alpha-actinin. MMP activity is regulated at several
   levels. We recently showed that MMP-2 is localized in the caveolae of
   cardiomyocytes and is negatively regulated by caveolin-1 (Cav-1). The
   caveolin scaffolding domain of Cav-1 inhibits MMP-2 proteolytic activity
   in vitro, and Cav-1(-/-) mouse hearts have increased MMP-2 activity
   compared with controls. Whether this increase in MMP-2 activity
   translates to impaired cardiac function is unknown. Hearts isolated from
   Cav-1(-/-) mice and their wild-type controls were perfused as isolated
   working hearts and physiologically challenged with increasing increments
   of left atrial preload (7-22.5 mmHg). The hearts were then
   pharmacologically challenged with increasing concentrations of
   isoproterenol (0.1-100 nM). Functionally, the Cav-1(-/-) hearts were
   similar to the controls in heart rate, peak systolic pressure, developed
   pressure, and rate pressure product. At higher preload pressures, the
   Cav-1(-/-) hearts outperformed the control hearts. Coronary flow was
   significantly higher in Cav-1(-/-) hearts under all conditions. The
   highest concentration of isoproternol increased the heart rate of
   Cav-1(-/-) hearts more than in controls. Western blot analysis revealed
   no significant changes in troponin I or alpha-actinin between Cav-1(-/-)
   hearts and their controls. There was a significant loss of MMP-2 from
   both knockout and control hearts during the perfusion. In summary,
   despite the loss of Cav-1, Cav-1(-/-) hearts show similar or better
   cardiac function compared with wild-type hearts following physiological
   challenge or beta-adrenergic stimulation in vitro, and this appears
   unrelated to changes in MMP-2.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study aimed to assess the accuracy of two-dimensional
   echocardiography (echo) in diagnosing unicuspid aortic valve (UAV) and
   to determine echo features that could improve the diagnosis. Method: We
   reviewed transthoracic/transesophageal echoes (TTE/TEE) from our
   hospital database for adult patients who had aortic valve surgery with a
   preoperative echo diagnosis of UAV or equivocal diagnosis of bicuspid
   aortic valve (BAV) BAV/UAV. Morphological characteristics of AV and
   ascending aortic dimensions were evaluated. Results: Nineteen patients
   were identified, 13 (11 Male, 2 Female, mean age 47 +/- 10 years) had
   surgically confirmed diagnosis of UAV, six had BAV. The incidence of UAV
   was 2.6\%. For diagnosing UAV, the sensitivity and specificity of TIE
   was 27\% and 50\% and those of TEE was 75\% and 86\%, respectively. For
   TTE, positive predictive value (PPV) was 60\% and negative predictive
   value (NPV) was 20\%. By TEE, PPV was 90\% and the NPV was 67\%. In UAV
   patients, 85\% had severe aortic stenosis (mean gradient 45 +/- 16 mmHg,
   AVA: 0.9 +/- 0.2 cm(2)). 46\% had ascending aorta aneurysm (mean aortic
   root, sinutubular junction, ascending aorta dimensions: 36 +/- 3 mm, 31
   +/- 4 mm and 41 +/- 8 mm). Patients with ascending aortic aneurysm were
   younger (41 +/- 11 years vs. 52 +/- 5 years, P < 0.05) All UAV were
   unicommissural with a posteriorly positioned commissural attachment,
   69\% were heavily calcified. Diagnostic accuracy was limited by quality
   of images, severity, and distribution of calcification. Conclusion: TEE
   is the diagnostic modality of choice in UAV. Identifying several echo
   features may improve its diagnostic accuracy. (Echocardiography

Abstract = {{Ten years (1998-2007) of sea-level anomalies (SLA) from multiple
   satellite altimeters and chlorophyll-a concentration from the
   Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) were used to detect eddy
   pumping/advection of nutrients by the action of propagating Rossby waves
   in the Kuroshio Extension (ME) region near 35 degrees N after the
   seasonal SeaWiFS chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations cycles and annual
   changes of altimeter SLA were eliminated. Spatial structure of Chl-a
   anomalies to the seasonal cycle is examined in relation to altimeter
   eddy structure. Eddy propagation speeds and scales by the Rossby waves
   are also identified. Chl-a structure is evident during the spring bloom
   period with a scale around 460 km. Cold-core (cyclonic) rings correspond
   to areas of high Chl-a concentrations. Warm-core (anticyclonic) rings
   relate to areas of low Chl-a concentration. Chl-a anomalies and SLA have
   an overall modest negative correlation coefficient of r=-0.45, which may
   imply the co-existence of both eddy pumping and eddy advection
   mechanisms in the ME region. Swirl currents between eddies redistribute
   surface chlorophyll concentrations and can spatially bias maximum and
   minimum concentration levels off eddy center. The correlation
   coefficient has seasonal fluctuations. In the western ME region, it
   varies from high negative correlation (r=-0.70) in April and September
   (eddy pumping dominant) to low negative correlation (r=-0.33) in
   February and March (eddy advection dominant). In the eastern ME region,
   it varies from high negative correlation (r=-0.67) in February to low
   negative correlation (r=-0.42) in December. It is noted that the
   characteristic wavelengths of the SLA and Chl-a features, and the
   seasonality of the correlation between these two variables have not been
   previously documented. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We disclose in this paper properties of a composition TeGa2Sb7 selected
   from the pseudo-tie line Sb80Te20-GaSb in Te-Ga-Sb system. TeGa2Sb7 film
   possesses crystallization temperature 236 degrees C and
   activation-energy of crystallization 5.76 eV, by Kissinger's peak-shift
   method. The study on failure-time versus isothermal temperatures fits in
   an Arrhenius plot, which can be extrapolated to the 10 year data
   retention at 200 degrees C. Grazing-incident X-ray diffraction shows
   that crystallized TeGa2Sb7 films compose of a single HCP phase.
   Electrical resistance decreases by four orders-of-magnitude upon
   crystallization. Memory switching is verified using a
   bridge-memory-cell. TeGa2Sb7 is a potential for phase-change memory
   anticipating high thermal stability. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Chordia et al. (2008, hereafter CRS) examine short horizon return
   predictability from past order flows of large, actively traded NYSE
   firms across three tick size regimes and conclude that higher liquidity
   facilitates arbitrage trading which enhances market efficiency. We
   extend CRS to a comprehensive sample of all NYSE firms and examine the
   dynamics between liquidity and market efficiency during informational
   periods. Our results indicate that although all NYSE firms experience an
   overall improvement in market efficiency across periods of different
   tick size regimes, this improvement varies significantly across the
   portfolios of sample companies formed on the basis of trading frequency,
   market capitalization, and trading volume. After controlling for these
   factors, we further document a positive association between a continuous
   measure of liquidity and market efficiency, and show that this effect is
   amplified during periods that contain new information, as reflected in
   high adverse selection component of the bid-ask spread. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{It has been reported that both nicardipine and lovastatin are substrates
   of both the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A subfamily and P-glycoprotein
   (P-gp), and P-gp transport is unlikely to be a significant factor. Thus,
   the effects of oral lovastatin on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous
   and oral nicardipine were investigated in rats. Nicardipine was
   administered intravenously (4 mg/kg) and orally (12 mg/kg) with 0
   (control), 0.3 and 1 mg/kg of oral lovastatin to rats. Lovastatin was
   administered 30min before nicardipine administration. After intravenous
   administration of nicardipine with 0, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg of lovastatin, the
   total areas under the plasma concentration time curve from time zero to
   infinity (AUCs) of nicardipine were not changed by lovastatin. However,
   after oral administration of nicardipine with 1 mg/kg of oral
   lovastatin, the AUC of nicardipine was significantly greater (by
   67.4\%), and the extent of absolute oral bioavailability (F) of
   nicardipine was increased (by 38.5\%). The above data suggest that
   lovastatin did not considerably inhibit the metabolism of nicardipine
   via the hepatic CYP3A subfamily, but inhibited intestinal P-gp and/or
   the CYP3A subfamily. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated allozyme variation in 16 populations of the rare
   monotypic fern Mankyua chejuense and 11 populations of a closely
   related, widespread fern Botrychium ternatum. Genetic diversity was
   extremely low in the critically endangered M. chejuense (\%P(s) = 10\%,
   A(s) = 1.13, and H(es) = 0.007) relative to that found in B. ternatum
   (\%P(s) = 22.7\%, A(s) = 1.23, and H(es) = 0.026). We detected
   homozygous genotypes for alternative alleles at a few loci, which
   suggests occurrence of intragametophytic self-fertilization. High
   degrees of population differentiation were found in both M. chejuense
   (F(ST) = 0.245) and B. ternatum (F(ST) = 0.414). The extremely low
   levels of genetic diversity in M. chejuense would be attributable to
   inbreeding coupled with random genetic drift and rarity. In situ
   protection of habitats of standing populations and ex situ preservation
   of several populations are suggested for the development of conservation
   strategies for M. chejuense. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hypothesis: This study reviewed 20 consecutive shoulders that underwent
   total shoulder arthroplasty with a partially cemented glenoid component
   at a minimum follow-up of 5 years. We hypothesized that bone growth
   between the fins of the component would result in improved glenoid
   fixation and reduced lucent line formation.
   Methods: Patients were evaluated with the Simple Shoulder Test (SST),
   Constant scores, and radiographs. Postoperative radiographs taken at 6
   weeks and 5 years were compared Independent evaluators assigned every
   glenoid a lucency grade from 0 (no lucency) to 5 (gross lucency) and
   assessed the central peg for bone presence between the fins
   Results: Mean SST and Constant scores were 11.1 and 82.4, respectively
   Mean lucency scores increased from 0.1 to 0.3 from 6 weeks to the 5-year
   follow-up (P = 05). At the 5-year follow-up, 15 of 20 patients had
   similar or increased bone presence between the central peg fins. and
   none had a worsening lucency score The 5 patients with decreased or
   absent bone presence had worsening lucency scores, from a mean of 0.2 to
   1 0 (P = 05). There was no difference in SST score (P = .54) or Constant
   score (P = 37) between the two groups
   Conclusions: This partially cemented glenoid component had low rates of
   lucency at the 5-year follow-up Similar or increased bone growth between
   the fins of the central peg was associated with no progression of
   glenoid lucencies Decreased or absent bone presence between the fins at
   follow-up correlated with slight advancement of glenoid lucent lines.

Abstract = {{Microdialysis has been utilized for nutritive blood flow measurements,
   but both the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches have not
   been evaluated in parallel in the stomach yet. Our aim was to compare
   the (H2O)-H-3 efflux technique with biochemical monitoring during
   temporary celiac artery occlusion in anesthetized rats. Microdialysis
   probes were implanted in the gastric submucosa and perfused with
   (H2O)-H-3; samples were analyzed for beta-activity, glucose, lactate,
   pyruvate and glycerol. Gastric mucosa and plasma were subjected to
   morphometry and analysis of myeloperoxidase, total thiols and
   lactatdehydrogenase. The most dramatic responses to ischemia were
   observed in lactate/pyruvate and lactate/glucose (\%) ratios (6.1-9.3x,
   p < 0.0001); the changes in (H2O)-H-3 efflux and glycerol were less
   pronounced (1.1-1.7x, p < 0.0001 and < 0.01, respectively). (H2O)-H-3
   efflux correlated best with the lactate/glucose ratio and glucose alone
   (r = 0.693 and -0.681, respectively, p < 0.0001). A correlation was also
   found between plasma lactatdehydrogenase and relative glycerol release
   (r = 0.600, p < 0.05). Myeloperoxidase, lactatdehydrogenase and
   histology score were increased by ischemia/reperfusion (0.06-0.12 nkat
   g(-1), p < 0.05, 0.26-0.44 nkat g(-1), p < 0.05 and 1.79-2.33, p < 0.05,
   respectively), macroscopy and plasma thiols remained unchanged.
   Microdialysis is useful in monitoring gastric ischemia, metabolic
   monitoring being superior to the (H2O)-H-3 efflux technique. The results
   question the efficacy of the utilized model to produce standardized
   major gastric damage.}},

Abstract = {{Thermally expandable microspheres (TEMs) consist of a copolymer shell
   encapsulating a liquid hydrocarbon core and expand irreversibly to many
   times their original volume on heating. In this work commercial TEMs
   with a mean diameter of approximately 13 mu m were coated with either
   polypyrrole, polyaniline or poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) {[}PEDOT]
   at conducting polymer mass loadings of 0.1 to 1.5\%. Laser diffraction
   showed that aqueous suspensions of these conducting polymer-coated TEMs
   were well-dispersed, indicating minimal particle aggregation. Scanning
   electron microscopy studies indicated that these TEMs have relatively
   rough surfaces both before and after coating with conducting polymer.
   Raman spectroscopy was very sensitive to the presence of conducting
   polymer and could be used to confirm the presence of polypyrrole at
   target mass loadings as low as 0.1 wt\%. The presence of polypyrrole at
   the TEM surface was confirmed from the Cl/N atomic ratios determined by
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. This technique allowed the
   polypyrrole-coated TEMs to be ranked correctly according to their
   targeted conducting polymer loadings. All the conducting polymer-coated
   TEMs were subjected to irradiation using a near-infrared lamp with a
   lambda(max) of 1200 nm. Since conducting polymers absorb strongly in the
   near-infrared region, this leads to efficient localised heating of the
   coated TEMs. Thus the onset time required for the expansion of
   conducting polymer-coated TEMs under a given set of irradiation
   conditions is reduced significantly compared to control experiments
   conducted with uncoated TEMs (from 162 +/- 2 seconds to 11 +/- 1
   seconds). For the polypyrrole-coated TEMs, systematic reduction of the
   target polypyrrole mass loading from 1.5 to 0.3\% had surprisingly
   little effect on the observed onset times for volumetric expansion.
   Polypyrrole, polyaniline and PEDOT-coated TEMs all exhibited similar
   onset times (10 +/- 1 seconds) when compared at the same mass loading
   (1.5\%). However, EDOT is relatively expensive compared to pyrrole and
   polymerisation of the former monomer is substantially incomplete even at
   50 degrees C. Moreover, aniline is significantly more toxic than pyrrole
   and its polymerisation requires a more expensive oxidant. Thus it is
   concluded that polypyrrole is the preferred conducting polymer for
   coating TEMs in order to optimise their thermo-responsive volumetric
   expansion behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{In Europe, biomass represents an important renewable source, sharing the
   highest percentage (61.4 \%), followed by hydro power with 31.9 \%.
   Other energy resources, namely wind, geothermal and solar, taken
   together, stand for only 6.7\%. Romania has a high biomass energy
   potential, estimated at some 7.594 million tons/year (318 PJ/year = 318
   . 105 J/year), representing almost 19 \% of the total consumption of
   primary resources, by 2000. Potential reserves are wood waste,
   agricultural waste (animal and vegetable) household waste and energy
   crops. Taking this national and international context, the actuality of
   the paper, focusing on an experimental research concerning the
   utilization of waste biomass resources, is most important. It mainly
   highlights technical possibilities to generate biogas, based and
   assuming specific parameters for two varieties of woody biomass
   residues, both in terms of determining main physicochemical
   characteristics and behavior along the anaerobic fermentation process,
   resulting in bio-energy generation. The two tested varieties are the
   linden and lime beech sawdust. The main parameters of the process:
   temperature, pH and the pressure values, correlated with the parameters
   obtained previously during measurements conducted on a pilot plant, are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Uncemented, threaded acetabular components with smooth surface treatment
   were widely used in continental Europe in the 1970s and 1980s for
   primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). Previously published studies
   showed high failure rates in the mid-term. In a consecutive series of
   116 patients, 127 threaded cups with smooth surface treatment (Weill
   cup; Zimmer, Winterthur, Switzerland) were implanted in combination with
   one type of uncemented stem. Patients were followed up clinically and
   radiographically. Mean time of follow-up was 17 years (range 15-20). At
   the time of follow-up, the acetabular component had been revised or was
   awaiting revision in 30 hips (24\%). Two hips were revised for infection
   and 23 for aseptic loosening. Four polyethylene liners were exchanged
   because of excessive wear. One hip was awaiting revision. The survival
   rate for all acetabular revisions including one hip awaiting revision
   was 75\% (95\%CI: 65-85\%) at 17 years. These results support the view
   that smooth, threaded acetabular components do not provide satisfactory
   long-term fixation and should be abandoned. It is important to closely
   monitor patients with these components as the failure rate remains high
   in the long-term.}},

Abstract = {{In 10- to 13-year-old children with asthma, we know less than is
   desirable about the nature of the disease management tasks they face as
   youngsters approaching adolescence. This article reviews aspects of
   asthma management in youngsters at a time of significant transition.
   They experience puberty and growth spurts. Their cognitive abilities
   enable more abstract thinking. They seek individuation from their
   parents and socialization with peers. These factors influence asthma
   outcomes, including symptom control, health care use, and school
   attendance and performance. Furthermore, significant sex- and
   gender-related differences in outcome exist. Those with asthma who are
   10 to 13 years of age contend not only with the particular management
   demands their chronic condition imposes on them but also the challenges
   associated with maturation. Most asthma management interventions do not
   account for the challenges faced at this transitional phase, and

   The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of short-term
   hormonal treatments using Norgestomet reused implants on the estrous
   cycle control in dairy goats. Thirty five goats were divided in five
   homogeneous groups of seven animals each one. All female from the groups
   T1, T2 and T3 received 1/3 of Norgestomet implant of 1st, 2nd and 3rd
   use, respectively, + eCG (260 IU) + cloprostenol (75 mu g); in the T4
   group, 1/2 Norgetomet implant of 2nd use + eCG (260 IU) + cloprostenol
   (75 mu g) and the T5 group, sponge impregnated with MAP + eCG (260 RI) +
   cloprostenol (75 mu g). The AI was developed 45 +/- 1 hours after
   finishing hormonal treatment. In data analysis the Qui-square test was
   used to compare hot female number and pregnant rate while the
   characteristics: the final interval of the treatment-onset estrus
   (FT-OE), and estrus length (EL), were compared by Duncan tests using the
   statistic software (SAEG, 2000). The estrus behavior was observed in
   100.0\%, 85.7\%, 85.7\%, 100.0\% and 100.0\% of goats from T1 to T5
   groups, respectively. The FT-OE intervals in the T3 and T4 (17.0 +/- 5.9
   h and 15.4 +/- 9.1 hours) were smaller (P<0.05) than T1, T2 and T5
   groups (29.1 +/- 15.3; 23.0 +/- 7.0 and 30.0 +/- 6.9 hours; in the same
   order), which did not differ from each other. The T1 and T3 groups,
   showed a bigger and a smaller variation on the FT-OE interval,
   respectively (48 and 12 hours). The estrus length was similar in all
   groups (24.9 +/- 9.4; 28.0 +/- 9.8; 27.0 +/- 6.3; 22.3 +/- 5.7 and 24.0
   +/- 6.9 hours; from T1 to T5). The pregnant rate of the T3 group
   (14.3\%) was smaller (P<0.05) than other groups T1, T2 and T5 that did
   not differ from each other (71.4\%; 71.4\%; 85.7\% and 71.4\%, to T1,
   T2, T4 and T5, respectively). In conclusion, the use of 1/3 of 3rd use
   implant, although being effective for estrus induction, it doesn't
   provide a satisfactory pregnant rate. On the other hand, the fractions
   of 1/3 of 1st and 2nd use implant of Norgestomet are efficient for
   estrus and ovulation synchronization, making possible to achieve
   satisfactory pregnant rate and recommend its use in fixed-time
   artificial insemination programs in dairy goats.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial organisation of the Ca2+ signal in microdomains enables the
   regulation of various processes in specific regions of the cell and is
   essential for the versatility of cell responses to various stimuli. Ca2+
   signals can be independently regulated in the cytoplasm and in the
   nucleoplasm. Increases in the concentration of Ca2+ in the nucleus can
   have specific effects different from those due to increases of Ca2+ in
   the cytoplasm. We investigated the influence of cell polarity on the
   subcellular distribution of molecules responsible for intracellular Ca2+
   homeostasis (Ca2+ release channels, Ca2+ pumps and Ca2+ binding
   proteins) and its influence on the intracellular Ca2+ signal in MOCK
   cells with respect to its cytoplasmic or nucleoplasmic localisation. The
   intracellular Ca2+ store was largely reorganised during cell
   polarisation, with a differential redistribution of IP3R, Ca2+-binding
   proteins and SERCA between the nuclear envelope and the periphery of the
   cell. This was accompanied by morphological changes in cell shape, which
   condense the cytoplasm around the nucleus, and in the shape of the
   nucleus, resulting in invaginations of the nuclear envelope. This
   facilitates Ca2+ exchanges between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm,
   and preserves the ability to generate nucleoplasmic Ca2+ transients in
   agonist-stimulated polarised MDCK cells. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Effect of induction of subacute ruminal acidosis on milk fat profile and

Abstract = {{High-concentrate diets can lead to subacute ruminal acidosis and are
   known to result in changes of the ruminal fermentation pattern and
   mammary secretion of fatty acids. The objective of this paper is to
   describe modifications in milk fatty acid proportions, particularly odd-
   and branched-chain fatty acids and rumen biohydrogenation intermediates,
   associated with rumen parameters during a 6-wk subacute ruminal acidosis
   induction protocol with 12 ruminally fistulated multiparous cows. The
   protocol involved a weekly gradual replacement of a standard dairy
   concentrate with a wheat-based concentrate (610 g of wheat/kg of
   concentrate) during the first 5 wk and an increase in the total amount
   of concentrate in wk 6. Before the end of induction wk 6, cows were
   switched to a control diet because 7 cows showed signs of sickness. The
   pH was measured continuously by an indwelling pH probe. Milk and rumen
   samples were taken on d 2 and 7 of each week. Data were analyzed using a
   linear mixed model and by principal component analysis. A pH decrease
   occurred after the first concentrate switch but rumen parameters
   returned to the original values and remained stable until wk 5. In wk 5
   and 6, rumen pH values were indicative of increasing acidotic
   conditions. After switching to the control diet in wk 6; rumen pH values
   rapidly achieved normal values. Odd- and branched-chain fatty acids and
   C18:1 trans-10 increased with increasing amount of concentrate in the
   diet, whereas C18:1 trans-11 decreased. Four fatty acids {[}C18:1
   trans-10, C15:0 and C17:0+C17:1 cis-9 (negative loadings), and iso C14:0
   (positive loading)] largely correlated with the first principal
   component (PC1); with cows spread along the PC1 axis. The first 4 wk of
   the induction experiment showed variation across the second principal
   component (PC2) only, with high loadings of anteiso C13:0 (negative
   loading) and C18:2 cis-9,trans-11 and C18:1 trans-11 (positive
   loadings). Weeks 5 and 6 deviated from PC2 and tended toward the
   negative PC1 axis. A discriminant analysis using a stepwise approach
   indicated the main fatty acids discriminating between the control and
   acidotic samples as iso C13:0, iso C16:0, and C18:2 cis-9. trans-11
   rather than milk fat content. or C18:1 trans-10; which have been used
   before as indicators of acidosis. This shows that specific milk fatty
   acids have potential in discriminating acidotic cases.}},

Abstract = {{The present study prospectively tracks 999 juvenile delinquents (499
   females) released from New York State correctional facilities in the
   early 1990s and describes their engagement in two socially problematic
   behaviors in early adulthood: child maltreatment and crime. By age 28,
   nearly two-thirds of sample girls were investigated by child protective
   services for alleged acts of child maltreatment and over half became
   clients of both the child welfare and adult criminal justice systems.
   Prevalence of maltreatment perpetration and dual-system contact were
   lower for boys but still worrisome. Findings add to a growing body of
   research documenting the overlap between criminal justice and child
   welfare populations and highlight the need for greater integration
   between these systems, particularly when dealing with female clients.

Abstract = {{Introduction. Firefighters who become lost, disoriented, or trapped in a
   burning building may die after running out of air in their
   self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). An emergency escape device
   has been developed that attaches to the firefighter's mask in place of
   the SCBA regulator. The device filters out particulate matter and a
   number of hazardous components of smoke (but does not provide oxygen),
   providing additional time to escape after the firefighter runs out of
   SCBA air. Objective. To field-test the device under realistic fire
   conditions to 1) ascertain whether it provides adequate protection from
   carbon monoxide (CO) and 2) examine firefighters' impressions of the
   device and its use. Methods. A wood-frame house was fitted with
   atmospheric monitors, and levels of CO, oxygen, and hydrogen cyanide
   were continuously recorded. After informed consent was obtained,
   firefighters wearing the escape device instead of their usual SCBA
   regulators entered the burning structure and spent 10 minutes breathing
   through the device. A breath CO analyzer was used to estimate (+/- 3
   ppm) each subject's carboxyhemoglobin level immediately upon exiting the
   building, vital signs and pulse oximetry were assessed, and each
   firefighter was asked for general impressions of the device. Results.
   Thirteen subjects were enrolled (all male, mean age 42.5 years, mean
   weight 94 kg). The mean peak CO level at the floor in the rooms where
   the subjects were located was 546 ppm, and ceiling CO measurements
   ranged from 679 ppm to the meters' maximum of 1,000 ppm, indicating
   substantial CO exposure. The firefighters' mean carboxyhemoglobin level
   was 1.15\% (range 0.8\%-2.1\%) immediately after exit. All pulse
   oximetry readings were 95\% or greater. No subject reported problems or
   concerns regarding the device, no symptoms suggestive of smoke
   inhalation or toxicity were reported, and all subjects expressed
   interest in carrying the device while on duty. Conclusion. The emergency
   escape device provides excellent protection from CO in realistic fire
   scenarios with substantial exposure to toxic gases, and the firefighters
   studied had a positive impression of the device and its use.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. We provide estimates of several leading US adult health
   indicators by sexual orientation identity and gender to fill gaps in the
   current literature.
   Methods. We aggregated data from the 2001-2008 Massachusetts Behavioral
   Risk Factor Surveillance surveys (N=67359) to examine patterns in
   self-reported health by sexual orientation identity and gender, using
   multivariable logistic regression.
   Results. Compared with heterosexuals, sexual minorities (i.e.,
   gays/lesbians, 2\% of sample; bisexuals, 1\%) were more likely to report
   activity limitation, tension or worry, smoking, drug use, asthma,
   lifetime sexual victimization, and HIV testing, but did not differ on
   3-year Papanicolaou tests, lifetime mammography, diabetes, or heart
   disease. Compared with heterosexuals, bisexuals reported more barriers
   to health care, current sadness, past-year suicidal ideation, and
   cardiovascular disease risk. Gay men were less likely to be overweight
   or obese and to obtain prostate-specific antigen tests, and lesbians
   were more likely to be obese and to report multiple risks for
   cardiovascular disease. Binge drinking and lifetime physical intimate
   partner victimization were more common among bisexual women.
   Conclusions. Sexual orientation disparities in chronic disease risk,
   victimization, health care access, mental health, and smoking merit
   increased attention. More research on heterogeneity in health and health
   determinants among sexual minorities is needed. (Am J Public Health.

Abstract = {{Purpose: The study was planned to assess whether combat equipment weight

   in female border police infantry recruits taking a 4-month course of
   basic combat training. Method: 213 female border police recruits, 18-19
   years of age, undergoing 16 weeks of basic combat training with lighter
   rifle and lighter closely fitted combat vest, (total 9.4 kg) were
   followed prospectively for stress fracture (SFx) incidence, compared to
   a historical control group of 1,210 recruits who trained with
   traditional equipment (12.5 kg). Results: Equipment modification was
   associated with a significant reduction in SFx from 18.3\% in the
   control group to 8.0\% in the intervention group (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: This study implies that equipment weight reduction may
   achieve a significant effect in SFx reduction. Approximating fighting
   gear to body center of gravity may enhance this effect.}},

Abstract = {{The Campos, Santos and Pelotas basins have been investigated in terms of
   2D seismo-stratigraphy and subsidence. The processes controlling
   accommodation space (e.g. eustacy, subsidence, sediment input) and the
   evolution of the three basins are discussed. Depositional seismic
   sequences in the syn-rift Barremian to the drift Holocene basin fill
   have been identified. In addition, the subsidence/uplift history has
   been numerically modeled including (i) sediment flux, (ii) sedimentary
   basin framework, (iii) relation to plate-tectonic reconfigurations, and
   (iv) mechanism of crustal extension. Although the initial rift
   development of the three basins is very similar, basin architecture,
   sedimentary infill and distribution differ considerably during the
   syn-rift sag to the drift basin stages. After widespread late Aptian
   early Albian salt and carbonate deposition, shelf retrogradation
   dominated in the Campos Basin, whereas shelf progradation occurred in
   the Santos Basin. In the Tertiary, these basin fill styles were
   reversed: since the Paleogene, shelf progradation in the Campos Basin
   contrasts with overall retrogradation in the Santos Basin. In contrast,
   long-term Cretaceous Paleogene shelf retrogradation and intense Neogene
   progradation characterize the Pelotas Basin. Its specific basin fill and
   architecture mainly resulted from the absence of salt deposition and
   deformation. These temporally and spatially varying successions were
   controlled by specific long-term subsidence/uplift trends. Onshore and
   offshore tectonism in the Campos and Santos basins affected the sediment
   flux history, distribution of the main depocenters and occurrence of
   hydrocarbon stratigraphic structural traps. This is highlighted by the
   exhumation and erosion of the Serra do Mar, Serra da Mantiqueira and
   Ponta Grossa Arch in the hinterland, as well as salt tectonics in the
   offshore domain. The Pelotas Basin was less affected by changes in
   structural regimes until the Eocene, when the Andean orogeny caused
   uplift of the source areas. Flexural loading largely controlled its
   development and potential hydrocarbon traps are mainly stratigraphic.

Abstract = {{Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA), the most severe inherited retinal
   dystrophy, is genetically heterogeneous, with 14 genes accounting for
   70\% of patients. Here, 91 LCA probands underwent LCA chip analysis and
   subsequent sequencing of 6 genes (CEP290, CRB1, RPE65, GUCY2D, AIPL1 and
   CRX), revealing mutations in 69\% of the cohort, with major involvement
   of CEP290 (30\%). In addition, 11 patients with early-onset retinal
   dystrophy (EORD) and 13 patients with Senior-Loken syndrome (SLS),
   LCA-Joubert syndrome (LCA-JS) or cerebello-oculo-renal syndrome (CORS)
   were included. Exhaustive re-inspection of the overall phenotypes in our
   LCA cohort revealed novel insights mainly regarding the CEP290-related
   phenotype. The AHI1 gene was screened as a candidate modifier gene in
   three patients with the same CEP290 genotype but different neurological
   involvement. Interestingly, a heterozygous novel AHI1 mutation, p.
   Asn811Lys, was found in the most severely affected patient. Moreover,
   AHI1 screening in five other patients with CEP290-related disease and
   neurological involvement revealed a second novel missense variant,
   p.His758Pro, in one LCA patient with mild mental retardation and autism.
   These two AHI1 mutations might thus represent neurological modifiers of
   CEP290-related disease. c 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{1164-1179}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Two very promising wide-area voltage protection (V-WAP) solutions, able
   to face stability and security problems in the transmission grid, are
   presented. Both require real-time effective risk indicators whose timely
   computing is a crucial issue. The first method makes use of a voltage
   instability index based on real-time computing of the Thevenin
   equivalent circuit seen by a given high voltage (HV) bus. The innovating
   algorithm utilised for the real-time adaptive identification of the
   Thevenin voltage and impedance equivalent values requires local phasor
   measurements at fast sampling rate. The unique ability of the second
   method is mainly because of an effective coordination with a supposed
   operating wide-area voltage regulation (V-WAR) modern system where the
   secondary and tertiary voltage regulations (SVR and TVR, respectively)
   operate according to their hierarchies. Evidence for the feasibility and
   simplicity in defining and developing an effective V-WAP solution once
   reliable real-time risk indicators are available is provided. The
   feasibility of the first method comes from the high computing speed of
   the local risk indicator at each area bus where a phasor measurement
   unit (PMU) is installed. The main simplification of the second method
   comes from the already existing and appropriate subdivision of the
   network into areas provided by the operating SVR, the same areas as
   those of the protection scheme intervention. From this starting point, a
   voltage stability index is proposed operating the area load shedding
   (LS) according to a simple and incontrovertible logic based on the
   real-time area control effort. Dynamic simulation results on the North
   Italy power system show the proposed protection scheme's effectiveness
   and ability to achieve the continuity and stability of the controlled
   power system in front of a ramping load increase, by also containing the
   LS amount.}},

Abstract = {{The addition of K-lactate has been proposed as a NaCl substitute in
   dry-cured meat products. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   effect of K-lactate as NaCl substitute in meat with different pH on the
   ion uptakes of meat during the brine-salting process and on the ion
   diffusivities within meat at 2 degrees C and 12 degrees C after the
   salting process. The addition of K-lactate did not modify the chloride
   uptake and tended to reduce the sodium uptake, which was partially
   compensated by a higher potassium uptake.
   No interference caused by the lactate ion on the diffusivity of the
   chloride was observed. Meat pH significantly affected the ion uptake but
   did not significantly affect the post-salting ion diffusivities (D).
   Although the ion D values were of the same order, the D of lactate was
   significantly lower than that of the rest of the ions. Moreover, the
   post-salting temperature applied and the muscle type had a significant
   effect on ion diffusivities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pawpaw {[}Asimina triloba (L.) Dunal] is a tree fruit native to the
   Eastern United States with increasing popularity as a high-value niche
   crop. Two undesirable characteristics of pawpaw are great variation in
   fruit size and short shelf-life, caused in part by a small tear in the
   skin created when fruit are harvested from the cluster, allowing
   pathogens to enter the fruit. Within-cluster thinning of pawpaw to one
   fruit could increase fruit size and improve shelf-life by allowing the
   peduncle to be cut at harvest, maintaining an intact epidermis. The
   objectives of this study were to determine if hand thinning of
   multi-fruit clusters to one fruit could be accomplished without causing
   abortion of the remaining fruit and to determine if within-cluster
   thinning would increase average fruit size. In a preliminary experiment
   with seedling trees in 2004, hand thinning of clusters to a single fruit
   did not lead to cluster abortion or greater drop rates than unthinned
   clusters. Mature trees of four pawpaw cultivars were utilized in a fruit
   thinning study in 2006 and 2008. Trees were hand thinned in early-June,
   and fruit were harvested from mid-August through late-September. Fruit
   from hand-thinned trees weighed significantly more than those from
   control trees (47\% and 23\% greater weight in 2006 and 2008,
   respectively). Crop density, yield efficiency, and fruit number per tree
   tended to be or were significantly higher for unthinned trees. Number of
   clusters per tree, trunk cross-sectional area, yield, and the percent
   cluster drop and fruit drop, were not significantly different for
   thinned and unthinned trees. In pawpaw, as in other tree fruits, fruit
   thinning increases fruit size by reducing competition among and within
   clusters.}},

Abstract = {{Matrix gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) protein (MGP) is an important local
   inhibitor of vascular calcification, which can undergo two
   post-translational modifications: vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamate
   carboxylation and serine phosphorylation. While carboxylation is thought
   to have effects upon binding of calcium-ions, phosphorylation is
   supposed to affect the cellular release of MGP. Since both modifications
   can be exerted incompletely, various MGP species can be detected in the
   circulation. MGP levels were measured with two commercially available
   competitive and two novel sandwich assays in healthy controls, in
   patients with rheumatic disease, aortic valve disease, and end-stage
   renal disease, as well as in volunteers after vitamin K supplementation
   (VKS) and treatment with vitamin K antagonists (VKA). Major differences
   were found between the MGP assays, including significantly different
   behaviour with regard to vascular disease and the response to VKA and
   VKS. The dual-antibody assay measuring non-phosphorylated,
   non-carboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) was particularly sensitive for these
   changes and would be suited to assess the vascular vitamin K status. We
   conclude that the different assays for particular circulating MGP
   species allows the assessment of various aspects of the MGP system.}},

Abstract = {{A 400-year sediment record from an 18 m deep scour hole lake
   (Haarsteegse Wiel) near the Meuse River in the Netherlands was
   investigated for past changes in water quality, flooding frequency and
   landscape change using geophysical, geochemical and micropaleontological
   information. The results are highly significant for determining
   long-term trends of water quality, the impact of atmospheric (as SCP,
   spheroidal carbonaceous particles) and industrial (chromium) pollution
   on the terrestrial and aquatic flora, and the impact of river floods.
   The studied sediment record was dated by combining Cs-137 activities,
   biostratigraphical ages, micro-tephra layers, and historically
   documented floods indicated by the magnetic susceptibility. The oldest
   flooding event is indicated at AD 1610 when the lake was created by
   water masses bursting through a dike. Large historical river floods are
   well documented in regional chronicles and thus may provide reliable age
   calibration points. Based on assumptions about the timing of flood
   events and constant rate of sedimentation, it appears that sedimentation
   rates in Haarsteegse Wiel declined after ca. AD 1880. This decline might
   be a result of a widespread change from wheat cultivation to pasture
   land from around AD 1875 as a direct result of falling wheat prices and
   intensified cattle farming linked to the agricultural crisis in the last
   quarter of the nineteenth century. Water quality changes and absolute
   phosphorus concentrations were reconstructed using a diatom-based
   transfer function. Results show that the currently nutrient-rich lake
   has mostly been in a mesotrophic state prior to ca. AD 1920, with the
   exception of several apparently sharp eutrophication events that were
   coeval with river floods. River flooding also impacted the vegetation
   composition by importing allochthonous components, and indirectly by the
   influx of nutrients which had a clear influence on the composition of
   the water plant communities and aquatic species diversity. Magnetic
   susceptibility changes and pollen data show that within the period AD
   1610-1740, within the Little Ice Age period, several undocumented floods
   may have occurred. Thus, documentation of geophysical, geochemical, and
   biological flooding signals in a high-resolution archive present the
   possibility to detect flooding regimes further back in time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a CMOS implementation of a Linear Voltage Regulator
   (LVR) used to power an implanted physiological signal system that is
   used to monitor the blood pressure. The topology is based on a classical
   structure of a Low Dropout Regulator (LDO) and receives his activation
   energy from a RF link characterizing a passive RFID tag. The LVR was
   designed to achieve important features like low power consumption, and a
   small silicon area without the need for any external discrete
   components. The low power operation represents an essential condition to
   avoid a high energy RF link, thus minimizing the power of the
   transmitter and the thermal effects on the patient tissues. The project
   was diffused in a 0.35 mu m CMOS TSMC technology and a prototype was
   tested to validate the overall performance. The LVR output is regulated
   at 1 V and supplies a maximum load current of 0.5 mA @ 37 degrees C. The
   load regulation is 13 mV/mA and the line regulation is 39 mV/V. The LVR
   total power consumption is 1.2 mW.}},

Abstract = {{In parallel to studies of various cases of synesthesia, many cross-modal
   correspondences have also been documented in nonsynesthetes. Among these
   correspondences, implicit associations between taste and pitch have been
   reported recently (Crisinel \& Spence, 2009, 2010). Here, we replicate
   and extend these findings through explicit matching of sounds of varying
   pitch to a range of tastes/flavors. In addition, participants in the
   experiment reported here also chose the type of musical instrument most
   appropriate for each taste/flavor. The association of sweet and sour
   tastes to high-pitched notes was confirmed. By contrast, umami and
   bitter tastes were preferentially matched to low-pitched notes. Flavors
   did not display such strong pitch associations. The choice of musical
   instrument seems to have been driven primarily by a matching of the
   hedonic value and familiarity of the two types of stimuli. Our results
   raise important questions about our representation of tastes and flavors
   and could also lead to applications in the marketing of food products.}},

Abstract = {{We use the aerodynamic levitation technique combined with CO2 laser
   heating to study the structure of liquid calcium aluminates using
   neutron diffraction. We determine the structure factors and
   corresponding pair correlation functions describing the short-range
   order in the liquids above the melting points. The combination of the
   experiments with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations makes possible
   to get a detailed description of the liquid structure. We find that
   ordered tetrahedral sites around the Al atoms become more prevalent with
   increasing CaO concentration, while the Ca atoms present highly
   distorted environments at all compositions studied. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Control of emerging infectious diseases often hinges on identifying a
   pathogen reservoir, the source of disease transmission. The potential to
   function as a pathogen reservoir can be influenced by host lifespan,
   geographic provenance and phylogeny. Yet, no study has identified
   factors that causally determine the reservoir potential of diverse host
   species. We propose the host physiological phenotype hypothesis, which
   predicts that hosts with short-lived, poorly defended, nutrient rich and
   high metabolism tissue have greater values for three epidemiological
   parameters that determine reservoir potential: host susceptibility to
   infection, competence to infect vectors and ability to support vector
   populations. We experimentally tested these predictions using a
   generalist vectored virus and six wild grass species. Host physiological
   phenotype explained why hosts differed in all three epidemiological
   parameters while host lifespan, provenance and phylogeny could not
   explain host competence. Thus, a single, general axis describing
   variation in host physiological phenotype may explain reservoir
   potential.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Bleeding is a major cause of morbidity in recipients of
   continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVAD). A better
   understanding of the impact of CF-LVAD support on the hemostatic profile
   is necessary to establish better strategies for anticoagulation therapy
   and risk assessment for bleeding complications. A prospective
   multicenter study was conducted to characterize von Willebrand factor
   (vWF) profiles in patients undergoing CF-LVAD implantation.
   Methods. Blood samples were collected before and after CF-LVAD
   implantation from 37 patients between July 2008 and April 2009 at Duke
   University and the University of Minnesota. Blood samples were analyzed
   for vWF, platelet and collagen-binding ability. The presence of
   high-molecular-weight (HMW) vWF multimers were detected through gel
   electrophoresis, and deficiency was graded on a scale of 0 (normal) to 3
   (severe loss).
   Results. All 37 patients exhibited significant loss of HMW vWF multimers
   within 30 days of CF-LVAD implantation. Ten of the 37 patients
   experienced bleeding complications after CF-LVAD placement.
   Conclusions. All CF-LVAD recipients had acquired von Willebrand syndrome
   after LVAD placement, demonstrated by reduced or absent HMW vWF multimer
   levels. However, not all recipients had bleeding complications. These
   findings suggest that loss of HMW vWF multimers alone cannot predict
   bleeding risk. Further refinement of laboratory techniques and a larger
   follow-up is required to identify risk factors for bleeding in CF-LVAD
   recipients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Previous research has suggested that fruits and vegetables
   are more expensive and less readily available in more deprived
   communities. However, this evidence is mainly based on small samples
   drawn from specific communities often located in urban settings and thus
   is not generalisable to national contexts. The present study explores
   the influence of neighbourhood deprivation and local retail structure on
   the price and availability of fruit and vegetables in a sample of areas
   representing the diversity of urban-rural environments across Scotland,
   UK.
   Methods: A sample of 310 stores located in 10 diverse areas of Scotland
   was surveyed and data on the price and availability of a basket of 15
   fruit and vegetable items were collected. The data were analysed to
   identify the influence of store type and neighbourhood deprivation on
   the price and availability of fruits and vegetables.
   Results: Neighbourhood deprivation and store type did not significantly
   predict the price of a basket of fruit and vegetables within the sample,
   although baskets did decrease in price as store size increased. The
   highest prices were found in the smallest stores located in the most
   deprived areas. Availability of fruit and vegetables is lower in small
   shops located within deprived neighbourhoods compared to similar shops
   in affluent areas. Overall, availability increases with increasing store
   size.
   Conclusions: Availability of fruit and vegetables significantly varies
   by neighbourhood deprivation in small stores. Policies aimed at
   promoting sales of fruit and vegetable in these outlets may benefit
   residents in deprived areas.}},

Abstract = {{Belted kingfisher (Ceryle alcyon), spotted sandpiper (Actin's
   macularia), and tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) eggs were collected
   in 2004 from the upper Hudson River, New York, USA. This area is one of
   the most polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)contaminated locations in North
   America. Multivariate analyses indicated among species differences in
   the concentration and composition of PCB congeners, polychlorinated
   dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD), and dibenzofuran (PCDF, PCDD-F when combined
   with PCDDs) congeners, and chlorinated pesticides. Total PCB
   concentrations followed the typical food chain biomagnification paradigm
   of higher concentrations in piscivorous bird eggs and lower
   concentrations in eggs of species that feed at lower trophic levels.
   Concentrations in the insectivorous swallows (geometric mean = 6.8 mu
   g/g wet wt) were approximately half the concentrations present in the
   piscivorous kingfisher (11.7 mu g/g) or omnivorous sandpiper (12.6 mu
   g/g). In contrast, PCB toxic equivalents (TEQs) were higher in swallows
   (1,790 pg/g wet wt) than in either kingfishers (776 pg/g) or sandpipers
   (881 pg/g). This difference can be mainly attributed to higher PCB77
   concentrations in swallows relative to the other two species. Also
   contrary to the accepted food-chain paradigm, the sum of PCDD-F
   concentrations and the sum of their TEQs were higher in swallows than in
   either sandpipers or kingfishers. Metabolic pathway differences in the
   respective food chains of the three species probably accounted for the
   differences observed in PCB TEQ, total PCDD-F, and PCDD-F TEQ
   concentrations among species. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010;29:2286-2296.

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to verify if there are differences in the
   amplitude of signals from surface electromyography (EMG) during maximal
   and submaximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC and 50\% MVC,
   respectively) under different conditions, in our case, water and air,
   with and without extra protection (water-resistant tape) on the
   electrode. The isometric force and muscle activation of the MVC and 50\%
   MVC of the biceps brachial muscle of nine healthy trained men were
   measured simultaneously, performed in water and on air, with and without
   protection of the EMG electrode. The multivariate analysis of variance
   with a post hoc Tukey test was applied to detect significant differences
   between the levels of muscular force. For the amplitude values of the
   EMG signal, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied to compare all
   experimental conditions in order to detect a significance of p < 0.05.
   The values of isometric force were not significantly different among
   conditions (MVC and 50\% MVC). The results showed a significant
   difference among conditions in the water without extra protection
   compared to the conditions on air with and without extra protection and
   in water with extra protection. Reduced EMG amplitude was seen in water
   without extra protection from 37.04\% to 55.81\% regarding the other
   conditions. However, no significant difference was seen among conditions
   in water with extra protection in relation the conditions on air (with
   and without extra protection). This study suggest that it is necessary
   to use a water-resistant tape as an extra protection on the electrode
   when using EMG underwater, to avoid having a significant decrease in the
   EMG amplitude underwater and not to suffer interference from the water.
   There was no significant difference among the recordings of EMG with and
   without the use of protection on air; therefore, the protection does not
   influence the recording of EMG amplitude and isometric force on air. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective. - The purpose of the present study was to compare how many
   inflate and deflate are necessary to maintain the endotracheal tube cuff
   pressure between 15 and 35 cm H(2)O by using air, O(2)-N(2)O mix or
   saline solution.
   Study design. - Randomized and prospective study.
   Patients and methods. - Ninety children from 1 month to 15 years of age
   were included in the study. All patients were ventilated with
   O(2)50\%-N(2)O50\%. Subsequently, the patients were divided in three
   groups: (1) Group 1: patients with air inflated cuffs; (2) Group 2:
   patients with O(2)-N(2)O mix inflated cuffs; (3) Group 3: patients with
   saline solution inflated cuffs. In all groups cuffs were inflated to
   reach an intracuff pressure of 20 cmH(2)O. The cuff pressure was then
   monitored every 10 minutes and adjusted to be between 15 and 35 cmH(2)O.
   Laryngeal and tracheal symptoms were noted in the recovery room.
   Results. - The three groups of patients were similar for age, weight,
   and sex. The length of surgery was significantly longer in Group 3. The
   deflate rate was higher in Group 1 (60\%) than in Group 2 (10\%) or 3
   (3.3\%) (p < 0.0001). The inflate rate was higher in Group 2 (76.6\%)
   than in Group 1 or 3 (both 3.3\%) (p < 0.0001). Side effects were
   comparable in the three groups of patients.
   Conclusion. - Using air or O(2)-N(2)O mix to inflate cuffs is not
   reliable. SSI helps to maintain a more stable cuff pressure but
   monitoring is difficult and sometimes contraindicated by tracheal tubes
   producers. Inflating cuffs with air and regularly monitoring pressure is
   the most reliable and easiest technique. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract = {{Solid dispersion tablets prepared by either spray drying or
   rotoevaporation and exhibiting different grain and pore sizes were
   investigated under the process of hydration-swelling-gelation. H-2 and
   H-1 NMR microimaging experiments were used to selectively follow water
   penetration and polymer mobilization kinetics, respectively, while the
   drug release kinetics was followed by H-1 NMR spectroscopy. The obtained
   data, in combination with morphological information by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), reveal a complex process that ultimately leads to
   release of the drug into the aqueous phase. We find that the rate of
   water ingress has no direct influence on release kinetics, which also
   renders air in the tablets a secondary factor. On the other hand, drug
   release is directly correlated with the polymer mobilization kinetics.
   Water diffusion into the originally dry polymer grains determines the
   rate of grain swelling and the hydration within the grains varies
   strongly with grain size. We propose that this sets the stage for
   creating homogeneous gels for small grain sizes and heterogeneous gels
   for large grain sizes. Fast diffusion through water-rich sections of the
   inhomogeneous gels that exhibit a large mesh size is the factor which
   yields a faster drug release from tablets prepared by rotoevaporation.

   form isotherm, and the bio-chemical degradation process was assumed to
   follow the Monod kinetics The mathematical model was descretized by the
   finite element numerical method In the pot test, the hydraulic loading
   was assumed to have the intermittent pattern simulating the rainfall
   duration and the occurrence of frequency, and the concentrations of
   pollutants in the influent and effluent were measured The computed
   overall removal rates for the CODCr and TN in lour cases are in the
   range of 90 62\% - 95 43\% and 85 01\% - 96 46\%, respectively The
   differences between the computed and tested overall removal rates for
   the CODCr, and TN are smaller than 5\% The time-varying oscillation
   pattern of the concentrations of the CODCr and TINE were rationally
   simulated which showed that the model presented in this article could be
   used to assess the pollutant removal efficiency of the soil and plants

Title = {{Plastic dissipation energy at a bimaterial crack tip under cyclic

Abstract = {{A theory has been introduced that relates the fatigue crack growth rate
   to the total plastic energy dissipated ahead of a crack tip under cyclic
   loading. Due to advances in computational efficiency, the reversed
   plastic zone can now be resolved adequately using the finite element
   method. The authors have previously published results for the plastic
   dissipation energy for cracks in homogeneous materials under mixed mode
   I and II loading. The purpose of the current research is to expand that
   set of results to include interface cracks in a general layered
   material. Applications of crack growth along a bimaterial interface
   include soldering, layered manufacturing, thermal spray coating,
   welding, brazing, or any other process that deposits a material onto a
   substrate where often it is more energetically favorable for a crack to
   grow along the interface than to propagate into either of the contiguous
   materials. Results of the plastic dissipation energy are obtained using
   2-D elastic-plastic plane strain finite element analysis of a sharp
   crack along a bimaterial interface. Results show the plastic dissipation
   energy is proportional to the square of the strain energy release rate.
   By normalizing the results for the plastic dissipation with respect to
   the loads and material properties, it can be seen that the plastic
   dissipation energy has the greatest dependence on the mode mix ratio,
   followed by elastic and plastic property mismatches, respectively.
   Furthermore, a definition of the mode mix ratio based on dissipated
   energy is presented, which provides physical motivation for the
   characteristic length parameter needed to quantify the mode mix along a
   bimaterial interface. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Influence of rearing and experimental temperatures on predator avoidance
   behaviour in a freshwater pulmonate snail}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2107-2113}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Predicted increases in the temperature of freshwaters is likely to
   affect how prey species respond to predators. We investigated how the
   predator avoidance behaviour of the freshwater pulmonate snail Lymnaea
   stagnalis is influenced by the temperature at which it was reared and
   that at which behavioural trials were carried out.
   2. Crawl-out behaviour of juvenile snails from two populations (high
   predation risk versus low predation risk) reared at either 15 or 20
   degrees C was assessed in response to predation cues (predatory fish
   kairomones and conspecific alarm cues) in behavioural trials at both 15
   and 20 degrees C.
   3. Trial temperature had a significant effect on the time that snails
   spent in avoidance, regardless of their population of origin. Crawl-out
   behaviour was greater during behavioural trials at 15 degrees C, but
   there was no effect of trial temperature on the speed with which animals
   showed avoidance behaviour.
   4. There was no interactive effect of rearing temperature (RT) and trial
   temperature, but the effect of RT on avoidance behaviour did differ
   between populations. For an RT of 15 degrees C, snails from the South
   Drain (high risk) population showed a more rapid and longer avoidance
   response than those from the Chilton Moor (low risk) population. In
   contrast, for snails reared at 20 degrees C, there was no difference
   between populations for the duration of the avoidance response and
   snails from Chilton Moor crawled out faster than those from South Drain.
   5. Hence, whilst (predictable) differences relative to natural predation
   threat in crawl-out behaviour were apparent at 15 degrees C, raising the
   developmental temperature to 20 degrees C eliminated or, in the case of
   latency, reversed these differences. This suggests that L. stagnalis
   populations that cohabit with predatory fish and experience high
   developmental temperatures may have a reduced ability to respond to fish
   predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{For a shape-regular triangulation T-h without obtuse angles of a bounded

   functions linear on the triangles from T-h and Pi(h) the interpolation
   operator from C((Omega) over bar) to L-h. This paper is devoted to the
   following classical problem: Find a second-order approximation of the
   derivative partial derivative u/partial derivative z(a) in a direction z
   of a function u epsilon C-3((Omega) over bar) in a vertex a in the form
   of a linear combination of the constant directional derivatives partial
   derivative Pi(h)(u)/partial derivative z on the triangles surrounding a.
   An effective procedure for such an approximation is presented, its error
   is proved to be of the size O(h(2)), an operator W-h : L-h -> L-h x L-h
   relating a second-order approximation W-h{[}Pi(h)(u)] of del u to every
   u epsilon C-3((Omega) over bar) is constructed and shown to be a
   so-called recovery operator. The accuracy of the presented approximation
   is compared with the accuracies of the local approximations by other

Abstract = {{Sedimentary charcoal records document changes in fire regime. We have
   identified 67 sites (30 sites with better than millennial resolution)
   which have records for some part of the Last Glacial to analyse changes
   in global fire regimes. Fire was consistently lower during the glacial
   than during the Eemian and Holocene. Within the glacial, Marine Isotope
   Stage (MIS) 3 is characterised globally by more fire than MIS 2. The
   signal for MIS 4 is less clear: there is more fire in the Northern
   Hemisphere and less fire in the Southern Hemisphere than during MIS 2
   and 3. The records, most particularly records from the northern
   extratropics, show millennial-scale variability in fire regimes
   corresponding to the rapid climate changes associated with
   Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles. Most of the D-O cycles during the Last
   Glacial and all of the Heinrich stadials are apparent in the composite
   global record of fire regime: fire increases during D-O warming events
   and decreases during intervals of rapid cooling. Our analyses show that
   fire regimes show a lagged response to rapid climate changes of ca
   100-200 years in the case of D-O warming events, ca 0-100 years in the
   case of D-O cooling events and ca 200 years in the case of Heinrich
   Stadials. The Strong climatic variability experienced during the glacial
   resulted in important changes in fire regimes even though the base level
   of biomass burning was less than today. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{First metatarsophalangeal joint replacement is an alternative surgical
   procedure to arthrodesis in the treatment of moderate-to-severe hallux
   rigidus. However, few studies have been published about functional
   outcome after joint reconstructive procedures for hallux rigidus. The
   purpose of this study was to assess clinical, radiological and
   functional outcome, with special regard to recreational and sports
   activity, after first metatarsophalangeal joint replacement in patients
   affected by hallux rigidus grade III. Twenty-three patients who had
   undergone total joint replacement of the first metatarsophalangeal joint
   were examined preoperatively and three, six, 12 and 18 months
   postoperatively. All patients (mean age of 57.0 +/- 3.7 years) received
   a non-cemented TOEFIT-PLUS (TM) implant by one surgeon. Clinical scores
   (AOFAS score and VAS), radiological examination, patient satisfaction
   and sport participation were used to evaluate treatment outcome and
   radiolucent lines. The mean AOFAS score showed a significant improvement
   from 44.6 +/- 7.2 points preoperatively to an average of 82.5 +/- 14.4
   points at last follow-up (p < 0.001). The mean total ROM of the first
   MTP joint increased from 28.1 +/- 4.9 degrees preoperatively to 52.7 +/-
   15.7 degrees postoperatively (p < 0.001). After surgery, 91.3\% of the
   patients were able to resume at least one recreational activity. Total
   arthroplasty for the treatment of hallux rigidus in an active patient
   population revealed good clinical and functional results. However,
   postoperative recreational sport activity showed a decrease in
   comparison to the pre-arthritic state. Further follow-up is necessary to
   quantify loosening risk in active patients after total hallux
   arthroplasty.}},

   instruction on the electron transport chain. The data were analyzed with
   a repeated measures general linear model. Mental models progressed
   significantly for both strategies (p < .001), and a significant
   interaction was found between cognitive flexibility and instructional
   strategy on mental model progression (p = .02). The segmented strategy
   was superior for learners with higher cognitive flexibility but inferior
   to the holistic strategy for lower cognitive flexibility learners.
   Results have important implications for differentiating instruction on

Abstract = {{The allocation of central government funds is a critical element in the
   equitable provision of local authority-commissioned and -provided
   services. A variety of approaches to allocating funding for social
   services for older people have been used over the years, most recently
   founded on `needs-based' formulae. In 2004, the Department of Health for
   England commissioned research to help inform the improvement and
   updating of the formula. The results of individual-level analyses were
   compared with the results obtained from analyses of small area
   (ward-level) data on service users. Both analyses were affected by
   problems of data availability, particularly the individual-level
   analysis, and the Department of Health and the (then) Office of the
   Deputy Prime Minister decided that the formula calculations should be
   based on the results of the small area analysis. However, despite the
   differences in approach, both methods produced very similar results. The
   correlation between the predicted relative needs weights for local
   authorities from the two models was 0.982. The article discusses the
   strengths and weaknesses of each approach and developments that could
   allow a normative approach that would incorporate future policy
   objectives into formulae that, to date, have inevitably been based on
   historical data and service patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To describe duplex ultrasound (DUS) outcomes 12 months
   following ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) of primary great
   saphenous varicose veins (GSVV).
   Methods: A consecutive series of UK National Health Service patients
   underwent serial DUS examinations following UGFS with 3\% sodium
   tetradecyl sulphate for symptomatic primary GSVV.
   Results: 344 treated legs (CEAP C-2/3 237, C-4 72, C-5 14, C-6 21)
   belonging to 278 patients (103 male) of median age 57 (range 21-89)
   years were enrolled between November 2004 and May 2007. The median
   volume of foam used was 10 (range 2-16) ml. Above-knee (AK) and
   below-knee (BK) GSV reflux was present in 333 (96.8\%) and 308 (89.5\%)
   legs respectively prior to treatment. AK and BK-GSV reflux was
   completely eradicated by a single session of UGFS in 323 (97.0\%) and
   294 (95.5\%) legs respectively; and by two sessions of UGFS in 329
   (98.8\%) and 304 (98.7\%) legs respectively. In those legs where GSV
   reflux had been eradicated, recanalisation occurred in 18/286 (6.3\%) AK
   and 23/259 (8.9\%) BK-GSV segments after 12 months follow-up.
   Conclusions: A single session of UGFS can eradicate reflux in the AK and
   BK-GSV in over 95\% of patients with symptomatic primary GSVV.
   Recanalisation at 12 months is superior to that reported after surgery
   and similar to that observed following other minimally invasive
   techniques. (C) 2010 European Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by

   second, oven dried, powdered with liquid nitrogen, and preserved in deep
   freezer at 0C (+/- 1C) in different small airtight sterilized vials
   labelled as laboratory processed samples (LPS). In both samples,
   soluble, reducing and nonreducing sugars, amino acids, proteins, lipids,

Abstract = {{Modulation of the inflammatory response has become a key focal point in
   the treatment of critically ill patients. Much of the computational work
   in this emerging field has been carried out with the goal of unraveling
   the primary drivers, interconnections, and dynamics of systemic
   inflammation. To translate these theoretical efforts into clinical
   approaches, the proper biological targets and specific manipulations
   must be identified. In this work, we pursue this goal by implementing a
   nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithm in the context of a
   reduced computational model of the acute inflammatory response to severe
   infection. In our simulations, NMPC successfully identifies
   patient-specific therapeutic strategies, based on simulated observations
   of clinically accessible inflammatory mediators, which outperform
   standardized therapies, even when the latter are derived using a general
   optimization routine. These results imply that a combination of
   computational modeling and NMPC may be of practical use in suggesting
   novel immuno-modulatory strategies for the treatment of intensive care
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the assumed positive
   association of pre-existent and pregnancy-induced hypertension with the
   offspring's weight and length gain in the first 14 months of life. We
   studied 3994 pregnant women and their offspring in a prospective
   community-based cohort study, starting between 2003 and 2004 (Amsterdam
   Born Children and their Development, ABCD study). Questionnaires
   obtaining information about hypertension during pregnancy were
   completed, and this was complemented with additional information from
   the obstetric caregiver. Anthropometry of the offspring was followed
   during the first 14 months of life. Main outcome measures were presence
   or absence of growth acceleration in weight or length (normal: Delta SDS
   <= 0.67 v. growth acceleration: Delta SDS > 0.67). The relation between
   hypertension during pregnancy and weight and length gain was addressed
   by logistic regression analyses. We found that pre-existent hypertension
   was related to growth acceleration in weight and length. After
   correction for birth weight and pregnancy duration, the effect remained
   significant for growth acceleration in weight (OR 1.89; 95\% CI
   1.21-2.97; P < 0.01). Pregnancy-induced hypertension showed similar
   results, although correction for birth weight and pregnancy duration
   rendered the associations non-significant. In conclusion, infants of
   women with pre-existent hypertension during pregnancy more frequently
   have growth acceleration in weight and length, and yet the mechanisms
   acting on postnatal growth appear to be different.}},

Title = {{Impactor flux and cratering on the Pluto-Charon system}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{521}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Aims. We study the impactor flux and cratering on Pluto and Charon
   caused by the collisional evolution of Plutinos. Plutinos are
   trans-Neptunian objects located at similar to 39.5 AU, in the 3: 2 mean
   motion resonance with Neptune.
   Methods. We develop a statistical code that includes catastrophic
   collisions and cratering events, and takes into account the stability
   and instability zones of the 3: 2 mean motion resonance with Neptune.
   Our numerical algorithm proposes different initial populations that
   account for the uncertainty in the size distribution of Plutinos at
   small sizes.
   Results. Depending on the initial population, our results indicate the
   following. The number of D > 1 km Plutinos streaking Pluto over 3.5 Gyr
   is between 1271 and 5552. For Charon, the number of D > 1 km Plutino
   impactors is between 354 and 1545. The number of D > 1 km craters on
   Pluto produced by Plutinos in the past 3.5 Gyr is between 43 076 and 113
   879. For Charon, the number of D > 1 km craters is between 20 351 and 50
   688. On the other hand, the largest Plutino impactor onto Pluto has a
   diameter of between similar to 17 and 23 km, which produces a crater
   with a diameter of similar to 31-39 km. In the same way, the largest
   Plutino impactor onto Charon has a diameter of between similar to 10 and
   15 km, which produces a crater with a diameter of similar to 24-33 km.
   Finally, we test the dependence of results on the number of Pluto-sized
   objects in the Plutino population. If two Pluto-sized objects are
   assumed in the 3: 2 Neptune resonance, the total number of Plutino
   impactors onto both Pluto and Charon with diameters D > 1 km is a factor
   of similar to 1.6-1.8 larger than that obtained considering only one
   Pluto-sized object in this resonant region.
   Conclusions. Given the structure of the trans-Neptunian region, with its
   dynamically different populations, it is necessary to study in detail
   the contribution of all the potential sources of impactors onto the
   Pluto-Charon system, to determine the main contributor and the whole
   production of craters. Then, we will be able to contrast those studies
   with observations, which will help us to understand the geological
   processes and history of the surface of those worlds.}},

Abstract = {{Examples of small self-cleaving RNAs embedded in noncoding regions

   show the widespread occurrence of the hammerhead ribozyme (HHR) motif
   among genomes from the Bacteria, Chromalveolata, Plantae, and Metazoa
   kingdoms. Intergenic HHRs were detected in three different bacterial
   genomes, whereas metagenomic data from Galapagos Islands showed the
   occurrence of similar ribozymes that could be regarded as direct relics
   from the RNA world. Among eukaryotes, HHRs were detected in the genomes
   of three water molds as well as 20 plant species, ranging from
   unicellular algae to vascular plants. These HHRs were very similar to
   those previously described in small RNA plant pathogens and, in some
   cases, appeared as close tandem repetitions. A parallel situation of
   tandemly repeated HHR motifs was also detected in the genomes of lower
   metazoans from cnidarians to invertebrates, with special emphasis among
   hematophagous and parasitic organisms. Altogether, these findings unveil
   the HHR as a widespread motif in DNA genomes, which would be involved in

Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the systemic
   mercury levels in urine of patients and dental school students caused by
   exposure to silver amalgam. It is currently believed that occupational
   exposure shows the highest rate of potential for poisoning by mercury.
   Dental professionals are part of that quota, introducing concerns
   regarding the handling of dental amalgam. Materials and Methods: The
   study comprised 40 urine samples from 20 subjects, which were divided
   into four sampling groups: G1A (n = 10) composed of students before
   their first occupational contact; G1B (n = 10) composed of the same G1
   students after their first contact; G2A (n = 10) composed of patients
   who needed to have dental restorations before amalgam removal; and G2B
   (n = 10) composed of patients who needed to have dental restoration
   after amalgam removal. Cold-vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometry
   (CVAAS) was used as the evaluation method. Results: A statistically
   significant difference was found among dependent groups 1 and 2 (p =
   0.0038), whereas mercury levels increased considerably after the first
   occupational contact of all subjects. Conclusions: Occupational exposure
   to dental amalgam poses a potential risk of increasing systemic mercury
   levels, although urine mercury levels in all the sample participants
   were below the limits of biologic tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of a ``sacred landscape{''} cannot be identified either with
   that of a ``cultic landscape{''} (the integration of places devoted to
   worship within the diverse components of a landscape) nor with that of a
   ``sacred space{''} (the organization of a social space by the spreading
   and hierarchical ordering of worship sites). In order to understand its
   specific nature, it is necessary to examine the processes of symbolic
   spatial constructions based on a performance site, which has a religious
   dimension in its own right. The study of the representation of
   Eleutherai in Euripides' Antiope illustrates one of these processes,
   which creates a religious landscape between Athens and its margins.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. - The steady increase of the blood demand since 2001 requires
   to study the clinical characteristics of blood components recipients.
   The objective was to describe patients transfused in 2006 in Bordeaux
   University Hospital, and to identify the diseases which justified the
   transfusion practice, using French hospital claims database.
   Study design. - Data from haemovigilance system were linked to hospital
   claims databases in order to describe patients transfused in 2006. To
   target diseases related to transfusion, a list of diagnoses considered
   as markers for transfusion was drawn up, and validated by physicians
   prescribing blood components.
   Results. - Among the 100 004 patients admitted to hospital in 2006, 6275
   (6.3\%) received blood components; 46 727 blood units were transfused to
   these patients, including 67\% of red blood cell, 13\% of platelet
   concentrates and 20\% of fresh-frozen plasma; 69\% of blood units were
   prescribed in medical wards, 30\% in surgery wards and 1\% in
   gynaecology and obstetrics. The main diagnoses associated with blood
   transfusion were circulatory complications after cardiac surgery (80\%
   of patients with this diagnosis were transfused), bone marrow aplasia
   (76\% of patients), anaemia (55\%), and gastro-intestinal bleeding
   (48\%). The highest numbers of blood units were transfused to patients
   with hypovolemic, traumatic or postoperative shock, anaemia, hemopathy,
   or coagulation disorders.
   Conclusion. - This study provided a clinical profile of the transfused
   patients. Data collected could be used to plan blood collection and to
   define objectives and resources of healthcare establishments. (c) 2010

Abstract = {{This paper provides a critical analysis of the application of happiness
   research into policy domains. An overview of the current debate on the
   politics of happiness is elaborated by focusing on its promising
   perspectives as well as the potential problems it raises. Arguments of
   proponents and opponents are confronted with each other in discussing
   the following central issues in the debate: (1) the state of progress of
   the happiness research; (2) the value of happiness and its promotion by
   political means; (3) the possibility of promoting happiness; (4)
   paternalism versus autonomy and (5) a fair distribution of happiness. It
   is concluded from this that pragmatic issues do not pose insurmountable
   obstacles for the realization of a politics of happiness, although
   further research is definitely recommendable. The ideological or ethical
   issues however require further debate and research before the actual
   realization of a politics of happiness is possible. More specifically,
   the science of happiness needs to give more attention to analyzing the
   value of happiness and the desirability of increasing happiness by
   political means. Also the weighing of the value of happiness against
   other values and goals is an important issue to be put on the agenda.
   This paper thus explicates the moral choices and challenges that
   politicians would be confronted with if they want to put the increase of
   happiness on the political agenda.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the widespread use of molecular biology techniques, standardized
   methods for the measurement of HIV-1 proviral DNA are currently lacking
   and several discordant results are still present in different studies.
   To assess the clinical meaning of the proviral DNA load, a study group
   comprising seven different laboratories was set up to standardize a
   HIV-1 proviral DNA quantification method able to assess the DNA proviral
   load of the most relevant circulating HIV-1 subtypes. Reference samples
   (24 cellular samples infected with HIV-1 clade B, and 40 samples of
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells containing different concentrations
   of plasmids expressing different HIV-1 clades) were distributed and
   tested blindly All laboratories employed hTERT gene as housekeeping gene
   and primers within the gag gene to quantify different HIV-1 clades.
   Inter-laboratory results did not differ statistically but showed only
   minor variations concerning HIV-1 DNA amounts and different HIV clades,
   with a good agreement among the laboratories participating in the study
   Since test standardization represents a key step for future application
   in clinical practice, further studies of the patients' samples are in
   progress to establish the real meaning and utility of the proviral DNA
   load for clinical management of HIV-1 infected patients.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To show the mortality rate of children undergoing to Fontan
   operation and determine whether the hypoplastic left heart syndrome
   (HLHS) is a risk factor for hospital mortality.
   Methods: From August 2001 to June 2008, 76 patients underwent Fontan
   operation and were divided into two groups: group A with 54 patients, 31
   (40.7\%) patients with tricuspid atresia and variants, six (7.8\%) of
   double-inlet left ventricle, four (5.3\%) and atrioventricular septal
   defect and total 13 (17.1\%) of other complex congenital heart disease
   and group B all patients with HLHS a total of 22 (28.9\%) patients.
   Results: Group A patients had a mean age of 6.47 years +/- 4.83 and
   group B of 2.08 years +/- 0.24 P <0.001, the average weight was 22.42
   +/- 11.04 against 12.99 +/- 1.2 P = 0.016, the mean CPB time was 119.5
   min versus 113.3 min P = 0.0, with a mean clamping time of 74.8 min and
   73.5 min p = 0.75. The mean ICU stay was 4.1 days for group A versus
   7.52 days for group B p = 0.0003. In total (group A + B) three patients
   died, with hospital mortality of 3.9\%, and one patient with HLHS
   (4.54\%) (P <0.001, 95\% CI 0.001 to 0.228).
   Conclusion: Our study shows that despite higher morbidity in HLHS is not

Abstract = {{Genetic diversity of two Eucalyptus grandis nucleus populations. In
   genetic breeding of forest species, a base population or pre-selected
   higher individuals have a fundamental importance to program maintenance
   due to their better origins and large genetic basis, which continuously
   propitiates gains. The aim of this study was to verify the variability
   level in two Eucalyptus grandis nucleus populations. Thus, 39
   individuals were evaluated 19 in population 1, and 20 in population 2.
   Fourteen microsatellite primers were measured, identified and analyzed
   using GeneScan and Genotyper software through an ABI Prism 3100
   automatic sequencer. The number of alleles in each primer varied between
   5 and 15 in population 1, and from 8 to 18 in population 2.
   Heterozygosity was higher in population 2 - 0.869, versus 0.843 in
   population 1. Mean genetic distance among individuals was 0.6220 in
   population 1 and 0.6112 in population 2. After individual molecular
   characterization, a database was compiled to allow the control of these
   improvement programs in different selection cycles based on population
   genetic parameters.}},

Title = {{The dynamical ages of two low-luminosity young radio sources}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{521}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Context. Young radio-loud active galactic nuclei form an important tool
   for investigating the evolution of extragalactic radio sources. To study
   the early phases of expanding radio sources, we are using the CORALZ
   sample, which contains 25 compact (theta < 2 `') radio sources
   associated with nearby galaxies.
   Aims. In this paper we aim to determine the lobe-to-lobe expansion
   speeds for two sources in the sample. Comparing the dynamical ages of
   these relatively low-luminosity objects with ages of powerful sources
   found in the literature, will serve to test radio source evolution
   models.
   Methods. We present our third epoch of VLBI observations, using the
   EVN+VLBA array at 5.0 GHz, at four and eight years after our previous
   measurements.
   Results. We report the detection of a lobe-to-lobe expansion speed of
   0.095 +/- 0.020 h(-1) c for CORALZ J083139+460800, and a 1-sigma upper
   limit to the expansion speed of CORALZ J131739+411545 of 0.074 h(-1) c.
   The detected expansion speed of CORALZ J083139+460800 corresponds to a
   dynamical age of 245 +/- 55 years.
   Conclusions. The detected expansion speed and upper limit are lower than
   any presented in the literature for powerful young AGN. This confirms
   that the expansion speeds of young radio sources are correlated with
   their radio luminosities.}},

Abstract = {{In order to test the hypothesis that RNA structural elements promote the
   distribution of certain types of recombination junctions in each one of
   the 2C and 3D poliovirus genomic regions (Sabin 3/Sabin 2 or Sabin 1 in
   2C and Sabin 2/Sabin 1 or Sabin 3 in 3D), we searched in 2C and 3D
   regions of reference Sabin strains for high probability RNA structural
   elements that could promote recombination. Recombination junctions that
   were identified in clinical strains of this study, as well as in
   clinical strains of previous studies, were superimposed on RNA secondary
   structure models of 2C and 3D genomic regions. Furthermore, we created
   an in vitro model, based on double infection of cell-culture with two
   poliovirus strains, for the production and identification of recombinant
   Sabin strains in 2C and 3D regions. Our intention was to compare the
   results that refer to the correlation of recombination junctions and RNA
   secondary structures in 2C and 3D regions of clinical strains, with the
   respective results of the in vitro model. Most of the recombination
   junctions of the clinical strains were correlated with RNA secondary
   structure elements, which were identical between recombining Sabin
   strains, and also presented high predictive value. In consensus were,
   the respective results originated from the in vitro model. We propose
   that the distribution of specific types of recombination junctions in
   certain regions of Sabin strains is not fortuitous and is correlated
   with RNA secondary structure elements identical to both recombination
   partners. Furthermore, results of this study highlight an important role
   for the stem region of the RNA structure elements in promoting
   recombination.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical ventilation is a lifesaving treatment delivered to patients
   with a wide spectrum of medical and surgical diseases. However,
   significant limitations of the clinical application of mechanical
   ventilation in current practice have emerged, prompting the definition
   of novel therapeutic perspectives, especially concerning the prevention
   and treatment of acute respiratory failure. In the past few decades,
   there has been a consistent scientific and technologic effort to develop
   alternative strategies to avoid the need for mechanical ventilation. In
   particular, several studies have explored the feasibility and efficacy
   of extracorporeal oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal. Furthermore,
   promising results on the prevention of the occurrence of severe acute
   respiratory failure have been provided by clinical studies on the
   noninvasive application of continuous positive airway pressure as well
   as by experimental investigations in basic science. Therefore, further
   development in this direction will occur only with a permanent
   integration and exchange of knowledge among industry, clinicians, and
   scientific investigators. (Crit Care Med 2010; 38{[}Suppl.]:S555-S558)}},

Abstract = {{Forty non-demented older adults who were divided into two groups on the
   basis of their cognitive status (MCI: n=20; normal control: n=20)
   underwent diffusion tensor imaging, and estimates of fractional
   anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were obtained for the genu and
   splenium of the corpus callosum. Results demonstrated the following: (1)
   group comparisons revealed that splenium FA was significantly lower in
   MCI participants than in NC participants, despite no differences in
   gross morphometry or hippocampal volumes; (2) in the overall sample,
   higher stroke risk was associated with lower white matter integrity,
   particularly in the genu; (3) increased stroke risk was more strongly
   associated with poorer splenium FA in those with MCI than in normal
   elderly; (4) splenium FA significantly predicted performance on verbal
   memory (adjusting for the effects of age, education, and whole brain
   volume). Findings demonstrate a relationship between increased vascular
   burden and white matter changes, and they support the possibility that
   posterior white matter pathology may contribute to the development of
   MCI-related cognitive changes. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents the synthesis and characterization of L2 and L3,
   which formed with the previously described ligand L1 a family of three
   tris(tetraamine) ligands based on a mesitylenyl spacer. The trimeric
   ligands differ from one to the other by the nature of their tetraamine
   moieties: triethylene-tetraamine (L1), cyclen (L2), and constrained
   cyclen (L3) The impact of the rigidification of the structure from L1 to
   L3 on the acid-base properties is investigated, and the behavior of the
   ligands towards triphosphate (TriP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP),
   adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) anion
   receptors is explored by potentiometric investigations. To characterize
   and understand the driving forces implicated in the supramolecular
   assemblies, results are supported by H-1 and P-31 NMR measurements
   performed over a wide pH range. ATP appears as the most complexed anion
   and particular attention is given to comparison with its inorganic
   triphosphate analogue to highlight the contribution of pi-stacking
   interactions. Results unambiguously show the various coordination scheme
   induced by the structure of the ligands.}},

Abstract = {{Demyelination and axonal damage are pathologic hallmarks of multiple
   sclerosis (MS), leading to loss of neuronal synchronization, functional
   disconnection amongst brain relays, and clinical sequelae. To
   investigate these properties, the primary component of the sensorimotor
   network was analyzed in mildly disabled Relapsing-Remitting MS patients
   without sensory symptoms at the time of the investigation. By
   magnetoencephalography (MEG), the recruitment pattern within the primary
   sensory (S1) and motor (M1) areas was estimated through the morphology
   of the early components of somatosensory evoked magnetic fields (SEFs),
   after evaluating the S1 responsiveness to sensory inputs from the
   contralateral arm. In each hemisphere, network recruitment properties
   were correlated with ispilateral thalamus volume, estimated by
   morphometric techniques upon high-resolution 3D structural magnetic
   resonance images (MRI). S1 activation was preserved, whereas SEF
   morphology was strikingly distorted in MS patients, marking a disruption
   of primary somatosensory network patterning. An unbalance of S1-M1
   dynamic recruitment was documented and correlated with the thalamic
   volume reduction in the left hemisphere. These findings support the
   model of MS as a disconnection syndrome, with major susceptibility to
   damage experienced by nodes belonging to more frequently recruited and
   highly specialized networks. Hum Brain Mapp 31:1588-1600,2010. (c) 2010

Abstract = {{Background. A whole-body hypothermia protocol for term infants with
   hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) was implemented in our network in
   May 2004. The main objective of this study was to assess the feasibility
   of the protocol. The impact on the outcome was also assessed.
   Methods. Monocentric retrospective study of all term infants admitted
   for HIE after the implementation of the protocol. The feasibility of the
   protocol was evaluated by its observance during the first 72 h. The
   neurodevelopmental outcome at 12 months of age of this population was
   compared with a historical control group.
   Results. Twenty-five children were included. The protocol was not
   correctly applied for 8 children. The target temperature (33-34 degrees
   C) was not reached for 3 infants. Four infants were admitted after 6 h
   of age. In 1 infant, HIE was not diagnosed at admission. In the :17
   patients with a good protocol observance, rectal temperature fell to the
   target temperature on average at 6.4 h of age. The long-term follow-up
   rate was improved after the implementation of the protocol (100 \%
   versus 92 \% before protocol implementation). Death or
   neurodevelopmental disability occurred in 40 \% during the protocol
   period versus 87 \% before protocol implementation (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions. The main limiting factor for implementation of whole-body
   hypothermia in infants with HIE is admission delay. The follow-up and
   the rate of death or disability in infants with HIE improved after
   implementing the protocol. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{We study termination of programs in concurrent higher-order languages. A
   higher-order concurrent calculus combines features of the
   lambda-calculus and of the message-passing concurrent calculi. However,
   in contrast with the lambda A-calculus, a simply-typed discipline need
   not guarantee termination and, in contrast with message-passing calculi
   such as the pi-calculus, divergence can be obtained even without a
   recursion (or replication) construct.
   We first consider a higher-order calculus where only processes can be
   communicated. We propose a type system for termination that borrows
   ideas from termination in Rewriting Systems (and following the approach
   to termination in the pi-calculus in {[}3]). We then show how this type
   system can be adapted to accommodate higher-order functions in messages.
   Finally, we address termination in a richer calculus that includes
   localities and a passivation construct, as well as name-passing
   communication. We illustrate the expressiveness of the type systems on a
   few examples. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In 1982/1983 A. Bichara and F. Mazzocca characterized the Grassmann
   space Gr (h, A) of index h of an affine space A of dimension at least 3
   over a skew-field K by means of the intersection properties of the three
   disjoint families of maximal singular subspaces of Gr (h, A) and, till
   now, their result represents the only known characterization of Gr (h,
   A). If K is a commutative field and A has finite dimension m, then the
   image Gr (h, A)(p) under the well known Plucker morphism p is a proper
   subset A(m, h, K) of P G (M, K), M = ((m+1)(h+1)) - 1, called the affine
   Grassmannian of the h-subspaces of A. The aim of this paper is to
   introduce the notion of Affine Tallini Set and provide a natural and
   intrinsic characterization of A(m, h, K) from the point-line geometry
   point of view. More precisely, we prove that if a projective space over
   a skew-field K contains an Affine Tallini Set Delta satisfying suitable
   axioms on ``perp{''} of lines, then the skew-field K is forced to be a
   commutative field and Delta is an affine Grassmannian, up to
   projections. Furthermore, several results concerning Affine Tallini Sets
   are stated and proved.}},

Abstract = {{During HIV-1 entry, binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 to
   the cellular CD4 receptor triggers conformational changes resulting in
   exposure of new epitopes, the highly conserved CD4-induced (CD4i)
   epitopes that are essential for subsequent binding to chemokine receptor
   CCR5 or CXCR4. Due to their functional conservation, CD4i epitopes
   represent attractive viral targets for HIV-1 entry inhibition. The aim
   of the present study was to select peptide ligands for CD4i epitopes on
   native dualtropic (R5X4) HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoproteins by phage
   display. Using CD4-activated retroviral particles carrying Env from the
   R5X4 HIV-1 89.6 strain as the target, we performed screenings of random
   peptide phage libraries under stringent selection conditions. Selected
   peptides showed partial identity with amino acids in the extracellular
   domains of CCR5/CXCR4, including motifs rich in tyrosines and aspartates
   at the N terminus known to be important for gp120 binding. A synthetic
   peptide derivative (XD3) corresponding to the most frequently selected
   phages was optimized for Env binding on peptide arrays. Interestingly,
   the optimized peptide could bind specifically to gp120 derived from
   HIV-1 strains with different coreceptor usage, competed with binding of
   CD4i-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) 17b, and interfered with entry
   of both a CCR5 (R5)-tropic and a CXCR4 (X4)-tropic Env pseudotyped
   virus. This peptide ligand therefore points at unique properties of CD4i
   epitopes shared by gp120 with different coreceptor usage and could thus
   serve to provide new insight into the conserved structural details
   essential for coreceptor binding for further drug development.}},

Abstract = {{Prejudice and hate crimes against lesbians and gay men are prevalent
   throughout the United States. Prejudice in public school settings is
   particularly problematic for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) students
   and LGB parents. Efforts to reduce prejudice for LGB groups have met
   with limited success. Creating safer and more inclusive school
   environments is essential. An experimental mixed methods field design
   tested outcomes of an intergroup dialogue intervention on public school
   teacher attitudes, feelings, and behaviors toward LGB students and

Abstract = {{Defined as proteins actively transported via secretion systems, secreted
   proteins can have radically different subcellular destinations in
   monoderm (Gram-positive) bacteria. From degradative enzymes in
   saprophytes to virulence factors in pathogens, secreted proteins are the
   main tools used by bacteria to interact with their surroundings. The
   etiological agent of listeriosis, Listeria monocytogenes, is a
   Gram-positive facultative intracellular foodborne pathogen, whose
   ecological niche is the soil and as such should be primarily considered
   as a ubiquitous saprophyte. Recent advances on protein secretion systems
   in this species prompted us to investigate the exoproteome. First, an
   original and rational bioinformatic strategy was developed to mimic the
   protein exportation steps leading to the extracellular localization of
   secreted proteins; 79 exoproteins were predicted as secreted via Sec, 1
   exoprotein via Tat, 4 bacteriocins via ABC exporters, 3 exoproteins via
   holins, and 3 exoproteins via the WXG100 system. This bioinformatic
   analysis allowed for defining a databank of the mature protein set in L.
   monocytogenes, which was used for generating the theoretical exoproteome
   and for subsequent protein identification by proteomics. 2-DE proteomic
   analyses were performed over a wide pl range to experimentally cover the
   largest protein spectrum possible. A total of 120 spots could be
   resolved and identified, which corresponded to 50 distinct proteins.
   These exoproteins were essentially virulence factors, degradative
   enzymes, and proteins of unknown functions, which exportation would
   essentially rely on the Sec pathway or nonclassical secretion. This
   investigation resulted in the first comprehensive appraisal of the
   exoproteome of L. monocytogenes EGD-e based on theoretical and
   experimental secretomic analyses, which further provided indications on
   listerial physiology in relation with its habitat and lifestyle. The
   novel and rational strategy described here is generic and has been
   purposely designed for the prediction of proteins localized
   extracellularly in monoderm bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether the
   alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient is an adequate screening test
   for pulmonary embolism (PE) in pregnancy and postpartum.
   STUDY DESIGN: A chart review was performed at Tampa General Hospital.
   Patients who had a workup for a PE consisting of a computed tomography
   pulmonary angiogram and an arterial blood gas from 2002 to 2009 were
   included in the analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and
   positive predictive values were calculated. Additionally, common
   clinical signs and symptoms were assessed for their ability to
   accurately predict PE.
   RESULTS: Of 102 patients, there were 13 PEs (2 antepartum and 11
   postpartum). The best sensitivity, specificity, and negative and
   positive predictive values for A-a gradients were 76.9\%, 20.2\%,
   80.0\%, and 11.5\%, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: The A-a gradient is a poor screening test for PE in
   pregnancy and postpartum. Suspicion of PE should prompt early imaging
   studies to rapidly make the diagnosis and begin treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims:
   AIDS cholangiopathy is presently considered rare and has been reported
   mainly from the West. With the HIV epidemic in India, we have
   encountered an increasing number of patients. We aimed to study these
   patients and determine differences from earlier experiences.
   Methods:
   We describe the clinical presentation, cholangiographic features, and
   outcome and determine differences reported in Western literature.
   Results:
   From Jan 1999 to May 2009, 30 patients (27 men) with AIDS cholangiopathy
   were seen. The most common mode of transmission was heterosexual (n =
   28) followed by blood transfusion (n = 2). Abdominal pain (n = 20) of
   biliary origin, was the commonest manifestation followed by an
   asymptomatic group (n = 6) and a third group (n = 3) with pain due to
   pancreatitis. Ultrasonography of the abdomen was abnormal in all
   patients. Papillary stenosis (n = 23) was the most common
   cholangiographic feature followed by sclerosing cholangitis (n = 5).
   Abdominal pain resolved reliably and promptly after endoscopic
   sphincterotomy. Cholangiographic abnormalities regressed during follow
   up on antiretroviral therapy in 10 patients. Seven patients on anti
   retroviral therapy developed de novo cholangiopathy, with a precipitous
   drop in CD4 count of whom two had a worse prognosis. None had Kaposi's
   sarcoma.
   Conclusions:
   In contrast to Western literature, HIV cholangiopathy was seen
   predominantly in patients who acquired HIV by heterosexual transmission.
   De novo development of cholangiopathy on antiretroviral therapy may
   indicate the occurrence of resistance. Papillary stenosis is the most
   common feature. Abdominal pain resolved with sphincterotomy. Regression
   of cholangiographic abnormality occurred with anti retroviral
   medications. Median survival following cholangiopathy diagnosis was 34
   months, higher than reported in previous studies.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the prospective association of depressive symptoms
   with circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) and to determine the direction
   of that association. Methods: Using data from 2,544 healthy participants
   in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (ages,
   33-45 years; 55\% female; 42\% black), we examined the prospective
   association of depressive symptoms, as measured by the Centers for
   Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, with circulating CRP 5 years
   later. Results: Depressive symptoms in the Coronary Artery Risk
   Development in Young Adults study Year 15 predicted CRP at Year 20,
   independent of demographic characteristics, biological and medical risk
   factors, health behaviors, and Year 15 CRP. This association, however,
   was conditional on race such that the increase in CRP with increasing
   depressive symptoms was present in blacks but not whites. In neither
   blacks nor whites did Year 15 CRP predict Year 20 depressive symptoms.
   Among black participants, when examined in separate analyses, higher
   scores on the depressed affect and somatic symptoms subscales of the
   Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and lower scores on
   the positive affect subscale were associated with greater Year 20 CRP.
   The interpersonal problems subscale was unrelated to CRP. When all four
   subscale scores were entered simultaneously in the same model, black
   participants' scores on the positive affect and somatic symptoms
   subscales emerged as independent predictors of Year 20 CRP, whereas the
   depressed affect and interpersonal problems subscales did not.
   Conclusions: Depressive symptoms may be linked more closely to
   inflammation in blacks than in whites.}},

Abstract = {{This paper attempts to formulate Overall Thermal Transfer Value (OTTV)
   coefficients for Composite, Hot-Dry and Warm-Humid climates, the three
   main tropical climates in India. Four existing air-conditioned office
   buildings - two mid-rise and two high-rise were modeled as case studies
   using eQuest v.3.6, which is a DoE2.2, based building energy simulation
   tool. Based on the study of building envelope, loads, operation and HVAC
   system characteristics of these case study buildings, a hypothetical
   high-rise, 16 storey office building, octagonal in plan was created for
   parametric studies. 98 types of opaque exterior wall constructions and
   93 types of glass constructions were varied sequentially in parametric
   runs to obtain results for hourly wall conduction, glass conduction and
   glass radiation heat flow in eight orientations for each of the climate
   type. These hourly results were processed to obtain annual heat gain
   intensities for each parametric case for all three modes of heat
   transfer. Regression analysis was used to obtain the OTTV coefficients -
   TDeq, DT and SF for the three climates. A new OTTV equation is obtained
   and presented. The set of coefficients obtained were verified by
   calculating the OTTV for the four case study buildings, for various
   parametric runs. The computed OTTV for the four case study buildings
   exhibits good linear correlation with the annual space cooling plus
   heating energy use in three climates. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Postoperative Acquired Coagulopathy: A Pilot Study to Determine the
   Impact on Clinical and Economic Outcomes}},

Abstract = {{Study Objective. To characterize the clinical factors associated with
   postoperative acquired coagulopathy, and to estimate the economic impact
   of resources used to treat postoperative patients with this coagulopathy
   compared with postoperative patients who did not develop the
   coagulopathy.
   Design. Case-control study.
   Setting. Academically affiliated public hospital and level I trauma
   referral center.
   Patients. Twenty-six patients (mean age 53.9 yrs) who experienced
   acquired coagulopathy after undergoing an index surgery (cases), and 26
   patients (mean age 50.8 yrs) matched to these case patients by index
   surgery, age, and sex (controls).
   Measurements and Main Results. Data were collected from a database of
   5367 adult surgical admissions over 6 months during 2008, corresponding
   inpatient electronic health records, billing data, and Medicare
   Resource-Based Relative Value Scale payments. Case patients had a
   minimum of two postoperative consecutively drawn episodes of prothrombin
   time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) elevated to
   greater than 20\% above the upper limit of normal. Patients with
   inherited clotting disorders or other identifiable causes of
   coagulopathy were excluded. Case patients underwent the following
   surgeries: 12 orthopedic (46\%), six cardiovascular (23\%), four
   gastrointestinal (15\%), and four neurosurgical (15\%). Mean values of
   the first elevated PT and aPTT were 19.7 and 50.8 seconds, respectively.
   Mean postoperative stay was 31.5 days for cases versus 9.8 days for
   controls (p<0.05). Mean cost (2008 U.S. dollars) of resources used was
   \$112,280 for cases versus \$38,357 for controls (p<0.001). Costs
   incurred between the onset of coagulopathy and discharge constituted
   67\% of postoperative costs. Physician reimbursement expenditures were
   minimal.
   Conclusion. Postoperative acquired coagulopathy was associated with
   stays that were 3 times longer and resource use costs that were 3 times
   higher than those of controls. This type of coagulopathy may be an
   under-recognized and underappreciated event. The case-control design is
   limited to exploring associations and does not establish causality
   Prospective studies need to be conducted to establish the causes of
   acquired coagulopathy and methods for screening and diagnosing this
   condition.}},

Title = {{How and why do South Asians attend GUM clinics? Evidence from
   contrasting GUM clinics across England}},
Journal = {{SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{Background Improving access to sexual healthcare is a priority in the
   UK, especially for ethnic minorities. Though South Asians in the UK
   report low levels of sexual ill health, few data exist regarding their
   use of genitourinary medicine (GUM) services.
   Objectives To describe reasons for attendance at GUM clinics among
   individuals of South Asian origin relative to patients of other
   ethnicities.
   Methods 4600 new attendees (5\% South Asian; n=226) at seven
   sociodemographically and geographically contrasting GUM clinics across
   England completed a questionnaire between October 2004 and March 2005,
   which were linked to routine clinical data.
   Results South Asians were more likely than other groups to be signposted
   to the GUM clinic by another health serviced-for example, in women 14\%
   versus 8\% respectively (p=0.005) reported doing so from a family
   planning clinic. These women also reported that they would be less
   likely to go to the clinic if their symptoms resolved spontaneously
   compared with other women (51\% vs 31\%, p=0.024). However, relative to
   other clinic attendees, no differences in the proportions of South
   Asians who had acute STI(s) diagnosed at clinic were noted. Furthermore,
   South Asian men were more likely to report as their reason for
   attendance that they wanted an HIV test (23.4\% vs 14.8\%, p=0.005).
   Conclusion Despite having similar STI care needs to attendees from other
   ethnic groups, South Asians, especially women, may be reluctant to seek
   care from GUM clinics, especially if their symptoms resolve. Sexual
   health services need to develop locally-delivered and
   culturally-appropriate initiatives to improve care pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction.
   Yoga is practiced both in developing and developed countries. Many
   patients and yoga protagonists claim that it is useful in improving
   sexual functions and treating sexual disorders.
   Aim.
   We wanted to study the effect of yoga on male sexual functioning.
   Methods.
   We studied 65 males (age range = 24-60 years, average age = 40 +/- 8.26
   years) who were enrolled in a yoga camp and administered a known
   questionnaire, i.e., Male Sexual Quotient (MSQ) before and after 12
   weeks session of yoga.
   Main Outcome Measures.
   MSQ scores before and after yoga sessions.
   Results.
   It was found that after the completion of yoga sessions, the sexual
   functions scores were significantly improved (P < 0.0001). The
   improvement occurred in scores of all the domains of sexual functions as
   studied by MSQ (desire, intercourse satisfaction, performance,
   confidence, partner synchronization, erection, ejaculatory control,
   orgasm).
   Conclusions.
   Yoga appears to be an effective method of improving all domains of
   sexual functions in men as studied by MSQ. Dhikav V, Karmarkar G, Verma

Abstract = {{A minimum volume (MV) set, at level alpha, is a set G(alpha){*} having
   minimum volume among all those sets containing at least a probability
   mass. MV sets provide a natural notion of the `central mass' of a
   distribution and, as such, have recently become popular as a tool for
   the detection of anomalies in multivariate data. Motivated by the fact
   that anomaly detection problems frequently arise in settings with
   temporally indexed measurements, we propose here a new method for the
   estimation of MV sets from dependent data. Our method is based on the
   concept of complexity-penalized estimation, extending recent work of
   Scott and Nowak for the case of independent and identically distributed
   measurements, and has both desirable theoretical properties and a
   practical implementation. Of particular note is the fact that, for a
   large class of stochastic processes, choice of an appropriate complexity
   penalty reduces to the selection of a single tuning parameter, which
   represents the data dependency of the underlying stochastic process.
   While in reality the dependence structure is unknown, we offer a
   data-dependent method for selecting this parameter, based on subsampling
   principles. Our work is motivated by and illustrated through an
   application to the detection of anomalous traffic levels in Internet
   traffic time series. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The adult spleen harbors a population of naturally occurring multipotent
   stem cells of non-lymphoid lineage (CD45-). In animal models, these
   splenic stem cells can directly or indirectly contribute to regeneration
   of bone, inner ear, cranial nerves, islets, hearts and salivary glands.
   Here we characterize the CD45- stem cell proteome to determine its
   potential broader multipotency versus its protection from malignant
   transformation. Using state-of-the-art proteomics and in vivo testing,
   we performed functional analyses of unique proteins of CD45-
   (non-lymphoid) splenic stem cells, as compared with CD45+ (lymphoid)
   cells. CD45- stem cell-specific proteins were identical to those in iPS,
   including OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC and NANOG. They also expressed
   Hox11, Gli3, Wnt2, and Adam12, the benchmark transcription factors of
   embryonic stem cells. These transcription factors were functional
   because their mRNA was upregulated in the spleen in association with
   ongoing damage to the pancreas and salivary glands, organs to which they
   normally contribute stem cells. We also show low likelihood of malignant
   transformation. Our proteomic and functional analyses reveals that
   naturally occurring CD45- stem cells of the spleen are the first-ever
   candidates for naturally occurring population of embryonic and iPS cells
   with low oncogenic risk. Given their presence in normal humans and mice,
   splenic stem cells are poised for translational research. (c) 2009

Abstract = {{Palladium nanoparticles supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes,
   denoted as Pd/MWCNTs, were prepared by simple pyrolysis of PdCl2 aqueous
   solution plus HCl. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy
   were used to characterize the Pd/MWCNTs obtained, and the results showed
   that the diameter of the palladium nanoparticles immobilized on the
   MWCNTs was close to 30 nm. Energy dispersive spectroscopy proved the
   existence of elemental Pd on the surface of the MWCNTs. The
   electrocatalytic performance of the Pd/MWCNTs in the ethanol oxidation
   reaction was probed using cyclic voltammetry. This demonstrated that it
   would be possible to utilize the Pd/MWCNTs as anode material in fuel
   cells. The main contribution of this preliminary work is the development
   of a novel and simple method to prepare palladium nanoparticles on
   MWCNTs, which will be helpful in the preparation of Pd nanoparticles on
   a large scale. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a technology for rapidly generating novel and fully

   variable fragment (scFv) antibody library was constructed in a yeast

   mature sequence of human interleukin-8 (hIL8) into the yeast two-hybrid
   system vector, we have screened the human scFv antibody library and
   obtained three distinct scFv clones that could specifically bind to
   hIL8. One clone was chosen for further improvement by a novel affinity
   maturation process using the error-prone PCR of the scFv sequence
   followed by additional rounds of yeast two-hybrid screening. The scFv
   antibodies of both primary and affinity-matured scFv clones were
   expressed in E. coli. All purified scFvs showed specific binding to hIL8
   in reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and ELISA assays. All scFvs, as well
   as a fully human IgG antibody converted from one of the scFv clones and
   expressed in the mammalian cells, were able to effectively inhibit hIL8
   in neutrophil chemotaxis assays. The technology described can generate
   fully human antibodies with high efficiency and low cost.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the far-infrared (FIR) laser (lambda(0) 0 = 432 mu m) Faraday
   rotation measurement system on MST has been upgraded. The dc flowing-gas

   at 9.27 mu m (GEM select 100, Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA), which is
   subdivided equally into three parts to simultaneously pump three FIR
   cavities. The total infrared pump power is approximately 80 W on the 9R
   (20) line required to pump the formic acid molecule. Each FIR cavity
   produces similar to 12 mW, sufficient for 11 simultaneous chord
   interferometry-polarimetry operations. Three key issues {[}(1)
   conservation of circularly polarized wave, (2) colinearity of two probe
   waves, and (3) stability of intermediate frequencies between lasers]
   affecting the Faraday rotation measurement have been resolved
   experimentally. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{IPLV overall coefficient, presented by Air-Conditioning and
   Refrigeration Institute (ARI) of America, shows running/operation status
   of air-conditioning system host only. For overall operation coefficient,
   logical solution has not been developed, to reflect the whole
   air-conditioning system under part load. In this research undertaking,
   the running time proportions of air-conditioning systems under part load
   have been obtained through analysis on energy consumption data during
   practical operation in all public buildings in Chongqing. This was
   achieved by using analysis methods, based on the statistical energy
   consumption data distribution of public buildings month-by-month.
   Comparing with the weight number of IPLV, part load operation
   coefficient of air-conditioning system, based on this research, does not
   only show the status of system refrigerating host, but also reflects and
   calculate energy efficiency of the whole air-conditioning system. The
   coefficient results from the processing and analyzing of practical
   running data, shows the practical running status of area and building
   type (actual and objective) - not clear. The method is different from
   model analysis which gets IPLV weight number, in the sense that this
   method of coefficient results in both four equal proportions and also

Journal = {{CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Observational studies consistently have identified that
   social support is negatively associated with depression among
   adolescents. The causal connections between these two factors, however,
   are not well understood. Does the relationship between social support
   and depression indicate that social support protects against depression,
   or that characteristics of these less depressed adolescents make it
   easier for them to obtain social support? To address this, this study
   examines whether social support predicts later depressive symptoms,
   controlling for earlier clinical presentation.
   Methods: The sample comprised adolescents (n = 777) who were assessed as
   part of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being.
   Caregivers and youth provided information about children's clinical
   characteristics and family background. Propensity scoring was used to
   adjust for baseline covariates when examining the impact of social
   support at eighteen months post-baseline on depressive symptoms at three
   years post-baseline.
   Results: Children who received more social support at eighteen months
   post-baseline had fewer depressive symptoms at three years
   post-baseline, even after adjusting for baseline covariates using the
   propensity score; however, the adjusted effect size was small.
   Conclusion: Previous attempts to study the impact of social support
   without adjusting for possible confounders have likely inflated the
   independently predictive role of social support. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We evaluated the capability of soluble cardiac biomarkers to predict
   tolerability and outcomes of IMiD-containing treatments among 106
   patients treated on clinical trials. Baseline elevations in troponin T
   (TnT) and N-terminal brain naturietic protein (NT-proBNP) predicted for
   an inability to tolerate IMiD-based regimens. The best predictors for
   early attrition during cycle 1 were TnT >= 0.07 mu g/L and NT-proBNP >=
   11,939 ng/L. NT-proBNP-response under-performed TnT-response as a
   predictor for overall survival (OS), but both predicted for early
   protocol attrition. Despite hematologic response, IMiD-treated patients
   were at higher risk for NT-proBNP rises and early drug discontinuation
   than a control population but not for early death. These observations
   prompt two questions: (1) does IMiD-based therapy lead to increased
   fluid retention and/or cardiac toxicity and (2) is an NT-proBNP-driven
   cardiac response system valid in IMiD-treated amyloidosis patients?
   Recognition of potential drug-induced cardiac toxicity is important so
   that increased cardiac surveillance and drug dose-adjustment or
   discontinuation may be implemented. Am. J. Hematol. 85:757-759, 2010.

Abstract = {{Correlated survival times can be modelled by introducing a random
   effect, or frailty component, into the hazard function. For multivariate
   survival data, we extend a non-proportional hazards (PH) model, the
   generalized time-dependent logistic survival model, to include random
   effects. The hierarchical likelihood procedure, which obviates the need
   for marginalization over the random effect distribution, is derived for
   this extended model and its properties are discussed. The extended model
   leads to a robust estimation result for the regression parameters
   against the misspecification of the form of the basic hazard function or
   frailty distribution compared to PH-based alternatives. The proposed
   method is illustrated by two practical examples and a simulation study
   which demonstrate the advantages of the new model.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To review the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants for
   negative behavioral symptoms (ie, apathy, excessive daytime sedation)
   and cognition in patients with dementia.
   DATA SOURCES: Literature was accessed through PubMed and MEDLINE
   (1966-June 2010), using the terms stimulant, psychostimulant,
   methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine,
   lisdexamfetamine, atomoxetine, modafinil, armodafinil, dementia,
   Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, mixed
   dementia, frontotemporal dementia, therapy, treatment, and therapeutic.
   Additional references identified from the initial search were reviewed.
   STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All relevant clinical trials
   published in English and involving primarily older adults with dementia
   were included. Case reports, review articles, and other preclinical
   literature were included as appropriate.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: Psychostimulants have been employed as a treatment for
   cognitive and behavioral symptoms in dementia for decades, but the
   literature has lagged behind this practice. Eight reports on use of
   psychostimulants as a treatment of apathy in dementia were reviewed.
   Methylphenidate was the most frequently studied medication and
   improvements in apathy were consistently noted; however, the magnitude
   and duration of effect remain unclear. Six studies examining the
   cognitive effects of a variety of psychostimulants in patients with
   dementia were reviewed; psychostimulants had little to no effect on
   cognition. A lack of studies exists to draw conclusions about the use of
   psychostimulants for the treatment of excessive daytime sedation in
   dementia. The possibility of psychostimulants to increase blood
   pressure; elevate heart rate; and lead to irritability, agitation, and
   psychosis makes careful patient selection critical, especially in older
   adults with severe cardiovascular disease or other underlying cardiac
   abnormalities.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on limited studies, methylphenidate is a possible
   treatment for apathy in patients with dementia. Psychostimulants, as a
   group, do not appear to be broadly effective treatments for behavioral
   or cognitive symptoms of dementia. The potential utility of
   psychostimulants must be balanced with careful patient selection.}},

Abstract = {{Abrasive wear resistance of injection molded polycarbonate (PC) and
   polycarbonate + zinc oxide nanocomposites containing 0.5 wt\% ZnO
   nanoparticles was determined as a function of the sliding direction with
   respect to injection flow. First we have performed single scratch
   testing under progressively increasing the load applied. Then sliding
   wear testing consisting of 15 successive scratches along the same groove
   was performed. Neat PC shows anisotropic behavior, with instantaneous
   penetration depth more than 50\% higher in the direction parallel to the
   melt injection flow than in the transverse direction. Viscoelastic
   recovery after scratching of neat PC is also higher in the longitudinal
   than in the transverse direction, hence final residual depth values are
   similar in both directions. The addition of ZnO nanoparticles reduces
   the instantaneous penetration depth in the longitudinal direction but
   lowers viscoelastic recovery so that the residual depth is large. In the
   transverse direction, the scratch resistance is similar for neat PC and
   the nanocomposite. Dynamic mechanical analysis, SEM/FIB results and wear
   mechanisms from SEM observations of wear scars are discussed. Below the
   glass transition region the nanocomposite has distinctly higher storage
   modulus E' than PC-a clear reinforcement effect. However, the addition
   of ZnO nanoparticles to the polymer increases the material brittleness
   at room temperature by a factor of 2.72.}},

Abstract = {{Membrane protein function is determined by the relative organization of
   the protein domains with respect to the membrane. We have experimentally
   verified the topology of a protein with diverse orientations arising
   from a single primary sequence (the cellular prion protein, PrPC), a
   novel somatostatin truncated receptor, and the Golgi-associated protein
   GPBP(91). Tagging with fluorescent proteins (FP) allows location of
   their expression at the plasma membrane or at endomembranes, but does
   not inform about their orientation. Exploiting the pH dependency of some
   FPs, we developed a pH exchange assay in which extracellularly exposed
   FPs are quenched by application of low pH buffer. We constructed
   standards to demonstrate and calibrate the assay, and the method was
   adapted for acidic organelle membrane proteins. This method can serve as
   a proof of concept, experimentally confirming and/or discriminating in
   living cells among theoretical topology predictions, providing the
   proportion of inside/outside orientation for proteins with multiple
   forms.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To gain an understanding of patterns of retention and attrition for
   student nurses on the diploma of higher education (DipHE)/bachelor of
   science (B.Sc.) (adult) on completion of the common foundation programme
   (CFP = year 1 of the programme).
   Method: A questionnaire called the ``interview score sheet{''} (ISS)
   collected data on six cohorts from a Higher Education Institution in
   Scotland. At the initial recruitment interview each candidate was scored
   independently by two interviewers on the ISS.
   Method: Successful/unsuccessful attempts of theory-based and
   practice-based modules, and any reasons for attrition were recorded
   throughout the CFP. For the purposes of this study success was defined
   as achieving a pass grade in all modules associated with year 1 of the
   programme. Main outcome measures: The study investigated the potential
   of the ISS in providing a reliable guide for student selection onto the
   DipHE/B.Sc. in nursing (adult) and providing information about the
   characteristics of a typical successful/unsuccessful student from the
   CFP.
   Analysis: Statistical analysis was conducted to examine the correlation
   between the total score on the ISS, any characteristics on the ISS and
   the students' successful completion of the CFP.
   Results: Six-hundred and thirty-eight students entered the CFP: 118
   (18\%) were unsuccessful and 520 (82\%) were successful completers of
   the CFP. From the characteristics noted at interview on the ISS, the
   most reliable predictor of success was age. The total score achieved on
   the ISS was shown not to be a reliable predictor of success. Although
   not statistically significant, testing of numeracy and standard and
   content of written work may be of some value in predicting success and
   may warrant further study. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Peptide dendrimers consist of a peptidyl branching core and/or
   covalently attached surface functional units. They show a variety of
   biological properties, including antiviral activity. In this study, a
   minilibrary of linear, dimeric, and dendrimeric peptides containing
   clusters of basic amino acids was evaluated for in vitro activity
   against human papillomaviruses (HPVs). The peptide dendrimer SB105-A10
   was found to be a potent inhibitor of genital HPV types (i.e., types 16,
   18, and 6) in pseudovirus-based neutralization assays. The 50\%
   inhibitory concentration was between 2.8 and 4.2 mu g/ml (0.59 and 0.88
   mu M), and no evidence of cytotoxicity was observed. SB105-A10 interacts
   with immobilized heparin and with heparan sulfates exposed on the cell
   surface, most likely preventing virus attachment. The findings from this
   study indicate SB105-A10 to be a leading candidate compound for further
   development as an active ingredient of a topical microbicide against HPV
   and other sexually transmitted viral infections.}},

Abstract = {{The rice (Oryza sativa L.) metallothionein gene OsMT-I-4b has previously
   been identified as a type I MT gene. To elucidate the regulatory
   mechanism involved in its tissue specificity and abiotic induction, we
   isolated a 1 730 bp fragment of the OsMT-I-4b promoter region.
   Histochemical beta-glucuronidase (GUS) staining indicated a precise
   spacial and temporal expression pattern in transgenic Arabidopsis.
   Higher GUS activity was detected in the roots and the buds of flower
   stigmas, and relatively lower GUS staining in the shoots was restricted
   to the trichomes and hydathodes of leaves. No activity was observed in
   the stems and seeds. Additionally, in the root of transgenic plants, the
   promoter activity was highly upregulated by various environmental
   signals, such as abscisic acid, drought, dark, and heavy metals
   including Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb2+ and Al3+. Slight induction was observed in
   transgenic seedlings under salinity stress, or when treated with Co2+
   and Cd2+. Promoter analysis of 5'-deletions revealed that the region
   -583/-1 was sufficient to drive strong GUS expression in the roots but
   not in the shoots. Furthermore, deletion analysis indicated important
   promoter regions containing different metal-responsive cis-elements that
   were responsible for responding to different heavy metals. Collectively,
   these findings provided important insight into the transcriptional
   regulation mechanisms of the OsMT-I-4b promoter, and the results also
   gave us some implications for the potential application of this promoter
   in plant genetic engineering.}},

Volume = {{32}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Literary ``otherness{''} in contemporary French literature represents a
   developmental trend in human cultural history in general, which can also
   be viewed as a mix of various subjects of liberal arts. Again, it has
   rendered it possible that inclusive and exclusive ``otherness{''} has
   merged to such extent that literature identity can not be easily
   authenticated. French literary ``otherness{''} refers ultimately to the
   idea of ``boundlessness{''}, which may be experimental in beating a new
   trail that can originally be discerned in the ancient Chinese classics.
   In contemporary French literature, literary ``otherness{''} also means
   ``unavailability{''} in terms of literary style, genre, discipline and
   theme. Largely speaking, it means ``unavailable{''} in the physical
   world; the making of human culture should not be without. In view of
   above, the ``otherness{''} of French literature will enable
   practitioners to return to literary creative practice at a still higher
   level.}},

Abstract = {{Genistein is a naturally occurring plant-derived phytoestrogen, present
   in the human diet, known to possess some beneficial effects. The present
   study investigated the effect of genistein on neuroprotection evaluated
   through electroencephalographic and behavioural correlates in a model of
   global cerebral ischemia in gerbils. Over the dose range tested,
   genistein (3 and 10 mg/kg), given 5 min after recirculation antagonized
   the ischemia-induced electroencephalographic total spectral power
   decrease 7 days after ischemia; fully prevented ischemia-induced
   hyperlocomotion evaluated 1 day after ischemia; reversed
   ischemia-induced memory impairment evaluated through both nest building
   behaviour and object recognition test; decreased malondialdehyde
   overproduction in the brain, evaluated 7 days after reperfusion; and
   fully promoted the survival of pyramidal cells in the CA, hippocampal
   subfield. The selective antagonist for estrogen receptor-beta (ER beta),
   4{[}2-phenyl-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)
   pyrazolo{[}1,5-alpha]pyrimidin-3-yl]phenol (PHTPP) given 30 min before
   carotid occlusion, fully prevented the neuroprotective effect of
   genistein at the dose of 3 mg/kg. These results demonstrate the
   neuroprotective effect of genistein through the activation of ER beta
   and provide further grounds for the growing interest concerning the true
   potential of phytoestrogens as compounds to beneficially affect brain
   injury without having the disadvantages of estrogens.}},

   the New Zealand legislation aims to suffuse good faith with considerable

   that the Aurora kinases might be attractive therapeutic targets in
   oncology. Drugs targeting the mitotic spindle such as taxanes and vinca
   alkaloids have been notably successful in cancer medicine. The Aurora
   kinase inhibitors represent the latest entrants into this arena.
   Inhibitors of Aurora kinases have shown promising results in preclinical
   studies, and are currently under evaluation in numerous clinical trials.
   Considerable additional work will be required in order to optimize their
   use in the clinic, including identifying biomarkers for selection of
   sensitive tumors, refining the administration schedule of these agents
   and developing useful combinations of Aurora kinase inhibitors with
   existing cancer therapeutics. This review article will summarize the
   function of each of the Aurora kinases, with emphasis on their role in
   tumorigenesis and interactions with other cellular pathways that govern
   tumor biology. It also discusses those inhibitors that are in the clinic
   and summarizes the early clinical data.}},

Abstract = {{Rodeo Lagoon, a low-salinity coastal lagoon in the Golden Gate National
   Recreation Area, California, United States, has been identified as an
   important ecosystem due to the presence of the endangered goby
   (Eucyclogobius newberri). Despite low anthropogenic impacts, the lagoon
   exhibits eutrophic conditions and supports annual episodes of very high
   phytoplankton biomass. Weekly assessments (February-December 2007) of
   phytoplankton indicated diatoms, Nodularia spumigena, Chaetoceros
   muelleri var. muelleri, flagellated protozoa, a mixed assemblage, and
   Microcystis aeruginosa dominated the algal community in successive
   waves. Phytoplankton succession was significantly correlated (r (2) =
   0.37, p < 0.001) with averaged daily irradiance (max = 29.7 kW m(-2)
   d(-1)), water column light attenuation (max = 14 m(-1)), and
   orthophosphate and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations (max = 1.5
   and 2920 mu M, respectively). Negative effects of phytoplankton growth
   and decay included excessive ammonia concentrations (exceeded EPA
   guidelines on 77\% of sampling days), hypoxia (< 3 mg l(-1) dissolved
   oxygen), and introduction of several microcystins, all in the latter
   half of the year. Our one-year study suggests that this coastal lagoon
   is a highly seasonal system with strong feedbacks between phytoplankton
   and geochemical processes.}},

Abstract = {{Studies provide ample evidence for a dysfunction in dopaminergic
   neurotransmission in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In
   that respect, a common variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR)
   polymorphism in the 3'untranslated region (UTR) of the dopamine
   transporter gene (SLC6A3) has been repeatedly associated with the
   disorder. Here, we examined the influence of the common 9- and 10-repeat
   alleles of SLC6A3 on prefrontal brain functioning and cognitive response
   control in a large sample of adult ADHD patients (n = 161) and healthy
   controls (n 109). To this end, we inspected a neurophysiological marker
   of cognitive response control (NoGo anteriorization, NGA) elicited by
   means of a Go-NoGo task (continuous performance test, CPT). Within the
   group of ADHD patients, nine-repeat allele carriers showed significantly
   reduced NGA, whereas no influence of SLC6A3 genotype was observed in the
   control group. In contrast to previous association studies of children,
   the nine-repeat-not the 10-repeat-allele was associated with functional
   impairments in our sample of adult ADHD patients. Our findings confirm a
   significant effect of the SLC6A3 genotype on the neurophysiological
   correlates of cognitive response control in ADHD, and indicate that
   still to-be-identified age-related factors are important variables
   modulating the effect of genetic factors on endophenotypes.

Abstract = {{Aims:
   This work aims to investigate the binding capability of certain domains
   at N terminus of the protein NP\_785232 of Lactobacillus plantarum to
   Caco-2 cells and to test the usage of affinity chromatography to isolate
   the human mucus component that interacts with them.
   Methods and Results:
   Recombinant proteins containing the first and both the first and second
   domains at N terminus of NP\_785232 fused to a His tag were constructed
   and used to bind the Caco-2 cells. The interacting molecule from human
   mucus was isolated by affinity chromatography through immobilizing the
   recombinant proteins onto a Sepharose matrix. It was found both
   recombinant proteins could block the adhesion of Lact. plantarum to
   Caco-2 cells and bind to a human mucus component.
   Conclusions:
   The first and both the first and second domains at N terminus of the
   protein NP\_785232 have the capability to adhere Caco-2 cells and by
   affinity chromatography, an interacting UV-absorbing component from
   human mucus was isolated.
   Significance and Impact of the Study:
   The protein domains characterized in this study may be displayed on
   probiotics to promote adhesion, and further characterization of the
   human mucus component might be helpful to identify host factors required
   for prolonging probiotics persistence in the gastrointestinal tract.}},
