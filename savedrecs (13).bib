   the similarities and differences between the national football

Abstract = {{The influence of protected areas on childhood education is often assumed
   to be positive, and integrated conservation and development programmes
   (ICDPs) typically support childhood education by building schools,
   providing scholarships and improving education quality, which in turn
   helps build conservation attitudes. In this paper, the impact of a
   protected area on childhood education is examined within the broader
   socioeconomic context of villages bordering Kibale National Park
   (Uganda). Survey data from households and primary schools indicated
   ICDPs improved primary school enrolment and education for girls.
   However, crop raiding by Park-protected animals reduced the probability
   of boys completing four years of primary education because they were
   preferentially held back from school to guard crops. Since population
   growth around protected areas is a threat to conservation, and since
   extending education for both boys and girls helps reduce birth rates and
   improve future employment opportunities, helping children attain primary
   school completion supports both conservation and development objectives.
   The findings highlight the need to continue supporting childhood
   education near protected areas; however, additional focus should be
   placed on boys' educational attainment, and the need for wildlife
   authorities, governments and conservation organizations to invest in
   crop-raiding defences to mitigate crop-raiding losses.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the
   diagnostic confidence level of preoperative 160-slice computed
   tomography (CT) findings compared with that of perioperative findings
   about anatomic variations in the structure of the facial canal, lateral
   semicircular canal, and dural plate.
   Materials and Methods: Fifty-five patients who presented with middle ear
   pathology to Department of Otolaryngology, Afyon Kocatepe University
   Faculty of Medicine were included in the study, and the mean age was 42
   (+/- 15.55) years. Preoperative CT images of the temporal bone were
   obtained by an 80-detector row CT scanner.
   Results: The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative
   predictive values of preoperative high-resolution CT (HRCT) were 52\%,
   88\%, 73\%, and 75\%, respectively, for determining the presence of
   facial canal dehiscence; 50\%, 89\%, 71\%, and 76\%, respectively, for
   determining the presence of tympanic segment dehiscence; 71\%, 96\%,
   71\%, and 96\%, respectively, for determining the presence of lateral
   semicircular canal dehiscence; and 100\%, 96\%, 50\%, and 100\%,
   respectively, for detecting the presence of dural plate defects.
   Conclusion: The compatibility of HRCT findings with surgical findings in
   determining the presence of dehiscence of the facial canal and its
   tympanic segment was moderate, while it was good in determining the
   presence of dehiscence of the lateral semicircular canal and the defect
   of the dural plate.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Biologic therapies are efficacious but costly. A number of
   health economic models have been developed to determine the most
   cost-effective way of using them in the treatment pathway. These models
   have produced conflicting results, driven by differences in assumptions,
   model structure, and data, which undermine the credibility of funding
   decisions based on modeling studies. A Consensus Working Party met to
   discuss recommendations and approaches for future models of biologic
   therapies.
   Methods: Our working party consisted of clinical specialists, modelers,
   and policy makers. Two 1-day meetings were held for members to arrive at
   consensus positions on model structure, assumptions, and appropriate
   data sources. These views were guided by clinical aspects of rheumatoid
   and psoriatic arthritis and the principles of evidence-based medicine.
   Where opinions differed, we sought to identify a research agenda that
   would generate the evidence needed to reach consensus.
   Results: We gained consensus in four areas of model development: initial
   response to treatment; long-term disease progression; lifetime costs and
   benefits; and model structure. Consensus was also achieved on some key
   parameters such as choices of outcome measures, methods for
   extrapolation beyond trial data, and treatment switching. A research
   agenda to support further consensus was also identified.
   Conclusion: Consensus guidance that fully reflects current evidence and
   clinical understanding was gained successfully. In addition, research
   needs have been identified. Such guidance can be updated as evidence
   develops and policy questions change and need not be prescriptive as
   long as deviations from consensus are clearly explained and justified.

Abstract = {{Weak or non-existing linkage of official registers in the Republic of
   Croatia and the data redundancy as an inevitable outcome of such a state
   are the causes of various unwanted consequences for the relevant public
   authorities, as well as for citizens and companies as the end-users of
   that data.
   In this paper we present the results of an analysis of the status of the
   redundancy within the Croatian land administration-related registers.
   Following the analysis, suggestions are given on how the effectiveness
   of the analyzed registers can be increased by introducing a linking
   based on the Land Administration Domain Model(LADM).The proposed
   linkages were created by extending the Unified Modelling Language (UML)
   object classes of the LADM. The compliance analysis between registers
   and the LADM was conducted by using schema matching. Schema matching is
   a set of techniques used for comparing schemas (usually referred to as
   data models), and is well known within the database research domain. The
   results of the analysis were used to determine in which direction to go
   with extending of the LADM.
   All of the outputs of this research can be used to create a strategy for
   improving the effectiveness of the overall system of registers, which in
   turn should result in an overall economic progress of the country. (C)

Journal = {{MIDDLE EAST FERTILITY SOCIETY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Background: Repeated failure of in vitro fertilization treatment is
   frustrating to the patients and their clinicians. Various treatment
   plans and a change of protocol have been suggested for ``low
   responders{''}; however, patients who fail treatment repeatedly inspite
   of good quality embryos pose a special therapeutic challenge. Additional
   challenge would be imposed on that particular group when the local IVF
   regulating low does not permit surplus embryo freezing. Objective: To
   examine whether sequential transfer of embryos on day 3 and on day 5
   after ovum pick-up improves IVF/ET success rates in patients with
   repeated consecutive IVF failures ( ?, 3 trials) compared to day 3
   alone, with the background that local regulation prohibits embryo
   freezing. Study design: Randomized controlled study. Women scheduled for
   IVF/ET with repeated consecutive IVF failures ( ?, 3 trials) were
   randomized to either sequential transfer of embryos on day 3 and on day
   5 after ovum pick-up (Group I = 74) or conventional day 3 transfer
   (Group II = 73) as a control. The primary outcome measures were clinical
   pregnancy rate and implantation rate. The secondary outcome measures
   were ongoing pregnancy rate and early pregnancy loss. Results: Baseline
   and cycle characteristics were comparable in both groups. Clinical
   pregnancy rate (per embryo transfer) was significantly higher in
   sequential ET group (37. 8 A) compared to that in day 3 group (21.9 A)
   (P value <0.05). Also, implantation rate per embryos transferred) was
   significantly higher in sequential ET group (17.1\%) compared to that in
   control group (10.5\%) (P value <0.01). Similarly, ongoing pregnancy
   (per embryo transfer) was significantly higher in sequential ET group
   (33. 8\%) compared to that in day 3 group (19.2\%) (P value <0.05).
   Conclusions: Patients with repeated implantation failures, treatment
   with the sequential embryo transfer approach had significantly improved
   pregnancy outcomes compared to regular day 3 transfers. This approach
   would be particularly useful when neither oocyte freezing is a clinical
   option due to insufficient number of collected oocytes nor surplus
   embryo freezing is an option as the current local regulatory law
   prohibits it. (C) 2015 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier

Abstract = {{ObjectiveWe aimed to compare angiographic and clinical outcomes after
   the implantation of everolimus-eluting (EES) and sirolimus-eluting (SES)
   stents in patients with diabetes.
   BackgroundThere are limited data on long-term outcome after EES vs SES
   implantation in diabetic patients.
   MethodsWe randomized 213 patients with diabetes and coronary artery
   disease to EES (n=108) or SES (n=105) implantation. Angiographic
   follow-up was performed 10 months after the index procedure and all
   patients were followed clinically for 4 years. The primary endpoint was
   angiographic in-stent late luminal loss at 10-month follow-up. Secondary
   endpoints included angiographic restenosis rate, the need for target
   lesion revascularization (TLR) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE;
   defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, definite stent
   thrombosis, or TLR) at 4-year follow-up.
   ResultsAt 10-month angiographic follow-up, in-stent late lumen loss was
   0.200.53 mm and 0.11 +/- 0.49 mm (P=0.28), and angiographic restenosis
   rate was 3.8\% and 5.2\% (P=0.72) in the EES and SES groups,
   respectively. At 4-year clinical follow-up, MACE had occurred in 22
   (20.4\%) patients in the EES group and 25 (23.8\%) patients in SES group
   (HR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.47-1.49; P=0.55), with TLR performed in 6 (5.6\%)
   and 10 (9.5\%) patients in the two groups (HR 0.57, 95\% CI 0.21-1-58;

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe foxPSL, a fast, optimized and extended
   implementation of Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) based on the
   distributed graph processing framework SIGNAL/COLLECT. PSL is one of the
   leading formalisms of statistical relational learning, a recently
   developed field of machine learning that aims at representing both
   uncertainty and rich relational structures, usually by combining logical
   representations with probabilistic graphical models. PSL can be seen as
   both a probabilistic logic and a template language for hinge-loss Markov
   Random Fields, a type of continuous Markov Random fields (MRF) in which
   Maximum a Posteriori inference is very efficient, since it can be
   formulated as a constrained convex minimization problem, as opposed to a
   discrete optimization problem for standard MRFs. From the logical
   perspective, a key feature of PSL is the capability to represent soft
   truth values, allowing the expression of complex domain knowledge, like
   degrees of truth, in parallel with uncertainty.
   foxPSL supports the full PSL pipeline from problem definition to a
   distributed solver that implements the Alternating Direction Method of
   Multipliers (ADMM) consensus optimization. It provides a Domain Specific
   Language that extends standard PSL with a class system and existential
   quantifiers, allowing for efficient grounding. Moreover, it implements a
   series of configurable optimizations, like optimized grounding of
   constraints and lazy inference, that improve grounding and inference
   time.
   We perform an extensive evaluation, comparing the performance of foxPSL
   to a stateof-the-art implementation of ADMM consensus optimization in
   GraphLab, and show an improvement in both inference time and solution
   quality. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of the optimizations on the
   execution time and discuss the trade-offs related to each optimization.

Abstract = {{Neural stem cells (NSCs) as a heterogeneous multipotent and self-renewal
   population are found in different areas in the developing mammalian
   nervous system, as well as the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) and the
   hippocampus of the adult brain. NSCs can give rise to neurons,
   astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The aim of this study was to
   differentiate neural stem cells into noradrenergic-like cells in vitro.
   Neural stem cells were harvested from SVZ of newborn rat brains. The
   cells were cultured in DMEM12, B-27 supplemented with 20 ng/ ml (hFGF)
   and 20 ng/ ml (EGF) for 2 weeks. Neurospheres were differentiated in
   neurobasal medium, B-27 supplemented with BDNF (50 ng/ ml) and GDNF (30
   ng/ ml) for 3 and 5 days. Cell culture techniques and
   immunocytochemistry were applied to examine neurospheres and tyrosine
   hydroxylase positive cells. The number of neurites was counted 3 and 5
   days after the induction of differentiation. Nestin and Sox2 were
   expressed in NSCs and neurospheres. NSCs were differentiated into
   noradrenergic-like cells (NACs). Tyrosine hydroxylase was detected in
   these cells. The results of NSCs differentiation for 5 days culture had
   a significant decrease (P <= 0.05) in the number of TH positive cells
   with one or two neurite per cell, and a significant increase (P <= 0.05)
   in the number of TH positive cells with three, four or more neurites per
   cell, compared with 3 days culture. Based on these results, NSCs have
   the ability to differentiate into noradrenergic cells in the presence of
   BDNF and GDNF growth factors.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an optical breakdown in air induced by single and double
   nanosecond laser pulses was studied. A high power Nd:YAG laser beam was
   used for producing optical breakdown plasma in the air. The dynamics of
   breakdown plasma were studied using an optical probe beam. A portion of
   the laser beam was used, as the probe beam and was aligned to propagate
   (perpendicular to the pump beam) through the breakdown region. The
   transmission of the probe beam (through the breakdown region) was
   temporally measured for both single and double pulse irradiations. The
   results were used to describe the evolution of the induced plasma in
   both conditions. These results show that the plasma formation time and
   its absorptivity are strongly dependent on the single or double pulse
   configurations. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, DNA from 55 surface and river water samples, which were
   collected from some water sources of Tehran and the Guilan Province,
   Iran, were extracted and examined for Entamoeba spp. and Giardia lamblia
   by PCR and genotyping. Twenty-seven samples, which were concentrated
   using the immunomagnetic separation technology (IMS) method, were
   examined for Giardia alone. Twenty-eight samples, which were
   concentrated using the sucrose flotation (SF) method, were examined for
   both Giardia and Entamoeba species. The results showed that 27/55 (17/27
   and 10/28) (49 \%), 4 /28 (14.28 \%) and 3/28 (10.7 \%) of the samples
   were positive for Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba spp and mixed infections
   (Entamoeba spp. and Giardia spp.), respectively. Sixteen out of 55
   samples were negative. Entamoeba genus-specific PCR primers in
   single-round PCR were used to differentiate between the Entamoeba spp.
   (E. histolytica, E. dispar and E. moshkovskii). With respect to the 7
   samples that were positive for Entamoeba, (14.28 \%) 4 out of 28 were
   positive for E. moshkovskii, (7.14 \%), 2 out of 28 were positive for E.
   histolytica and (3.57 \%) 1 out of 28 was positive for E. dispar.
   Genus-specific PCR primers in a semi-nested PCR assay was performed to
   genotype Giardia species. Of the 27 samples that were positive for
   Giardia, 10 samples were sequences. All 10 successfully sequenced
   samples contained assemblage B of Giardia lamblia.
   This is first study to investigate the G. lamblia genotypes in the water
   supply of the Tehran and Guilan provinces, and it is the first study to
   investigate Entamoeba species in the water supplies of Iran. The
   investigated river water supplies, which are used for agriculture,
   camping and animal farming, were heavily contaminated by the human
   pathogenic Entamoeba and Giardia parasites. There is a potential risk of
   waterborne outbreaks in humans and animals.}},

Abstract = {{Pilot contamination occurs when cells simultaneously transmit the same
   pilot sequences, creating interference. Unsynchronizing the pilots can
   reduce pilot contamination, but it can produce data to pilot
   interference. In this paper, we investigate the impact of pilot
   contamination and other interference, namely data to pilot interference,
   on the performance of finite massive MIMO systems with synchronized and
   unsynchronized pilots. Two unsynchronized pilot schemes are considered.
   The first is based on an existing time-shifted pilot scheme, where
   pilots overlap with down-link data from nearby cells. The second
   time-shifted method overlaps pilots with uplink data from nearby cells.
   Results show that if there are small numbers of users, the first
   time-shifted method provides the best sum rate performance. However, for
   higher numbers of users, the second time-shifted method has advantage
   compared to other methods. We also show that time-synchronized pilot is
   not necessarily the worst case scenario in term of sum rate performance
   when shadowing effect are considered.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a fuzzy logic model of regenerative braking (FLmRB)
   for modeling EVs' regenerative braking systems (RBSs). The model has the
   vehicle's acceleration and jerk, and the road inclination as input
   variables, and the output of the FLmRB is the regeneration factor, i.e.
   the ratio of regenerative braking force to the total braking force. The
   regeneration factor expresses the percentage of energy recovered to the
   battery from braking. The purpose of the FLmRB development is to create
   realistic EV models using as least as possible manufacturers
   intellectual property data, and avoiding the use of EV on-board sensors.
   To tune the model, real data was gathered from short and long-distance
   field tests with a Nissan LEAF and compared with two types of
   simulations, one using the proposed FLmRB, and the other considering
   that all the braking force/energy is converted to electric current and
   returned back to charge the battery (100\% regeneration). The results
   show that the FLmRB can successfully infer the regenerative braking
   factor from the measured EV acceleration and jerk, and road inclination,
   without anylnowledge about the EV brake control strategy. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) will include billions of smart ``things{''}
   connected to the Web and characterized by sensing, actuating, and data
   processing capabilities. In this context, also known as Web of Things
   (WoT), the user should ideally be able to collect information provided
   by smart things, and to mash-up them to obtain value-added services.
   However, in the current solutions, the access to physical objects is
   poorly scalable and efficient, the communications are often
   unidirectional (from the devices to the users), and only tech-savvy
   people are able to develop mash-up applications. Based on these
   assumptions, we propose a software architecture to easily mash-up
   constrained application protocol (CoAP) resources. It is able to
   discover the available devices and to virtualize them outside the
   physical network. These virtualizations are then exposed to the upper
   layers by a REpresentational State Transfer (REST) interface, so that
   the physical devices interact only with their own virtualization.
   Furthermore, the system provides simplified tools allowing the
   development of mash-up applications to different-skilled users. Finally,
   the architecture allows not only to monitor but also to control the
   devices, thus establishing a bidirectional communication channel. To
   evaluate the proposal, we deeply modify and integrate some existing
   software components to realize an instance of the architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Root system interactions and competition for resources are active areas
   of research that contribute to our understanding of how roots perceive
   and react to environmental conditions. Recent research has shown this
   complex suite of processes can now be observed in a natural environment
   (i.e. soil) through the use of X-ray microcomputed tomography (mu CT),
   which allows non-destructive analysis of plant root systems. Due to
   their similar X-ray attenuation coefficients and densities, the roots of
   different plants appear as similar greyscale intensity values in mu CT
   image data. Unless they are manually and carefully traced, it has not
   previously been possible to automatically label and separate different
   root systems grown in the same soil environment. We present a technique,
   based on a visual tracking approach, which exploits knowledge of the
   shape of root cross-sections to automatically recover from X-ray mu CT
   data three-dimensional descriptions of multiple, interacting root
   architectures growing in soil. The method was evaluated on both
   simulated root data and real images of two interacting winter wheat
   Cordiale (Triticumaestivum L.) plants grown in a single soil column,
   demonstrating that it is possible to automatically segment different
   root systems from within the same soil sample. This work supports the
   automatic exploration of supportive and competitive foraging behaviour
   of plant root systems in natural soil environments.}},

Journal = {{HERZ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1061-1069}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Eleven years after the publication of the first guidelines worldwide on
   pericardial diseases by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), the
   international expert group of the ESC has updated the original document
   of 28 pages with 275 references. The final version of the new guidelines
   is more voluminous with 44 pages of recommendations but only 233
   references. A continuing medical education (CME) certified update of the
   2004 guidelines was published in the journal Herz volume 7/2014. In
   comparison to 2004 the 2015 guidelines have remained virtually unchanged
   in the sections detailing diagnostics, differential diagnosis, pathology
   and pathophysiology. Substantial progress has been made in magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) of pericarditis and epicarditis and in the
   practically universal recommendation of colchicine for all forms of
   pericarditis and pericardial effusion, whether acute, chronic or
   recurrent. This can truly be called progress; however, little has
   changed since 2004 even in tertiary referral centers or universities
   with respect to the etiological classification of acute or recurrent
   forms of pericarditis or pericardial effusion. By classifying
   pericardial syndromes much too often as idiopathic when a malignant or
   bacterial cause has been excluded, the underlying cause is often
   overlooked. Standstill in diagnosis is in the end regress because we too
   often lag behind our actual diagnostic and interventional possibilities.}},

Title = {{Low frequency dynamics of the nitrogenase MoFe protein via femtosecond
   pump probe spectroscopy - Observation of a candidate promoting vibration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INORGANIC BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{153}},
Pages = {{128-135}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We have used femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy (FPPS) to study the
   FeMo-cofactor within the nitrogenase (N(2)ase) MoFe protein from
   Azotobacter vinelandii. A sub-20-fs visible laser pulse was used to pump
   the sample to an excited electronic state, and a second sub-10-fs pulse
   was used to probe changes in transmission as a function of probe
   wavelength and delay time. The excited protein relaxes to the ground
   state with a similar to 12 Ps time constant. With the short laser pulse
   we coherently excited the vibrational modes associated with the
   FeMo-cofactor active site, which are then observed in the time domain.
   Superimposed on the relaxation dynamics, we distinguished a variety of
   oscillation frequencies with the strongest band peaks at similar to 84,
   116, 189, and 226 cm(-1). Comparison with data from nuclear resonance
   vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) shows that the latter pair of signals
   comes predominantly from the FeMo-cofactor. The frequencies obtained
   from the FPPS experiment were interpreted with normal mode calculations
   using both an empirical force field (EFF) and density functional theory
   (DFT). The FPPS data were also compared with the first reported
   resonance Raman (RR) spectrum of the N(2)ase MoFe protein. This approach
   allows us to outline and assign vibrational modes having relevance to
   the catalytic activity of N(2)ase. In particular, the 226 cm(-1) band is
   assigned as a potential `promoting vibration' in the H-atom transfer (or
   proton-coupled electron transfer) processes that are an essential
   feature of N(2)ase catalysis. The results demonstrate that high-quality
   room-temperature solution data can be obtained on the MoFe protein by
   the FPPS technique and that these data provide added insight to the
   motions and possible operation of this protein and its catalytic
   prosthetic group. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing age, youth with disabilities are at risk for decreased
   participation in leisure activities, a key component for physical and
   mental health. This prospective study describes changes in leisure
   participation and leisure preferences from school-age to adolescence in
   children with cerebral palsy (CP). Participants were recruited at
   school-age (6-12 years) for a study on participation and reassessed for
   a second study on adolescents (12-19 years) if > 12 years. Thirty-eight
   children (24 males) with CP who could actively participate in the
   completion of the Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment
   (CAPE) and the Preferences for Activities of Children (PAC) comprised
   the sample. Average time between assessments was 5.0 +/- 1.3 years. Most
   children were ambulatory (32/38 Gross Motor Function Classification
   System I-II). In addition to the CAPE and PAC, children were evaluated
   using the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 and parents completed a
   socio-demographic questionnaire. Paired t-tests revealed a significant
   decline in leisure participation diversity and intensity (CAPE) for
   recreation (p < .0001), skill-based (p < .0001) and self-improvement (p
   < .05) activities, whereas social participation remained stable (p >
   .05). Diversity of active-physical activities increased modestly (p =
   .06) although intensity of participation in this activity domain
   decreased (p = .003). There was also a decline in enjoyment of leisure
   activities. Preferences for these leisure activities remained unchanged
   between school-age and adolescence, except for recreational activities.
   Gender, maternal education, family income and gross motor ability were
   not related to differences in CAPE/PAC scores with increasing age.
   Findings suggest that overtime, children with CP's participation in
   leisure activities diminishes, which is of concern to their functioning
   and well-being. Parents may be more involved in early childhood in
   facilitating participation whereas in adolescence, youth may be faced
   with more environmental barriers and a greater awareness of challenges
   to participation. Adolescents demonstrated a persisting desire to do
   these activities, challenging rehabilitation specialists to prioritize
   strategies to promote greater participation as children transition to
   adolescence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Variable efficiency of androgenesis remains a serious problem in many
   species of cereals. It is still unclear what makes certain genotypes
   more amenable to androgenesis than others. This study was undertaken to
   quantify the previously suspected advantage of winter barley genotypes
   over spring ones with regard to regeneration efficiency in anther
   culture. The material consisted of 40 barley hybrids originating from
   Polish breeding companies. The number of androgenic structures per 100
   anthers did not differ significantly between analysed groups (119 vs.
   152 non-significant), but the average regeneration of green plants per
   100 anthers was five times higher in winter genotypes (6.4 vs. 1.3). The
   incidence of albinism was lower for the winter than for the spring
   materials (70\% vs. 90\%), while the rate of spontaneous chromosome
   doubling was similar in both groups (58\% vs. 56\%). The results
   strongly support the notion that winter genotypes are more amenable to
   androgenesis and this may be a consequence of their better adaptation to
   stress conditions.}},

Title = {{Influence of laser alloying with boron and niobium on microstructure and
   properties of Nimonic 80A-alloy}},
Journal = {{OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{229-239}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Ni-base superalloys were widely used in aeronautics, chemical and
   petrochemical industries due to their high corrosion resistance, high
   creep and rupture strength at high temperature. However, these alloys
   were not considered for applications in which conditions of appreciable
   mechanical wear were predominant. The diffusion bonding provided
   suitable protection against wear. Unfortunately, this process required
   long duration and high temperature. In this study, instead of the
   diffusion process, the laser alloying with boron and niobium was used in
   order to produce the hard and wear resistant layer on Nimonic 80A-alloy.
   The laser-alloying was carried out as a two-step process. First, the
   external cylindrical surface of specimens was pre-placed with a paste
   containing boron and niobium. Then, the pre-placed coating and the thin
   surface layer of the substrate were re-melted by a laser beam. The high
   laser beam power (P=1.56 kW) and high averaging irradiance (E=49.66
   kW/cm(2)) provided the thick laser re-melted zone. The laser-bonded
   layers were significantly thicker (470 pm) in comparison with the layers
   obtained as a consequence of the diffusion bonding. Simultaneously, the
   high overlapping of multiple laser tracks (86\%) caused that the
   laser-alloyed layer was uniform in respect of the thickness. The
   produced layer consisted of nickel borides (Ni3B, Ni2B, Ni4B3, NiB),
   chromium borides (CrB, Cr2B), niobium borides (NbB2, NbB) and Ni-phase.
   The presence of hard borides caused the increase in microhardness up to
   1000 HV in the re-melted zone. However, the measured values were lower
   than those-characteristic of niobium borides, chromium borides and
   nickel borides. The presence of the soft Ni-phase in re-melted zone was
   the reason for such a situation. After laser alloying, the significant
   increase in abrasive wear resistance was also observed. The mass wear
   intensity factor, as well as the relative mass loss of the laser-alloyed
   specimens, was over 10 times smaller in comparison with untreated
   Nimonic 80A-alloy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-objective plasma reflectarray/transmitarray antenna which
   reflects/transmits the incident fields radiating from a feed antenna in
   different directions have been introduced using a single structure. An
   electronic beam steering is achieved using a DC applied voltage on the
   array elements. A 13 x 13 unit cell reflectarray/transmitarray antenna
   covering an area of 13.52 x 13.52 cm(2) is proposed. The dimensions of
   the unit cells are identical with different argon gas density according
   to the relative phases of the reflected/transmitted wave. Each unit cell
   consists of two plasma cylindrical ring tubes positioned along the top
   and bottom of a plasma square ground plane filled with argon gas. The
   reflectarray is designed for 19.39 GHz, and the transmitarray is
   operating at 19.75 GHz using a single structure. The plasma frequency of
   the argon gas is varied by changing the applied ionizing DC voltage at
   both ends of the dielectric cylinder. The gain and frequency bandwidth
   for the new configuration are presented. An electronic beam steering
   plasma transmitarray antenna from -30A degrees to +30A degrees is
   introduced. The radiation characteristics of the
   reflectarray/transmitarray are investigated. A compromise between the
   reflectarray/ transmitarray efficiency and the multi-objective operation
   of the single structure have been introduced. A full-wave analysis using
   the finite integration technique (FIT) is applied.}},

   Results. Seventeen patients were placed into the group with hip
   dysfunction, and 54 into the group without hip dysfunction. The group
   with hip dysfunction had a higher average age (P = .026), weight (P =
   .029), and height (P = .019) than the group without hip dysfunction.
   There was also a higher prevalence of hip trauma (P = .05) and pain (P =
   .00). The study demonstrated that hip dysfunction negatively influenced
   quality of life in the physical activity (P = .11) and psychosocial (P =

Title = {{Aggregate capacity planning for elective surgeries: A bi-objective
   optimization approach to balance patients waiting with healthcare costs}},
Journal = {{OPERATIONS RESEARCH FOR HEALTH CARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{3-13}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The usual bottleneck resource in a healthcare chain is the operating
   room (OR) which has to be scheduled in advance for different elective
   surgeries. With an ever growing demand, the treatment capacity has
   lagged behind resulting in the queuing up of patients for their turns to
   undergo the elective surgery commonly referred to as the `waiting
   lists'. The last two decades have seen a grown emphasis for reducing the
   number of patients in the waiting lists and an important public policy
   tool to tackle this has been some form of `maximum waiting time
   guarantee'. The waiting time guarantees are backed with additional
   resources making it an effective policy tool in restricting the patients
   waiting times. But, the additional funding also increases the healthcare
   expenditure which shows that the healthcare capacity planning is faced
   with competing objectives. This study uniquely formulates and solves a
   bi-objective healthcare aggregate capacity planning problem to
   simultaneously minimize the number of patients waiting for an elective
   surgery and the associated costs. The multi-objective combinatorial
   optimization problem of allocating the Operating Room (OR) capacity to
   different surgical specialties is solved by the Non Dominated Sorting
   Genetic Algorithm (NSGA II). This gives a range of Pareto plans that
   have important managerial repercussions because it may help set and
   analyze the impact of various waiting time guarantees. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We propose a new tandem pumping scheme in three-level rare-earth-doped
   optical fibers, where energy storage in a pump fiber laser enables much
   shorter (similar to 500 ns) pump pulses than is possible with pulsed
   diode laser pumping. This has the effect of reducing the time during
   which the final amplifier has high inversion and, hence, reduces the
   amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) when compared with continuous wave
   (CW) tandem pumping. We simulate the gain and ASE dynamics in a
   pulse-pumped Yb-doped fiber amplifier and show that the ratio of
   amplified signal to ASE background can be improved by up to two orders
   of magnitude over a large range of pulse energies compared with CW
   tandem pumping. Sub-microsecond pulsed tandem pumping offers a
   relatively straightforward, as yet experimentally untried, way to
   substantially reduce undesirable ASE compared with the levels in
   diode-pumped fiber amplifiers.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers often want to examine 2 comorbid conditions simultaneously.
   One strategy to do so is through the use of parallel latent growth curve
   modeling (LGCM). This statistical technique allows for the simultaneous
   evaluation of 2 disorders to determine the explanations and predictors
   of change over time. Additionally, a piecewise model can help identify
   whether there are more than 2 growth processes within each disorder
   (e.g., during a clinical trial). A parallel piecewise LGCM was applied
   to self-reported attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and
   self- reported substance use symptoms in 303 adolescents enrolled in
   cognitive- behavioral therapy treatment for a substance use disorder and
   receiving either oral- methylphenidate or placebo for ADHD across 16
   weeks. Assessing these 2 disorders concurrently allowed us to determine
   whether elevated levels of 1 disorder predicted elevated levels or
   increased risk of the other disorder. First, a piecewise growth model
   measured ADHD and substance use separately. Next, a parallel piecewise
   LGCM was used to estimate the regressions across disorders to determine
   whether higher scores at baseline of the disorders (i.e., ADHD or
   substance use disorder) predicted rates of change in the related
   disorder. Finally, treatment was added to the model to predict change.
   While the analyses revealed no significant relationships across
   disorders, this study explains and applies a parallel piecewise growth
   model to examine the developmental processes of comorbid conditions over
   the course of a clinical trial. Strengths of piecewise and parallel
   LGCMs for other addictions researchers interested in examining dual
   processes over time are discussed.}},

   possible asexual reproduction by caducous leaves. We differentiate the
   Rovno fossil from morphologically similar species in Baltic or

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims to investigate quasi real-time ZIP load models for new
   Smart Grid-based Volt-VAR Optimization (VVO) techniques. As recent VVO
   solutions are able to perform in quasi real-time using Advanced Metering
   Infrastructure (AMI) data, more accurate load modeling could give
   distribution network operators and/or planners more precise Conservation
   Voltage Regulation (CVR) and energy saving values at each operating time
   stage. Furthermore, more accurate load modeling of each quasi real-time
   stage could improve VVO efficiency. As type, amount and operating time
   of each residential appliance varies throughout a day, this paper aims
   to discover ZIP load model of each quasi real-time stage separately
   through disaggregated data (i.e. decomposing residential load
   consumption into home appliance consumptions). This paper shows that the
   energy conservation achieved by CVR operation through presented quasi
   real-time ZIP load modeling could lead AMI-based VVO solutions to higher
   level of accuracy and data resolution compared with conventional
   techniques. Therefore, this paper primarily introduces a new quasi
   real-time AMI-based VVO engine. Then, it investigates ZIP load model of
   each quasi real-time stage through statistical data to conserve energy
   consumption. To check the authenticity and the applicability of
   presented model in a whole system, 33-node distribution feeder is
   employed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, the author analyses and interprets the image of the
   cultural and the historical heritage of Dalmatia that Ivan Kukuljevic
   Sakcinski (1816-1889) created during his two visits to this region in
   mid sixth decade of the 19th century (in 1854 and 1856). The author's
   main thesis is that this image represented a significant change in the
   historiographic and historical-artistic interest for Dalmatian past and
   its monuments that had prevailed until that time. Kukuljevies biased
   treatment of the mediaeval period as the historical heritage deserving
   priority on the national level was placed in opposition to the long-time
   dominant notion of the cultural and historical identity of Dalmatia
   based on the Antiquity cult. The author places Kukuljevic's attempt to
   rename Dalmatian historical landscape to the cradle of Croatian
   mediaeval past into the context of the history of Croatian lands,
   emphasising thereby the striving for including Dalmatia into the process
   of Croatian national integration as crucial ideological motivation. By
   analysing Kukuljevies discourse, the newly awakened interest for the
   architectural heritage of Croatian mediaeval period is illustrated; it
   is further indicated to the changes in the evaluation of the monumental
   heritage, as well as to the expected, i.e. characteristic methodological
   mistakes. Having placed Kukuljevies approach to the cultural and
   historical identity of monuments into an adequate epistemological and
   historical context, the author confirms the importance of his
   contribution to the development of the historiographic and
   historical-artistic interest for the cultural and the historical
   heritage of Dalmatia.}},

Abstract = {{Resonant dc-dc converters have found increasing application in industry
   in recent times. Yet, the methods of dynamical analysis and parameter
   design for this kind of system are not well developed. The averaging
   method cannot be used in such converters as the small-ripple assumption
   does not hold. The sampled-data model, which seeks to obtain a closed
   form expression of the state at a clock instant in terms of that at the
   previous clock instant, also becomes unwieldy for converters with many
   topological modes - a condition prevailing in all resonant converters.
   In this study the authors show that the Filippov method can be
   effectively applied for accurate s-domain small signal analysis as well
   as time domain stability analysis by locating the stability boundaries
   in the paramater space for such systems. The authors apply this method
   to three classes of resonant converters - the switch resonant converter,
   the resonant transition converter and the load resonant converter - and
   present the mechanisms by which these converters may lose stability as
   the parameters are varied. The theoretical results corresponding to the
   resonant transition converter are validated experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in muscle size and strength are influenced by the mechanical
   and metabolic stresses imposed by resistance training. Mechanical stress
   is induced by the use of high-intensity training and it is believed it
   activates a larger percentage of muscle fibers. Conversely, metabolic
   stress is generated by high training volumes with moderate intensities
   using short rest intervals. This training paradigm results in greater
   fatigue and potentially stimulates a greater anabolic hormone response
   to exercise. Although evidence exists for both strategies, it still
   remains inconclusive whether one training paradigm is more advantageous
   than the other regarding muscle hypertrophy development. In untrained
   adults, the novelty of most resistance training programs may be
   sufficient to promote hypertrophy and strength gains, whereas greater
   training intensity may be more beneficial for trained adults. However,
   the body of well-designed research in this advanced population is
   limited. Therefore, the purpose of this brief review is to discuss the
   merits and limitations of the current evidence.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been greater interest in the Hyper spectral (HS)
   sensing technology as the information that resides in the HS spectral
   domain provides significant advantages over the traditional Multi
   spectral images. The inherent tradeoff between the spectral and spatial
   resolutions has resulted in the development of remote sensing systems
   that include fusion of Hyper spectral image and Multi spectral image
   taken over the same image scene. In this proposed work Matrix
   Factorization (MF) Un mixing based fusion method is used for the fusion
   of the HS image and the MS image to produce a fused image data that will
   be enhanced in terms of its both spatial and spectral qualities which in
   turn contributes for the accurate identification and classification of
   various materials in the observed image scene. This algorithm is very
   straight forward and easy to implement owing to its simple update rules.
   The effectiveness of the proposed fusion technique for fusion of HS
   image and MS image over the other traditional fusion techniques like
   wavelet based fusion and IHS fusion, is analyzed in terms of the spatial
   and spectral performance metrics.}},

Abstract = {{In 2012, the College of American Pathologists and American Society for
   Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology published the LAST recommendations for
   histopathology reporting of human papilloma virus-related squamous
   lesions of the lower anogenital tract, including the use of a 2-tier
   nomenclature (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/high-grade
   squamous intraepithelial lesion {[}LSIL/HSIL]) and expanded use of the
   biomarker p16 to classify equivocal lesions as either precancer (HSIL)
   or low-grade lesions (LSIL)/non-human papilloma virus changes. We aimed
   to determine (1) the frequency with which the poorly reproducible
   diagnosis of intermediate-grade (-IN 2) lesion in the lower anogenital
   tract would be downgraded on the basis of p16 results, and (2) whether
   p16 status was predictive of subsequent higher-grade lesions. A total of
   200 specimens diagnosed as an intermediate-grade (-IN 2) lesion of the
   cervix (168), vagina (2), vulva (2), and anus (28) were reviewed and
   immunostained for p16. Slides were independently reviewed by 2
   pathologists, with discrepant p16 interpretations adjudicated by a third
   pathologist. Of the 200 cases, 32\% were negative for p16. Among the 166
   patients with subsequent pathology (including 131 excisions), 26.2\% of
   p16-positive cases versus 4.4\% of p16-negative cases were associated
   with a subsequent diagnosis of HSIL (-IN 3) or worse (P=0.002).
   Reproducibility of the biopsy diagnosis was fair, with no significant
   difference with the addition of p16 or using 2 versus 3 tiers. In 11.5\%
   of cases, there was discordance in p16 interpretation ( 0.735, good
   agreement). The results indicate that using the Lower Anogenital
   Squamous Terminology recommendations would result in approximately one
   third of equivocal (-IN 2) diagnoses being downgraded to LSIL over 1
   year in a busy academic practice. The significant association of p16
   expression with a higher risk for HSIL on a subsequent specimen suggests
   that use of p16 to adjudicate equivocal (-IN 2) diagnoses in lower
   anogenital tract specimens as either LSIL or HSIL would likely predict
   lesion grade more accurately and avoid unnecessary excisional
   procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Four turmeric flour fractions (F1, F2, F3, and F4) were produced from
   the turmeric dye extraction residue by wet milling and sieving for film
   production. F2, which presented the lowest lignocellulosic and the
   highest starch content, provided the best material for film production.
   The main objectives of the present study were (i) to evaluate the effect
   of heating temperature (T) and pH on the mechanical and functional
   properties of F2 film plasticized with glycerol, and (ii) to optimize
   the process conditions (T, pH) by response surface method and
   multi-response analyses. Higher T (>90 degrees C) and alkaline pH
   produced a denser and mechanically stronger polymer matrix and more
   soluble film. In contrast, less soluble films were produced at
   intermediate T and pH. The effect of T and pH on the mechanical
   properties and solubility of turmeric films is associated with starch
   gelatinization and protein solubilization and denaturation. High T
   produced loss of the curcuminoids and antioxidant activity of turmeric
   films. The optimal conditions were T of 85.1 degrees C and pH of 8.1.
   These conditions yielded films with high mechanical strength (9 MPa),
   low solubility (37\%), and low water vapor permeability (0.352 g mm
   h(-1) m(-2) kPa(-1)). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The metavolcanic rocks of the Paleo-Mesoarchean Older Metamorphic Group
   (OMG) from Jagannathpur area of the Singhbhum Craton occur as enclaves
   within the Singhbhum granites (SBG). The primary mineralogical
   composition of these rocks has been overprinted by
   plagioclase-chlorite-tremolite-actinolite assemblage reflecting lower to
   medium greenschist fades metamorphism. Disseminated sulphides and minor
   amount of chromite are present as opaque phases. Clinopyroxene
   compositions correspond to augite. Major, trace and rare earth element
   compositions of these rocks are characterized by high Mg\# (80-82), MgO
   (30.6-32.9 wt.\%), Ni (490-1262 ppm) and Cr (2404-4385 ppm) contents,
   high Al2O3/TiO2 (49-67), Zr/Hf (10-100) ratios with low TiO2 (0.1-0.2
   wt.\%), Zr (1.0-3.1 ppm) contents, (La/Sm)N >1 and (Gd/Yb)(N) <1. These
   geochemical features in conjunction with distinct negative Nb, Ta, Zr,
   Hf and Ti anomalies on N-MORB normalized multi-element diagram, relative
   enrichment in LILE and La collectively attest to boninitic signatures
   and magma generation in an intraoceanic subduction zone setting. These
   boninites are associated with low Ti island arc tholeiites (IAT) that
   have geochemical characteristics inherited from subduction zone
   processs. Relative MREE depletion in the OMG boninites compared to LREE
   and HREE is reflected by their high ((La/Sm)N = 0.7-6.7) and low
   (Gd/Yb)N = 0.4-0.6) ratios. These REE signatures corroborate a
   multi-stage petrogenetic process involving a refractory mantle source
   that was previously depleted by melt extraction episodes and
   subsequently enriched by subduction-related slab-dehydration process.
   The LILE and LREE replenishment of the refractory mantle wedge is
   attributed to influx of slab-derived hydrous fluids that lowered the
   solidus temperature and triggered partial melting of mantle wedge at
   shallow level under hydrous conditions. A mantle domain of spinel
   peridotite composition has been inferred for partial melting and
   generation of magmas parental to OMG boninites and IAT. The PGE
   chemistry of the studied boninites and IAT, marked by higher Pd and
   Pd/Jr over lower Pt and Pt/Pd and S-undersaturated nature attest to
   fluid-fluxed metasomatism of mantle wedge and sulphide retention in the
   residual mantle due to high fluid pressure and high degree of mantle
   melting at shallow depth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of border security is a notion that the US has pursued in
   earnest since September 11, 2001 and continues to be a focus for many
   Americans. This topic is assuredly going to rise once again as we near
   our 2016 national elections and the complex, often emotional issue, will
   take center stage as a heavily discoursed issue. Although there have
   been significant gains in how we enforce our international borders,
   there is wide disagreement on the success we have had with our border
   security efforts. Performance measures for border security are not
   always clear but there is a mosaic listing of outputs that suggest that
   border enforcement efforts have been successful. Unfortunately, we have
   failed to clearly delineate what successful border security efforts look
   like and before the nation, once again, makes a significant investment
   in resources we should start with the notion of defining successful
   border security.}},

Title = {{Repeated Moderate Noise Exposure in the Rat-an Early Adulthood Noise
   Exposure Model}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the effects of varying intensity levels
   of repeated moderate noise exposures on hearing. The aim was to define
   an appropriate intensity level that could be repeated several times
   without giving rise to a permanent hearing loss, and thus establish a
   model for early adulthood moderate noise exposure in rats. Female
   Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to broadband noise for 90 min, with a
   50 \% duty cycle at levels of 101, 104, 107, or 110 dB sound pressure
   level (SPL), and compared to a control group of non-exposed animals.
   Exposure was repeated every 6 weeks for a maximum of six repetitions or
   until a permanent hearing loss was observed. Hearing was assessed by the
   auditory brainstem response (ABR). Rats exposed to the higher
   intensities of 107 and 110 dB SPL showed permanent threshold shifts
   following the first exposure, while rats exposed to 101 and 104 dB SPL
   could be exposed at least six times without a sustained change in
   hearing thresholds. ABR amplitudes decreased over time for all groups,
   including the non-exposed control group, while the latencies were
   unaffected. A possible change in noise susceptibility following the
   repeated moderate noise exposures was tested by subjecting the animals
   to high-intensity noise exposure of 110 dB for 4 h. Rats previously
   exposed repeatedly to 104 dB SPL were slightly more resistant to
   high-intensity noise exposure than non-exposed rats or rats exposed to
   101 dB SPL. Repeated moderate exposure to 104 dB SPL broadband noise is
   a viable model for early adulthood noise exposure in rats and may be
   useful for the study of noise exposure on age-related hearing loss.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. The early acceleration of stellar winds in massive stars is poorly
   constrained. The scattering of hard X-ray photons emitted by the pulsar
   in the high-mass X-ray binary Vela X-1 can be used to probe the stellar
   wind velocity and density profile close to the surface of its supergiant
   companion HD 77581.
   Methods. We built a high signal-to-noise and high resolution hard X-ray
   lightcurve of Vela X-1 measured by Swift/BAT over 300 orbital periods of
   the system and compared it with the predictions of a grid of
   hydrodynamic simulations.
   Results. We obtain very good agreement between observations and
   simulations for a narrow set of parameters, implying that the wind
   velocity close to the stellar surface is twice higher than usually
   assumed with the standard beta law. Locally a velocity gradient of beta
   similar to 0.5 is favoured. Even if still incomplete, hydrodynamic
   simulations successfully reproduce several observational properties of
   Vela X-1.}},

   identify and distinguish oligostilbene diastereoisomers. A polyphenolic
   extract from Neobalanocarpus heimii known to be rich in oligostilbenes

   oligostilbenes were isolated from this extract on a fully automated
   semi-preparative HPLC system. Out of these, two pairs of dimers, one
   pair of trimers, two pairs of tetramers and a group of four tetramers
   with similar skeleton were identified as diastereoisomers. Their
   structures and configurations were established by spectroscopic methods.
   All isolated compounds were subjected to an LC-MS/MS to study their
   fragmentation patterns. The experiments were performed on a liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with electrospray-ionization
   (ESI) interface in positive mode. MS/MS spectra of each pure compound
   were recorded by direct infusion in identical conditions and their

Abstract = {{Among the different food industries, fresh-cut produce manufacturing is
   one of the major water-intensive, due to the huge consumption of potable
   water to perform washing operations required to guarantee the safety and
   quality of the product. Reducing the water footprint of washing is thus
   a challenge for fresh-cut industries and food researchers. This review
   paper examines the current status of the water resource management in
   the fresh-cut industry and critically describes a comprehensive approach
   to the improvement of the water use efficiency by implementing
   strategies of water recirculation, reuse and recycling. In particular,
   advantages and limitations of chlorine and chlorine-free disinfectants
   to reduce water turnover in washing tanks were considered. In addition,
   particular attention was focussed on innovative technological solutions,
   based on either physical or chemical stresses, which could be exploited
   individually or in combination to treat wastewater deriving from
   fresh-cut washing and allow its recycling within the processing plant.

Abstract = {{Strain TCF032-E4 was isolated from a traditional Chinese fermented
   radish. It shares >99\% 16S rRNA sequence identity with L. plantarum, L.

   galactose, glucose, fructose, mannose, mannitol, N-acetylglucosamine,
   amygdalin, arbutin, salicin, cellobiose, maltose, lactose, melibiose,
   trehalose and gentiobiose. It cannot ferment sucrose, which can be used
   by L. pentosus, L. paraplantarum, L. fabifermentans, L. xiangfangensis
   and L. mudanjiangensis, as well as most of the L. plantarum strains
   (88.7\%). TCF032-E4 cannot grow at temperature above 32 degrees C. This
   strain shares 78.2-83.6\% pheS (phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase alpha
   subunit) and 89.5-94.9\% rpoA (RNA polymerase alpha subunit) sequence
   identity with L. plantarum, L. pentosus, L. paraplantarum, L.
   fabifermentans, L. xiangfangensis and L. mudanjiangensis. These results
   indicate that TCF032-E4 represents a distinct species. This hypothesis
   was further confirmed by whole-genome sequencing and comparison with
   available genomes of related species. The draft genome size of TCF032-E4
   is approximately 2.9 Mb, with a DNA G + C content of 43.5 mol\%. The
   average nucleotide identity (ANI) between TCF032-E4 and related species

Abstract = {{A novel method based on electrooculography (EOG) has been introduced in
   this work to study the decision-making process. An experiment was
   designed and implemented wherein subjects were asked to choose between
   two items from the same category that were presented within a limited
   time. The EOG and voice signals of the subjects were recorded during the
   experiment. A calibration task was performed to map the EOG signals to
   their corresponding gaze positions on the screen by using an artificial
   neural network. To analyze the data, 16 parameters were extracted from
   the response time and EOG signals of the subjects. Evaluation and
   comparison of the parameters, together with subjects' choices, revealed
   functional information. On the basis of this information, subjects
   switched their eye gazes between items about three times on average. We
   also found, according to statistical hypothesis testing-that is, a t
   test, t(10) = 71.62, SE = 1.25, p < .0001-that the correspondence rate
   of a subjects' gaze at the moment of selection with the selected item
   was significant. Ultimately, on the basis of these results, we propose a
   qualitative choice model for the decision-making task.}},

Abstract = {{V2O5/WO3-TiO2 selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts with a V2O5
   loading of 1.7, 2.0, 2.3, 2.6, 2.9, 3.2 and 3.5 wt. \% were investigated
   in the fresh state and after hydrothermal aging at 600 degrees C for 16
   h. The catalysts were characterized by means of nitrogen physisorption,
   X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. In the fresh state,
   the SCR activity increased with increasing V loading. Upon aging, the
   catalysts with up to 2.3 wt. \% V2O5 exhibited higher NOx reduction
   activity than in the fresh state, while the catalysts with more than 2.6
   wt. \% V2O5 showed increasing deactivation tendencies. The observed
   activation and deactivation were correlated with the change of the VOx
   and WOx surface coverages. Only catalysts with a VOx coverage below 50\%
   in the aged state did not show deactivation tendencies. With respect to
   tungsten, above one monolayer of WOx, WO3 particles were formed leading
   to loss of surface acidity, sintering, catalyst deactivation and early
   NH3 slip. An optimal compromise between activity and hydrothermal aging
   resistance could be obtained only with V2O5 between 2.0 and 2.6 wt. \%.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To review our experience with the diagnosis and treatment of
   irritant-induced paradoxical vocal fold motion disorder (IPVFMD).
   Study Design Retrospective chart review.
   Setting Tertiary academic referral center.
   Subjects and Methods Thirty-four cases that met IPVFMD criteria and 76
   cases of non-IPVFMD were selected from a database of patients with
   paradoxical vocal fold motion disorderthe diagnosis of which was made on
   the basis of flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy and augmented by an odor
   challenge. Clinical charts were reviewed to document history of
   environmental allergies, pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux,
   psychiatric disorder, fibromyalgia, tobacco use, alcohol use, dysphonia,
   cough, dysphagia, and treatment outcomes.
   Results There were no statistical differences between the IPVFMD and
   non-IPVFMD groups. Of the patients who were assigned and attended
   laryngeal control therapy, 13 (65\%) reported improvement of symptoms.
   Symptom improvement increased to 100\% in those patients who attended at
   least 2 laryngeal control therapy sessions.
   Conclusions IPVFMD should be considered in patients presenting with
   respiratory symptoms after irritant exposure. Sensitivity of diagnosis
   can be improved via a standardized approach consisting of a careful
   history and physical examination, including laryngoscopy in the presence
   of triggers. Laryngeal control therapy is a well-tolerated and effective
   method of managing IPVFMD.}},

Title = {{Development and transferability of a nitrogen dioxide land use

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{696-704}},

Abstract = {{When measurements or other exposure models are unavailable, air
   pollution concentrations could be estimated by transferring land-use
   regression (LUR) models from other areas. No studies have looked at
   transferability of LUR models from regions to cities. We investigated
   model transferability issues. We developed a LUR model for 2010 using
   annual average nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations retrieved from 47
   regulatory stations of the Veneto region, Northern Italy. We applied
   this model to 40 independent sites in Verona, a city inside the region,
   where NO2 had been monitored in the European Study of Cohorts for Air
   Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) during 2010. We also used this model to
   estimate average NO2 concentrations at the regulatory network in 2008,
   2009 and 2011. Of 33 predictor variables offered, five were retained in
   the LUR model (R-2 = 0.75). The number of buildings in 5000 m buffers,
   industry surface area in 1000 m buffers and altitude, mainly
   representing large-scale air pollution dispersion patterns, explained
   most of the spatial variability in NO2 concentrations (R-2 = 0.68),
   while two local traffic proxy indicators explained little of the
   variability (R-2 = 0.07). The performance of this model transferred to
   urban sites was poor overall (R-2 = 0.18), but it improved when only
   predicting inner-city background concentrations (R-2 = 0.52).
   Recalibration of LUR coefficients improved model performance when
   predicting NO2 concentrations at the regulatory sites in 2008, 2009 and
   2011 (R-2 between 0.67 and 0.80). Models developed for a region using
   NO2 regulatory data are unable to capture small-scale variability in NO2
   concentrations in urban traffic areas. Our study documents limitations
   in transferring a regional model to a city, even if it is nested within
   that region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a procedure that delivers a single
   large radiation dose to a well-defined target. Here, we describe a
   frameless SRS technique suitable for intracranial targets in canines.
   Medical records of dogs diagnosed with a primary intracranial tumour by
   imaging or histopathology that underwent SRS were retrospectively
   reviewed. Frameless SRS was used successfully to treat tumours in 51
   dogs with a variety of head sizes and shapes. Tumours diagnosed included
   38 meningiomas, 4 pituitary tumours, 4 trigeminal nerve tumours, 3
   gliomas, 1 histiocytic sarcoma and 1 choroid plexus tumour. Median
   survival time was 399 days for all tumours and for dogs with
   meningiomas; cause-specific survival was 493 days for both cohorts.
   Acute grade III central nervous system toxicity (altered mentation)
   occurred in two dogs. Frameless SRS resulted in survival times
   comparable to conventional radiation therapy, but with fewer acute
   adverse effects and only a single anaesthetic episode required for
   therapy.}},

Abstract = {{We study decision problems inwhich consequences of the various
   alternative actions depend on states determined by a generative
   mechanism representing some natural or social phenomenon. Model
   uncertainty arises because decision makers may not know this mechanism.
   Two types of uncertainty result, a state uncertainty within models and a
   model uncertainty across them. We discuss some two-stage static decision
   criteria proposed in the literature that address state uncertainty in
   the first stage and model uncertainty in the second (by considering
   subjective probabilities over models). We consider two approaches to the
   Ellsberg-type phenomena characteristic of such decision problems: a
   Bayesian approach based on the distinction between subjective attitudes
   toward the two kinds of uncertainty; and a non-Bayesian approach that
   permits multiple subjective probabilities. Several applications are used
   to illustrate concepts as they are introduced.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Postprandial lipemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular
   disease. The potential impacts of the type/nature of dietary protein on
   postprandial lipemia and associated dysregulations have been
   insufficiently investigated.
   Objective: We investigated the postprandial effect of including in a
   high-fat meal some milk protein fractions that markedly differ in their
   physicochemical properties and composition {[}either casein (CAS), whey
   protein (WHE), or a-lactalbumin-enriched whey protein (LAC)].
   Methods: The protein fractions were incorporated as 15\% energy in a
   high-fatmeal in a W3-period, crossover postprandial study of 10 healthy
   overweight men with an elevated waist circumference (>94 cm). We
   measured postprandial changes in plasma lipids, amino acids, glucose,
   and oxidative stress markers, vascular function (using pulse contour
   analysis), and low-grade inflammation (using plasma markers). We also
   characterized in vitro the meal structures, including the size of the
   fat globule, and possible changes during digestion.
   Results: The type of protein did not affect postprandial plasma glucose,
   amino acids, insulin, or nonesterified fatty acids, but, compared with
   WHE and LAC, which did not differ, CAS markedly reduced postprandial
   triglycerides (TGs), achieving a 22 +/- 10\% reduction in the 6-h area
   under the curve (P < 0.05). Similar trends were shown for plasma
   chylomicrons {[}apolipoprotein (apo) B-48; P < 0.05]. However, there
   were no significant differences between the meals regarding postprandial
   oxidative stress (plasma hydroperoxides and malondialdehyde),
   endothelial dysfunction (salbutamol-induced changes in pulse contour
   analysis), or low-grade inflammation. In vitro studies showed that when
   the pH of the meal decreased to stomach pH values, the reduction in the
   solubility of casein resulted in a phase separation between fat and
   protein, whereas the proteins in the other meals remained suspended with
   fat globules.
   Conclusion: In healthy overweight men, casein has specific physical
   interactions with fat that affect postprandial TGs, leading to the
   formation of fewer chylomicrons or an increase in chylomicron clearance.

Abstract = {{This article defines and calls attention to the public sociology of
   religion as a robust stream of scholarship with potential to increase
   the sociology of religion subfield's relevance and impact in sociology

   between sociologists and diverse publics, informs normative perspectives
   on public problems involving religion, and investigates the place and
   practice of religion in civil society. I discuss my dissertation
   research-a national, multisite ethnography of new evangelical strategies
   for engaging the public and the poor in Portland, Los Angeles, Atlanta,
   and Boston-as a case study in the public sociology of religion,
   considering the enactment and normative valence of new evangelical
   approaches to participation, presence, and power in American public
   life. I conclude with some final observations concerning how a robust
   public sociology of religion addresses perceived problems of
   marginality, isolation, and theoretical sterility within the subfield.}},

Abstract = {{In this study a configurational approach was used to examine the
   organizational slack and innovation relationship. Utilizing a sample of
   437 manufacturing firms and multiple measures of firm innovation we
   identified distinct configurations of slack and found significant
   innovation differences between them. The results from our analyses
   demonstrate that configurations with moderately high combined levels of
   internal slack (available and recoverable slack) and moderately high
   levels of potential slack produced higher levels of innovation.
   Conversely, configurations with low to moderately low levels of each
   type of slack produced the lowest levels of innovation. Our findings
   also indicate that alternative configurations of slack can result in
   similar levels of innovation suggesting the existence of equifinality in
   this relationship. Overall, our findings suggest that the slack and
   innovation relationship is more complex than has been accounted for in
   previous research. The implications of these findings are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective. The aim of this study was to investigate whether employees'
   perception of the knowledge-sharing culture in an organization varies
   with demographic characteristics, and whether there are interaction
   effects between different demographic characteristics.
   Methods. The survey method was used. Questionnaires were distributed to
   500 employees in 75 randomly selected companies in Kuwait; 386 valid
   responses were collected and analyzed.
   Results. The results revealed that perception of knowledge sharing
   culture in these organizations was related to age, experience, position,
   and sector of employment (public versus private). Position had a
   positive and direct effect on the perception of knowledge sharing
   culture. There was interaction between education and gender, sector and
   gender, and education and sector in their effect on perception of
   knowledge sharing culture.
   Contributions. The results of the study would contribute to
   decision-making and policy formulation aimed at fostering knowledge
   sharing in organizations.}},

Abstract = {{Background: To date in Germany there exist only two questionnaires in
   the physiotherapeutic practice which collect elbow-specific complaints
   from the patients' perspective and measure therapeutic success.
   Perspective: The aim of this study was therefore the translation of the
   English ``Oxford Elbow Score{''} (OES) into German.
   Method: The OES was translated into German on the basis of two
   guidelines for cultural adaptation. Two independent forward translations
   were generated and compared with each other. Afterwards two independent
   forward translations were carried out followed by a review. The
   resulting questionnaire was tested qualitatively in two test stages each
   with five patients regarding comprehensibility and cultural adherence.
   Results: The OESwas translated to the German version ``Oxford Ellenbogen
   Bewertung{''} and adapted. Following the first pilot stage some minor
   changes were carried out. Re-examination during the second test stage
   superseded any further changes.
   Conclusion: An authorized OES version was successfully translated into
   German. Its quality criteria will be assessed in a subsequent study.}},

Journal = {{PREVENTIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{333-338}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background. Adults are recommended to engage in at least 150 min/week of
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (PA).
   Purpose. This study aimed to examine the level of compliance with PA
   recommendations among European adults.
   Methods. Using data from European Social Survey round 6, PA self-report
   data was collected from 52,936 European adults from 29 countries in
   2012. Meeting PA guidelines was assessed using World Health Organization
   criteria.
   Results. 61.47\% (60.77\% male, 62.05\% female) of European adults
   reported to be engaged in moderate to vigorous PA at least 30 min on 5
   or more days per week. The likelihood of achieving the PA recommended
   levels was higher among respondents older than 18-24. For those aged
   45-64 years the likelihood increased 65\% (OR = 1.65, 95\% CI:
   1.51-1.82, p < 0.001) and 112\% (OR = 2.12, 95\% CI: 1.94-2.32, p <
   0.001) for males and females, respectively. Those who were high school
   graduates were more likely to report achieving the recommended PA levels
   than those with less than high school education (males: OR = 1.19, 95\%
   CI: 1.12-1.27, p < 0.001; females: OR = 1.13, 95\% CI: 1.06-1.20, p <
   0.001).
   Conclusion. Although about 60\% of European adults reported achieving
   the recommended levels of PA, there is much room for improvement among
   European adults, particularly among relatively inactive subgroups. (C)

Abstract = {{Polyurethane (PUR) foam materials are widely used as cores in sandwich
   composites, for packing and cushioning. They are made of interconnected
   networks of solid struts and cell walls incorporating voids with
   entrapped gas. The main characteristics of foams are lightweight, high
   porosity, high crushability, and good energy absorption capacity.
   Fracture toughness in mixed mode loading is of particular interest
   because foam cracking weakens the structure's capacity for carrying
   loads.
   Present paper assesses the shear elastic (shear modulus) and mechanical
   (shear strength) properties of polyurethane foams. Also, three different
   types of specimens were used to determine mode I and mode II fracture
   toughness. The shear modulus, shear strength and fracture toughness
   increases with increasing foam density. Also the effect of loading
   direction and loading speed is investigated. The authors propose a
   micromechanical model to estimate fracture toughness based on the
   tensile strength of the solid material and the topology of the cellular
   structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this essay, I comment on Andrew Benjamin's recent book, Working with
   Walter Benjamin. I claim that in this book, Professor Benjamin has done
   a great deal to illuminate certain complicated aspects of Walter
   Benjamin's philosophy. In particular, I focus on his distinction between
   theology and religion, his treatment of divine violence and the ways
   that it differs from any human actions, and the nature of what Professor
   Benjamin calls counter-measures, that is measures which not only
   challenge but actually unmake certain aspects of our contemporary sense
   of reality and temporality.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: An adequate communication between levels of medical
   attention is the key point for optimal treatment and outcomes of the
   hypertensive population.
   Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the adequacy of the
   hypertensive patients derivation from Primary Care to Specialized Care.
   As secondary objectives, the information registered on the derivation
   report was assessed and concordance between derivation reason and final
   diagnosis was analysed.
   Design: This is an observational, descriptive, multicentre study.
   Site: Study conducted at the national level.
   Participants: Specialty Care Physicians receiving hypertensive patients
   referred from primary care.
   Principal measurements: On the baseline visit, the specialist physicians
   assessed the quality of the derivation records and attended the patient.
   After the study, final diagnosis and treatment is suggested on the final
   visit.
   Results: 1769 subjects were included, mean aged 62,4 (13,6) years, 45\%
   female. Time of diagnosis of hypertension was 8,0 (7,7) years. More than
   the half of the derivation records contained very good information
   (5,4\%; Cl 4,3-6,5) or sufficient (50,7\%; Cl 48,4-53,0). In 7,1\% (IC
   5,9-8,3) derivation cause was not specified. 74,7\% of the derivations
   were considered as appropriate, though 30\% were late. Concordance
   between derivation reasons and final diagnosis was low (kappa index
   0,208).
   Conclusions: A quarter of the hypertensive population is unnecessary
   derived to Secondary Care and 30\% of the appropriately derived was
   late. We should improve the interrelation of attention in the
   hypertension and cardiovascular area between the both attention levels.

Abstract = {{The heart is one of the most frequently affected organs in sepsis.
   Recent studies focused on lipopolysaccharide-induced mitochondrial
   dysfunction; however myocardial dysfunction is not restricted to
   gram-negative bacterial sepsis. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate circulating heparan sulfate (HS) as an endogenous danger
   associated molecule causing cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis.
   We used an in vitro model with native sera (SsP) and sera eliminated
   from HS (HS-free), both of septic shock patients, to stimulate murine
   cardiomyocytes. As determined by extracellular flux analyzing, SsP
   increased basal mitochondrial respiration, but reduced maximum
   mitochondrial respiration, compared with unstimulated cells (P<0.0001
   and P<0.0001, respectively). Cells stimulated with HS-free serum
   revealed unaltered basal and maximum mitochondrial respiration, compared
   with unstimulated cells (P=0.1174 and P=0.8992, respectively). Cellular
   ATP-level were decreased in SsP-stimulated cells but unaltered in cells
   stimulated with HS-free serum compared with unstimulated cells (P<0.0001
   and P=0.1593, respectively). Live-cell imaging revealed an increased
   production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in cells stimulated
   with SsP compared with cells stimulated with HS-free serum (P<0.0001).
   Expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR and
   PPAR) and their co-activators PGC-1, which regulate mitochondrial
   function, were studied using PCR. Cells stimulated with SsP showed
   downregulated PPARs and PGC-1 mRNA-levels compared with HS-free serum
   (P=0.0082, P=0.0128, and P=0.0185, respectively). Blocking Toll-like
   receptor 4 revealed an inhibition of HS-dependent downregulation of
   PPARs and PGC-1 (all P<0.0001). In conclusion, circulating HS in serum
   of septic shock patients cause cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction,
   suggesting that HS may be targets of therapeutics in septic
   cardiomyopathy.}},

Title = {{Everyday practices of ancestralization within an indigenous territory:
   The case of the Pewenche Community of Quinquen}},
Journal = {{REVISTA DE GEOGRAFIA NORTE GRANDE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{62}},
Pages = {{85-107}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article explores the ancestral dimension of the life in the
   pewenche community of Quinquen, in Southern Chile. It examines different
   social practices, in order to identify the plurality of form used by the
   community's inhabitants to ancestralize their territory. This process of
   ancestralization underlies various aspects of life in Quinquen and has
   become notable or even visible, both to the community and to outsiders.
   It is postulated that ancestralization of territory is a continuous
   process that is linked to the lifestyles of the families that compose
   the community, through links that keep the continuity of social
   relationships across time and space. The purpose of this is to
   contribute to the recognition of an indigenous geography embedded in the
   everyday life. Greater consideration of these aspects could contribute
   to a critical reflection on what it means to live in an indigenous
   community. But more importantly, it could contribute to understanding
   what it means to be pewenche today. The article is organized into three
   sections: the first analyzes the field of power relations, the second
   social structure, and the third strategies of territorial control.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{536}},

Abstract = {{A spatial analysis of hydrochemical data of groundwater and surface
   water was undertaken to identify groundwater-surface water connectivity
   in the headwaters of the Condamine River catchment, Southeast
   Queensland, Australia. An assessment of long-term hydrochemical and
   water level data supplemented by stable-and radioisotope measurements
   following a prolonged dry period dominated by baseflow, helped in
   determining patterns of interaction in different tributaries of the
   upper Condamine catchment. A conceptual hydrological model representing
   the major hydrochemical processes and their implications for
   stream-aquifer connectivity was developed and tested using multiple
   lines of evidence.
   The results of a multivariate statistical analysis highlight that there
   are two main regions with distinct hydrochemical facies (salinity,
   alkalinity, and predominant ions) in surface water. Geomorphology,
   geology, anthropogenic and climate influence were identified as the most
   relevant controlling factors of the spatial variability in water
   quality.
   Stable isotope data confirmed a clear evaporation trend in almost all
   surface water samples during baseflow conditions. Two water types can be
   identified and separated by the degree of evaporation and the proximity
   of one group to the local meteoric water line. The results confirm the
   discharge of groundwater from aquifers recharged by rainfall and located
   upstream of the surface water sampling sites.
   Overall, Rn-222 data show a trend of increased activity in surface water
   towards the upstream portions of these tributaries, validating the use
   of this tracer to estimate groundwater input to the local creeks. The
   proportion of groundwater contribution to stream flow calculated by
   Rn-222 and chloride mass balance is in agreement, and ranges between
   20-70\% in tributaries in the northern areas, and between 8-50\% in the
   upper reaches of the main river channel.
   This study shows the efficacy of an integrated approach combining
   long-term hydrochemical data interpreted via multivariate statistics,
   hydraulic water level data and stable and radiogenic isotope hydrology
   for the determination of groundwater-surface interactions in headwater
   catchments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work evaluated the adsorption performance of a commercial granular
   activated carbon (GAC) for three naphthenic acids (NAs) model compounds.
   In single-compound adsorption, the saturation capacity (q(m)) at pH 4
   was 452.6 mg/g (1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid) > 357.9 mg/g
   (2-naphthoic acid) > 317.7 mg/g (diphenylacetic acid). Of all model NAs,
   adsorption of 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid was the most negatively
   affected in multi-component adsorption at pH 4. The q(m) decreased
   significantly with increasing pH due to its effect on both carbon
   surface charge and dissociation of the NAs. An important finding was
   that the total amount of NAs adsorbed in multi-component adsorption at
   pH 4 (326 mg/g) was almost the same as that adsorbed at pH 8 (324 mg/g),
   indicating the potential of activated carbon adsorption for removal of

Abstract = {{The antioxidant activity and nutritional composition of four dehydrated
   soups (vegetables, meat, chicken and fish) packaged in four formats -
   carton, plastic, and aluminium bags (the last with and without modified
   atmosphere) - were evaluated during 12 months' storage. The results
   showed that all four soups had a good or very good antioxidant capacity
   as tested by the lipid peroxidation, deoxyribose, and Trolox equivalent
   antioxidant capacity (TEAC) tests. Of interest from a nutritional point
   of view was the finding that the lipid fraction of all the soups was
   below 1 \%. The sodium content of the four soups and their ingredients
   was also analysed. By modifying some of the ingredients, a 25 \%
   reduction in the sodium content of the soups was obtained, permitting
   them to be labelled as ``sodium reduced{''}. The monosodium glutamate
   (MSG) content of the reformulated soups (lower sodium content) was below
   levels permitted by European legislation.}},

Title = {{Do PT and APTT sensitivities to factors' deficiencies calculated by the
   H47-A2 2008 CLSI guideline reflect the deficiencies found in plasmas
   from patients?}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin
   time (APTT) sensitivity for detecting isolated factor deficiencies
   varies with different reagents and coagulometers. The Clinical and
   Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) H47A2 guideline proposed a method
   to calculate these sensitivities, but some inconsistency has been
   reported. This study aimed to calculate factor sensitivities using CLSI
   guideline and to compare them with those obtained from single
   factor-deficient patients' data.
   Methods: Different mixtures of normal pooled and deficient plasmas were
   prepared (<1IU/dL to 100 IU/dL) according to the CLSI H47A2 guideline.
   PT with rabbit brain (RB) and human recombinant (HR) thromboplastins,
   APTT and factors' activities were measured in an ACL TOP coagulometer.
   Sensitivities (maximum factor concentration that produces PT or APTT
   values out of the reference range) were calculated from mixtures and
   from patients with single-factor deficiencies: 17 factor FV, 36 FVII, 19
   FX, 39 FVIII, 15 FIX 15 FXI and 24 FXII.
   Results: PT sensitivity with RB was as follows: FV 38 and 59, FVII 35
   and 58, FX 56 and 64 IU/dL; PT sensitivity with HR was as follows: FV 39
   and 45, FVII 51 and 50, FX 33 and 61 IU/dL; and APTT sensitivity was as
   follows: FV 39 and 45, FX 32 and 38, FVIII 47 and 60, FIX 35 and 44, FXI
   33 and 43, FXII 37 and 46 IU/dL, respectively.
   Conclusions: Reagent-coagulometer combination has adequate sensitivities
   to factor deficiencies according to guideline recommendations (>30
   IU/dL). These should not be considered as actual sensitivities because
   those obtained by analysing patients' plasmas with single-factor
   deficiencies were higher for most factors and could induce
   misinterpretation of the basic coagulation test results.}},

Title = {{Use of nucleoside analogs in patients with chronic hepatitis B in Nepal:
   A prospective cohort study in a single hospital}},
Journal = {{HEPATOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{Aim: There still remain many concerns about the present status of
   antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B in developing countries in
   Asia, where the monitoring systems of virological markers have not been
   well established, despite the high prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
   infection. To investigate it in Nepal, this prospective cohort study was
   conducted at the Teaching Hospital of Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.
   Methods: From 2007 to 2012, 65 patients were consecutively enrolled, 44
   of whom received nucleoside analogs (NA), such as lamivudine (LMV),
   adefovir or tenofovir (TDF), on the decision of the local hepatologist.
   Virological determinations were performed in Japan, by using the
   serially collected serum samples at the Teaching Hospital. Statistical
   analysis was performed, using Mann-Whitney U-test or Fisher's exact
   test.
   Results: The younger, especially female patients of reproductive age
   were more frequently prescribed with these NA, and an increased
   preference for the use of TDF was observed over time. However, there was
   insufficient follow up of the NA-treated patients in this cohort, and
   not a few patients developed emergence of NA-resistant HBV: known
   resistance to LMV in 3 patients and incidental resistance to
   non-administrated NA in four patients.
   Conclusion: The results of the present study indicate that education for
   physicians as well as for infected patients regarding the proper use of
   NA, together with establishment of appropriate monitoring systems for
   virological markers, is warranted to prevent an increase in NA-resistant
   HBV infections in Nepal.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study a dispersive Euler-Poisson system in two

   zero-dispersion limit of the time-local weak solution. Since one may not
   use dispersive structure in the zero-dispersion limit, when reducing the
   regularity, lack of critical embedding H-1 subset of L-infinity becomes
   a bottleneck. We hence employ an estimate on the best constant of the
   Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality. By this argument, a reasonable
   convergence rate for the zero-dispersion limit is deduced with a slight
   loss. We also consider the semiclassical limit problem of the
   Schrodinger-Poisson system in two dimensions. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{The development and production of multiphase machines either generators

   output requires converter system such as ac-dc converters. In this
   paper, a fully controlled 10-pulse line commutated rectifier, suitable
   to be engaged with wind energy applications, fed from five-phase source
   is introduced. A shunt active power filter (APF) is used to improve
   power factor and supply current total harmonic distortion (THD).
   Compared to three-phase converters, 6-pulse or 12-pulse rectifiers, the
   10-pulse rectifier engaged with 5-phase source alleviate their drawbacks
   such as high dc ripples and no need for electric gear or phase shifting
   transformer. MATLAB/SIMULINK platform is used as a simulation tool to

   followed by the PM extract, daidzein and genistein for a period of
   30days with finasteride as positive control. The testosterone level was
   increased, indicating inhibition of 5-reductase converting testosterone

   level that significantly decreased when treated with PM extract,
   daidzein and genistein. The PM extract, daidzein and genistein reduced
   the increase in the prostate/body weight ratio in testosterone-induced
   rats. This gives indication that PM extract, daidzein and genistein
   possessed protective activity for the treatment of benign prostatic

Abstract = {{Clinicians regularly assess, diagnose and manage illnesses which are
   directly or indirectly linked to environmental exposures. Yet, various
   studies have identified gaps in environmental assessment in routine
   clinical practice. This review assessed clinicians' environmental health
   practices, attitudes and beliefs, and competencies and training.
   Relevant articles were sought using a systematic search strategy using
   five databases, grey literature and a hand search. Search strategies and
   protocols were developed using tailored mesh terms and keywords. 43 out
   of 11,291 articles were eligible for inclusion. Clinicians' attitudes
   and beliefs towards environmental health and routine clinical practice
   were generally positive, with most clinicians believing that
   environmental hazards affect human health. However, with the exception
   of tobacco smoke exposure, environmental health assessment was
   infrequently part of routine clinical practice. Clinicians'
   self-competence in environmental assessment was reported to be
   inadequate. Major challenges were the time required to complete an
   assessment, inadequate training and concerns about negative patients'
   responses. Clinicians have strong positive attitudes and beliefs about
   the importance of environmental health assessments. However, more
   concerted and robust strategies will be needed to support clinicians in
   assuming their assessment and counselling roles related to a wider range
   of environmental hazards.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) the
   mislocalization of epigenetic molecules between the cell nucleus and the
   cytoplasm. We have extended our finding to include the aberrant
   localization of histone 3 trimethylation on lysine 4 (H3k4me3), an
   epigenetic mark associated with actively transcribing genes as well as
   those poised for transcription. These findings raise the question of
   where the ectopic localization of H3k4me3 fits within the cascade of
   cell biological events in the progression of AD. We, therefore, examined
   the expression and intracellular location of H3k4me3 as a function of
   Braak stage and also in relation to a series of tau markers that are
   indicative of disease state. Both lines of evidence showed that ectopic
   localization of H3k4me3 is early in the course of disease. Because of
   the known role of H3k4me3 in the expression of synaptic genes, our data
   suggest an epigenetic role in synaptic deficits early in the course of
   AD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of aqueous solutions (deionized water or Na2CO3 solutions,
   0.1-0.5 M) and other processing parameters such as temperature (150-250
   degrees C) for preparing hydrothermal hot-pressed TV panel waste glass
   compacts was investigated to produce porous glass specimens. Waste
   powdered glass (5 g) from old analog Philips television panels (Mexico)
   with particle sizes of <38 mu m was mixed with various amounts of the
   selected aqueous solution (5-20 wt\%). The TV glass panel particles
   dissolved in all of the mineralizer solution that were employed, and the
   behavior was controlled by the amount of aqueous solution added to the
   glass powder densification stage. The reactions of the glass particles
   with water or Na2CO3 solutions produced a solid glass phase that
   included water molecules or Na+ and CO3-2 ions, respectively. The
   hydrothermal hot press (HHP)-treated glass compacts prepared at 200
   degrees C for 2 h at a constant loading pressure of 20 MPa exhibited a
   marked expansion after heat treatment conducted at 700 degrees C for 1 h
   in an air atmosphere. The expansion of the HHP compacted TV panel glass
   specimens was further increased for the samples prepared with 0.5 M
   Na2CO3 solution; these foamed glasses exhibited the lowest apparent
   densities that varied from 0.309 to 0.319 g/cm(3). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {{Postmortem lactate accumulation in skeletal muscle is linearly
   associated with the extent of pH decline. Yet, pigs harboring the AMPK
   gamma 3(R200Q) mutation produce meat with similar lactate levels to that
   of wild-type pigs but have a lower ultimate pH. We hypothesized that
   lower initial lactate levels and (or) lower buffering capacity in muscle
   of these pigs may help explain this discrepancy. Longissimus lumborum
   muscle samples were harvested at 0 and 1440 min postmortem from AMPK
   gamma 3(R200Q) and wild-type pigs. As expected, AMPK gamma 3(R200Q)
   muscle exhibited a lower ultimate pH but similar lactate levels to that
   of wild-type pigs at 1440 min postmortem. However, the total net lactate
   produced postmortem was greater in the AMPK gamma 3(R200Q) muscle due to
   lower initial lactate levels at 0 min postmortem. Buffering capacity
   measured over the pH range of 5.5-7.0 was also lower in AMPK gamma
   3(R200Q) muscle. Greater net lactate accumulation postmortem (i.e.,
   glycolytic flux) coupled with a lower buffering capacity explains the
   lower ultimate pH of meat from AMPK gamma 3(R200Q) pigs. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Fatty acids (FAs) are massively released from peripancreatic fat during
   acute pancreatitis (AP) and they were shown, as a whole, to induce
   inflammatory response in pancreatic acini. We investigated the
   mechanisms triggered by the major saturated FM (SFAs) and unsaturated FM
   (UFAs) in modulating the expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2
   (CCL2) in acinar cells. Pancreatic acini of control rats were treated
   with palmitic acid (PA) or stearic acid (SA), as SFAs, or oleic acid
   (OA) or linoleic acid (LA), as UFAs. By using specific inhibitors, the
   involvement of MAPKs (JNK, ERK, p38), JAK, NF-kappa B and STAT3 pathways
   was assessed. The role of PPAR gamma pathway was studied by using
   15-Deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ2). CCL2 mRNA was
   analyzed by qRT-PCR. By western blot, phosphorylated forms of MAPKs and
   JAK as well as I kappa B-alpha were analyzed in cytoplasm and
   p65-NF-kappa B and phospho-STAT3 in nucleus. No effect was found in PA-
   or SA-treated acini. Conversely, in response to OA or LA, MAPKs and JAK
   acted as upstream signals, driving the CCL2 up-regulation
   transcriptionally mediated by the synergic action of NF-kappa B and
   STAT3. By blocking the activation of NF-kappa B and STAT3, 15d-PGJ2
   totally inhibited the OA- and LA-induced CCL2 overexpression. We
   conclude that the most common UFAs, but not the SFAs, represented in
   peripancreatic fat and released during AP, are capable of up-regulating
   the acinar expression of CCL2, which depends on the activation of
   MAPK/JAK-mediated NF-kappa B and STAT3 pathways. By targeting both
   transcription factors, PPAR gamma agonists could be indicated as
   potential therapy in AP. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An attempt was made to: (1) estimate the use and overuse of medically
   indicated and elective Cesarean sections (CS) in countries with reported
   lower and higher rates of CS; (2) understand the resource-use
   implications of indicated and elective CS in countries with lower and
   higher rates of CS. CS rates published in the literature, as well as in
   the WHO database were considered to provide country-level estimates of
   CS rates. Unit costs for the inputs identifiedwere derived from a search
   of literature and databases, as well as from consultation with costing
   experts. Findings indicate on an unequal global distribution of CS.
   Medically not indicated and elective CS posses legal-medical, as well as
   unequivocal economical pitfalls, and appear to command a
   disproportionate share of global economic resources. Excessive CS could
   have important negative implications for health equity within and across
   countries. If all resources used on elective CS could be allocated to
   countries with undeserved population, the medically indicated procedures
   could be fully financed, and there would be a surplus of resources with
   a value of nearly US/\$2 billion. Finally, studies have attempted to
   model the impact of tort reform on primary and repeat CS rates and have
   shown that modest improvements in the medical-legal climatemay result in
   reductions in CS. It is concluded that both caps on noneconomic damages
   and reductions in physician malpractice premiums would result in fewer
   CS.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism underlying the lateral interactions (LI) phenomenon is
   still an enigma. Over the years, several groups have tried to explain
   the phenomenon and suggested models to predict its psychophysical
   results. Most of these models comprise both inhibitory and facilitatory
   mechanisms for describing the LI phenomenon. Their studies' assumption
   that a significant inhibition mechanism exists is based on the classical
   interpretation of the threshold elevation perceived in psychophysical
   experiments. In this work, we suggest a different interpretation of the
   threshold elevation obtained experimentally. Our model proposes and
   demonstrates how a facilitatory additive mechanism can solely predict
   both the facilitation and ``inhibition{''} aspects of the phenomenon,
   without the need for an additional inhibitory mechanism, at least for
   the two flankers' configurations. Though the model is simple it succeeds
   to predict the LI effect under a large variety of stimuli configurations
   and parameters. The model is in agreement with both classical and recent
   psychophysical and neurophysiological results. We suggest that the LI
   mechanism plays a role in creating an educated guess to form a
   continuation of gratings and textures based on the surrounding visual
   stimuli. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Current federal case law allows warrantless observation of property from
   manned aerial vehicles if they are in publicly navigable airspace. The
   increasing domestic use of unmanned aerial vehicles, colloquially known
   as ``drones,{''} and the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) efforts
   to develop regulations to integrate them into national airspace
   implicate sensitive constitutional privacy issues. In response, several
   states are enacting or have already enacted statutes to regulate drone
   use. This Note discusses how state drone statutes may inform the Supreme
   Court's interpretation of the Fourth Amendment and its protection
   against unreasonable searches by drones - specifically, whether state
   drone statutes may influence the Court's current understanding of the
   ``reasonable expectation of privacy{''} when it is inevitably applied in
   warrantless drone surveillance cases.
   First, this Note reviews Fourth Amendment jurisprudence regarding
   surveillance technologies and searches. It then provides a survey of
   state drone statutes currently in effect, their purposes, and their
   practical effects on the use of drones by the government and private
   parties. Next, this Note discusses how state drone statutes may interact
   with Fourth Amendment jurisprudence and inform the Supreme Court's
   understanding of reasonable expectations of privacy in the context of
   drones. As drone technology develops, state statutes can influence and
   reflect social norms and expectations regarding drone use and the type
   of information discoverable by drones, while creating a source of
   protection for privacy interests that is independent of the Fourth
   Amendment. Furthermore, policy arguments made during the development of
   state drone statutes may legitimate people's expectations of privacy
   against drones. Ultimately, this Note predicts that state drone statutes
   will likely influence the Court's jurisprudence on the reasonable
   expectation of privacy, whether explicitly or implicitly, as drones
   develop technologically and are regulated.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Adenosine A(2A) receptors (A(2A)R) modulate dopamine and
   glutamate signaling and thereby may influence some of the psychomotor
   and cognitive processes associated with schizophrenia. Because
   astroglial A(2A)R regulate the availability of glutamate, we
   hypothesized that they might play an unprecedented role in some of the
   processes leading to the development of schizophrenia, which we
   investigated using a mouse line with a selective deletion of A(2A)R in
   astrocytes (Gfa2-A(2A)R knockout {[}KO] mice].
   METHODS: We examined Gfa2-A(2A)R KO mice for behaviors thought to
   recapitulate some features of schizophrenia, namely enhanced MK-801
   psychomotor response (positive symptoms) and decreased working memory
   (cognitive symptoms). In addition, we probed for neurochemical
   alterations in the glutamatergic circuitry, evaluating glutamate uptake
   and release and the levels of key proteins defining glutamatergic
   signaling (glutamate transporter-I {[}GLT-I], N-methyl-D-aspartate
   receptors {[}NMDA-R] and alpha-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
   acid receptors {[}AMPA-R]) to provide a mechanistic understanding of the
   phenotype encountered.
   RESULTS: We show that Gfa2-A(2A)R KO mice exhibited enhanced MK-801
   psychomotor response and decreased working memory; this was accompanied
   by a disruption of glutamate homeostasis characterized by aberrant GLT-I
   activity, increased presynaptic glutamate release, NMDA-R 2B subunit
   upregulation, and increased internalization of AMPA-R. Accordingly,
   selective GLT-I inhibition or blockade of GluR1/2 endocytosis prevented
   the psychomotor and cognitive phenotypes in Gfa2-A(2A)R KO mice, namely
   in the nucleus accumbens.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the dysfunction of astrocytic
   A(2A)R, by controlling GLT-I activity, triggers an astrocyte-to-neuron
   wave of communication resulting in disrupted glutamate homeostasis,
   thought to underlie several endophenotypes relevant to schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in digital microfluidics (DMF), where discrete droplets are
   manipulated in a miniaturized device, has grown rapidly due to the
   versatility that arises from non-linear control of fluids. Adding
   superparamagnetic particles to the fluid allows the droplet to be
   manipulated by magnetic fields, such as that from a simple permanent
   magnet, removing some of the complexity of previous DMF devices and
   adding enhanced robustness. The magnetic field strength need not be high
   to control commercially available magnetic silica microparticles,
   however a hydrophobic surface is required to provide reduced friction.
   In this study, three types of hydrophobic surfaces were explored for
   their use in the magnetic actuationof water droplets containing magnetic
   particles. A conventional fluoropolymer film was found to have excessive
   frictional resistance to effectively actuate droplets. A natural
   superhydrophobic surface, the Colocasia leaf, was found to have too much
   surface microstructure to allow the magnetic particles to move freely
   over the surface. The commercially available Ultra-Ever Dry (R), on the
   other hand, was suitable for effective magnetic actuation of aqueous and
   mixed droplets as it provided a robust, virtually frictionless surface.
   Based on fluorinated silica nanoparticles, this surface allowed a 20 mu
   L water droplet to be manually pulled by a magnet at speeds in excess of
   550 mm s(-1). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the impact of increasing global demand for high-grade steel for a
   variety of applications at a time when high grade iron ore reserves are
   becoming depleted, the removal of impurities, and especially phosphorus,
   has become essential. Demand in the rapidly growing car industry, in
   particular, is increasing pressure on steelmakers to provide high
   quality steel. The dephosphorization step presents new opportunities to
   steelmakers: besides producing high-quality steels not prone to cracking
   or corrosion, and improving production efficiency, steelmakers are
   presented with the opportunity to recover phosphorus and market it as a
   value-added product. Another industry with potential to recover P as a
   secondary product is the surface treatment industry. Surface treatment
   and the galvanization of metal products requires phosphoric acid and
   generates waste containing phosphorus, which is typically not well
   recovered or recycled. In this study, we focus on the potential of
   steelmaking slag and waste sludge from nickel plating and metal surface
   treatment processes as non-traditional phosphorus resources. An MFA on
   the hidden phosphorus flow behind global iron ore trade showed that,
   that the hidden flow of phosphorus from the three major iron ore export
   countries to China alone was 331 kt in 2013, which is equivalent to
   1.7\% of the global consumption of P in fertilizers consumed that year.
   In 2013, 3.6 kilo ton of phosphorus was wasted in acid waste from the
   metal surface treatment industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Aim: The factors associated with the outcome of sequential therapy with
   interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) in order to halt nucleoside/nucleotide
   analog (NUC) maintenance treatment for chronic hepatitis B were
   analyzed.
   Methods: A total of 50 patients with chronic hepatitis B who underwent
   IFN-alpha sequential therapy for cessation of NUC were enrolled
   retrospectively. The subjects received NUC plus IFN-alpha for 4 weeks
   followed by IFN-alpha alone for 20 weeks. Natural IFN-alpha of 6-MU
   doses was administrated three times a week. A successful response to
   NUC/IFN-alpha sequential therapy was defined as serum hepatitis B virus
   (HBV) DNA below 4.0 log copies/mL, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
   below 30 IU/L, and hepatitis B e-antigen negativity at 24 months after
   completing the treatment.
   Results: Multivariate analysis revealed that hepatitis B surface antigen
   (HBsAg) of 3.0 log U/mL or more (P < 0.002) and hepatitis B core-related
   antigen (hepatitis B core-related antigen {[}HBcrAg]) of 4.5 log U/mL or
   more (P < 0.003) at the start of IFN-alpha administration were
   significant factors associated with a 24-month non-response. Maximal
   levels of ALT and HBV DNA during the follow-up period after completing
   IFN-alpha therapy were significantly related (P < 0.001), and receiver
   operating characteristic analysis showed that both maximal ALT (P <
   0.001) and HBV DNA(P < 0.001) were significantly related to the final
   24-month response.
   Conclusion: The combinational use of HBsAg and HBcrAg levels may be
   useful to predict the 24-month outcome of NUC/IFN-alpha sequential
   therapy. Maximal levels of ALT and HBV DNA during post-treatment
   follow-up may also help monitor responses to IFN-alpha sequential
   therapy.}},

   due to a diagnosis of a mediastinal hemorrhage from the tumorous lesion,
   accompanied by a decrease in the Hb value. The pathological findings of

Abstract = {{In the previous article (Matsutani et al., 2012) we numerically
   investigated an electric potential problem with high contrast local
   conductivities (gamma(0) and gamma(1), 0 < gamma(0) << gamma(1)) for a
   two-dimensional continuum percolation model (CPM). As numerical results,
   we showed there that the equipotential curves exhibit the fractal
   structure around the threshold p(c) and gave an approximated curve
   representing a relation between the homogenized conductivity and the
   volume fraction p over {[}p(c), 1]. In this article, using the duality
   of the conductivities and the quasi-harmonic properties, we
   re-investigate these topics to improve these results. We show that at
   gamma(0) -> 0, the quasi-harmonic potential problem in CPM is
   quasiconformally equivalent to a random slit problem, which leads us to
   an observation between the conformal property and the fractal structure
   at the threshold. Further we extend the domain {[}p(c), 1] of the
   approximated curve to {[}0,1] based on the these results, which is
   partially generalized to three dimensional case. These curves represent
   well the numerical results of the conductivities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{The dihydrofolate reductase gene amplification system is widely used in
   Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells for the industrial production of
   therapeutic proteins. To enhance the efficiency of conventional gene
   amplification systems, we previously presented a novel method using
   cell-cycle checkpoint engineering. Here, we constructed high-producing
   and stable cells by the conditional expression of mutant cell division
   cycle 25 homolog B (CDC25B) using the Cre-loxP system. A bispecific
   antibody-producing CHO DG44-derived cell line was transfected with foxed
   mutant CDC25B. After inducing gene amplification in the presence of 250
   nM methotrexate, mutant CDC25B sequence was removed by Cre recombinase
   protein expression. Overexpression of the foxed mutant CDC25B
   significantly enhanced the efficiency of transgene amplification and
   productivity. Moreover, the specific production rate of the isolated
   clone CHO Cre-1 and Cre-2 were approximately 11-fold and 15-fold higher
   than that of mock-transfected clone CHO Mock-S. Chromosomal aneuploidy
   was increased by mutant CDC25B overexpression, but Cre-1 and Cre-2 did
   not show any changes in chromosome number during long-term cultivation,
   as is the case with CHO Mock-S. Our results suggest that high-producing
   and stable cells can be constructed by conditionally controlling a
   cell-cycle checkpoint integrated in conventional gene amplification
   systems. (c) 2015, The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. All rights

Abstract = {{Background The treatment of patients with metastatic melanomas that
   harbour BRAF V600E or V600K mutations with trametinib plus dabrafenib
   appears to be superior to treatment with vemurafenib alone. This
   treatment regimen is likely to become available in Switzerland in the
   near future.
   Objectives To determine the cost-effectiveness of trametinib plus
   dabrafenib.
   Methods A Markov cohort simulation was conducted to model the clinical
   course of typical patients with metastatic melanoma. Information on
   response rates, clinical condition and follow-up treatments were derived
   and transition probabilities estimated based on the results of a
   clinical trial that compared treatment with trametinib plus dabrafenib
   vs. vemurafenib alone.
   Results Treatment with trametinib plus dabrafenib was estimated to cost
   an additional CHF199 647 (Swiss francs) on average and yield a gain of
   0.52 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), resulting in an incremental
   cost-effectiveness ratio of CHF385 603 per QALY. Probabilistic
   sensitivity analyses showed that a willingness-to-pay threshold of
   CHF100 000 per QALY would not be reached at the current US price of
   trametinib.
   Conclusions The introduction of trametinib in Switzerland at US market
   prices for the treatment of metastatic BRAF V600-mutated melanoma with
   trametinib plus dabrafenib is unlikely to be cost-effective compared
   with vemurafenib monotherapy. A reduction in the total price of the
   combination therapy is required to achieve an acceptable
   cost-effectiveness ratio for this clinically promising treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The utilization of natural resources from asteroids is an idea that is
   older than the Space Age. The technologies are now available to
   transform this endeavor from an idea into reality. The Asteroid Redirect
   Mission (ARM) is a mission concept which includes the goal of
   robotically returning a small Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) or a multi-ton
   boulder from a large NEA to cislunar space in the mid-2020s using an
   advanced Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) vehicle and currently available
   technologies. The paradigm shift enabled by the ARM concept would allow
   in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) to be used at the human mission
   departure location (i.e., cislunar space) versus exclusively at the
   deep-space mission destination. This approach drastically reduces the
   barriers associated with utilizing ISRU for human deep-space missions.
   The successful testing of ISRU techniques and associated equipment could
   enable large-scale commercial ISRU operations to become a reality and
   enable a future space-based economy utilizing processed asteroidal
   materials. This paper provides an overview of the ARM concept and
   discusses the mission objectives, key technologies, and capabilities
   associated with the mission, as well as how the ARM and associated
   operations would benefit humanity's quest for the exploration and
   settlement of space. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of

   direction and location of each propulsion jet. A design with angled jets
   combined with a body aspect ratio of 1.2-1.8 is controllable and
   exhibits good performance. A prototype robot with an optimized body

Abstract = {{Microplastics are present in marine habitats worldwide and may be
   ingested by low trophic organisms such as fish larvae, with uncertain
   physiological consequences. The present study aims at assessing the
   impact of polyethylene (PE 10-45 mu M) microbeads ingestion in European
   sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) larvae. Fish were fed an inert diet
   including 0, 10(4) and 10(5) fluorescent microbeads per gram from 7
   until 43 days post-hatching (dph). Microbeads were detected in the
   gastrointestinal tract in all fish fed diet incorporating PE. Our data
   revealed an efficient elimination of PE beads from the gut since no
   fluorescent was observed in the larvae after 48 h depuration. While the
   mortality rate increased significantly with the amount of microbeads
   scored per larvae at 14 and 20 dph, only ingestion of the highest
   concentration slightly impacted mortality rates. Larval growth and
   inflammatory response through Interleukine-1-beta (IL-1 beta) gene
   expression were not found to be affected while cytochrome-P450-1A1
   (cyp1a1) expression level was significantly positively correlated with
   the number of microbeads scored per larva at 20 dph. Overall, these
   results suggest that ingestion of PE microbeads had limited impact on
   sea bass larvae possibly due to their high potential of egestion. (C)

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Thrombomodulin (TM) is a multidomain, transmembrane protein
   with anti-inflammatory properties. Thrombomodulin domain (D) 1 is
   lectin-like, interacting with Lewis Y antigen on lipopolysaccharide, and
   with HMGB1, while TMD23 is associated with angiogenic and
   anti-inflammatory functions. Thus, we tested if TM is protective against
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis and whether it enhanced corneal
   vascularity.
   METHODS. Eyes of C57BL/6 (B6) mice were injected with recombinant TM
   (rTM), rTMD1, or PBS subconjunctivally before and intraperitoneally
   after infection with P. aeruginosa. Clinical scores, photography with a
   slit lamp, RT-PCR, ELISA, myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay, viable bacterial
   plate counts, and India ink perfusion were used to assess the disease
   response and corneal vascularity (rTM only).
   RESULTS. Recombinant TM versus PBS treatment reduced clinical scores and
   corneal opacity. Corneal mRNA levels for HMGB1 were unchanged, but
   proinflammatory molecules IL-1 beta, CXCL2, NF-kappa B, TLR4, and RAGE
   were decreased; anti-inflammatory molecules SIGIRR and ST2 were
   increased. ELISA confirmed the mRNA data for HMGB1, IL-1b, and CXCL2
   proteins. Both neutrophil influx and viable bacterial plate counts also
   were decreased after rTM treatment. Protein levels for angiogenic
   molecules VEGF, VEGFR-1, and VEGFR-2 were measured at 5 days post
   infection and were not different or reduced significantly after rTM
   treatment. Further, perfusion with India ink revealed similar vessel
   ingrowth between the two groups. Similar studies were performed with
   rTMD1, but disease severity, mRNA, proteins, MPO, and plate counts were
   not changed from controls.
   CONCLUSIONS. These data provide evidence that rTM treatment is
   protective against bacterial keratitis, does not reduce HMGB1, and is
   not angiogenic.}},

   Results A total of 113 papers were eligible, of which 65 were in BMJ, 17
   in The Lancet and 31 in JAMA. Although a generally high level of
   reporting was found, eligibility criteria were often problematic. In
   67\% of papers, eligibility was specified after the search sources or
   terms. Unjustified time restrictions were used in 21\% of reviews, and
   unpublished or unspecified data in 27\%. Inconsistency between journals
   was apparent in the requirements for systematic reviews.
   Conclusions The quality of reviews in these leading medical journals was
   high; however, there were issues that reduce the clarity and
   replicability of the review process. As well as providing a useful
   checklist, this methodological review informs the continued development
   of standards for systematic reviews.}},

Abstract = {{Junonia lemonias (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Nymphalinae), the lemon
   pansy, is a nymphalid butterfly found throughout South and Southeast
   Asia. Its wings display seasonal polyphenism in the size and
   distinctiveness of their wing color patterns, varying considerably
   between wet and dry seasons. In both seasonal forms, two prominent
   eyespots are found on both the forewings and hindwings. The common name
   for this butterfly comes from the bright lemon-yellow coloring found
   around the eyespots and wing margins. The complete mitochondria! genome
   off. lemonias is 15,230 bp long. There are 37 genes, 13 of which are
   protein coding. The mitogenome shares many features and is similar in
   length to other published Junonia mitochondrial genomes. There are 22
   tRNAs present in the mitochondrial genome, along with two rRNAs and a
   control region consisting of 333 bp. The mitochondrial genome is AT-rich
   with 80.40\% AT nucleotides. The majority coding sequence strand has a
   nucleotide skew toward T and C bases. Fifteen intergenic spacers are
   present, along with 11 regions of sequence overlap. Many conserved
   features of the mitogenome found across Nymphalidae are also present in
   J. lemonias. Widespread mitochondrial genome synteny occurs in this
   family, allowing entire mitogenomes to be aligned for phylogenetic
   analysis. Parsimony and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of both
   the entire mitochondrial genome and first and second codons of
   mitochondrial protein-coding genes suggest that Junonia and the
   Nymphalinae are monophyletic and that the Nymphalinae may be the sister
   group to a Glade containing the nymphalid subfamilies Apaturinae,
   Biblidinae, and Cyrestinae. (C) 2015 Korean Society of Applied

Abstract = {{Recent research has identified youth who utilize both aggressive and
   prosocial behavior with peers. Although the social values and
   motivations associated with aggression and prosocial behavior have been
   well studied, the values of youth who utilize both aggression and
   prosocial behavior are unknown. The current study identified groups of
   adolescents based on peer nominations of aggression and prosocial
   behavior from both Israel (n = 569; 56.94 \% Arab, 43.06 \% Jewish;
   53.78 \% female) and the United States (n = 342; 67.54 \%
   African-American; 32.46 \% European-American; 50.88 \% female).
   Self-enhancement, self-transcendence, openness-to-change, and
   conservation values predicted behavioral group membership. Power values
   predicted membership in the aggressive group relative to the
   aggressive-prosocial, prosocial, and low-both groups. For Israeli boys,
   openness-to-change values predicted membership in the
   aggressive-prosocial group relative to the prosocial group. The values
   of aggressive-prosocial youth were more similar to the values of
   prosocial peers than to aggressive peers, suggesting that motivational
   interventions for aggressive-prosocial youth should differ in important
   ways than those for aggressive youth.}},

Title = {{Quality analysis of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion in the
   outpatient versus inpatient setting: analysis of 7288 patients from the
   NSQIP database}},
Journal = {{NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{OBJECT In an era of escalating health care cost and universal pressure
   of improving efficiency and cost of care, ambulatory surgery centers
   (ASCs) have emerged as lower cost options for many surgical therapies.
   Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is one of the most
   prevalent spine surgeries performed and is rapidly increasing with an
   expanding aging population. While ASCs offer cost advantages for ACDF,
   there is a scarcity of evidence that ASCs allow for equivalent quality
   and thus superior health care value. Therefore, the authors analyzed a
   nationwide, prospective quality improvement registry (National Surgical
   Quality Improvement Program {[}NSQIP]) to compare the quality of ACDF
   surgery performed in the outpatient ASC versus the inpatient hospital
   setting.
   METHODS Patients undergoing ACDF (2005-2011) were identified from the
   NSQIP database based on the primary Current Procedural Terminology
   codes. Patients were divided into 2 cohorts (outpatient vs inpatient)
   based on the acute care setting documented in the NSQIP database. All
   30-day surgical morbidity and mortality rates were compared between the
   2 groups. Propensity score matching and multivariate logistic regression
   analysis were used to adjust for confounding factors and to identify the
   independent association of outpatient ACDF with perioperative outcomes
   and morbidity.
   RESULTS A total of 7288 ACDF cases were identified (inpatient = 6120,
   outpatient = 1168). Unadjusted rates of major morbidity (0.94\% vs
   4.5\%, p < 0.001) and return to the operating room (OR) within 30 days
   (0.3\% vs 2.0\%, p < 0.001) were significantly lower in outpatient
   versus inpatient ACDF. After propensity matching 1442 cases (inpatient =
   650, outpatient = 792) based on baseline 32 covariates, rates of major
   morbidity (1.4\% vs 3.1\%, p = 0.03), and return to the OR (0.34\% vs
   1.4\%, p = 0.04) remained significantly lower after outpatient ACDF.
   Adjusted comparison using multivariate logistic regression demonstrated
   that ACDF performed in the outpatient setting had 58\% lower odds of
   having a major morbidity and 80\% lower odds of return to the OR within
   30 days.
   CONCLUSIONS An analysis of a nationwide, prospective quality improvement
   registry representing more than 250 hospitals demonstrates that 1- to
   2-level ACDF can be safely performed in the outpatient ambulatory
   surgery setting in patients who are appropriate candidates. In an effort
   to decrease cost of care, surgeons can safely consider performing ACDF
   in an ASC environment.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribing tasks, which involve pharmacological knowledge, clinical
   decision-making and practical skill, take place within unpredictable
   social environments and involve interactions within and between
   endlessly changing health care teams. Despite this, curriculum designers
   commonly assume them to be simple to learn and perform. This research
   used mixed methods to explore how undergraduate medical students learn
   to prescribe in the `real world'. It was informed by cognitive
   psychology, sociocultural theory, and systems thinking. We found that
   learning to prescribe occurs as a dynamic series of socially negotiated
   interactions within and between individuals, communities and
   environments. As well as a thematic analysis, we developed a framework
   of three conceptual spaces in which learning opportunities for
   prescribing occur. This illustrates a complex systems view of
   prescribing education and defines three major system components: the
   ``social space{''}, where the environmental conditions influence or
   bring about a learning experience; the ``process space{''}, describing
   what happens during the learning experience; and the intra-personal
   ``cognitive space{''}, where the learner may develop aspects of
   prescribing expertise. This conceptualisation broadens the scope of
   inquiry of prescribing education research by highlighting the complex
   interplay between individual and social dimensions of learning. This
   perspective is also likely to be relevant to students' learning of other
   clinical competencies.}},

Abstract = {{Among the myriad witchcraft narratives which operate in rural Malawi is
   the understanding of the supernatural as empowering the nation's elite
   and its international donors. This narrative clashes with academic and
   other literature that ignores contextual understandings of the
   supernatural and reduces witchcraft accusations to a resistance to
   development, and leads to the belief (on the part of some academics and
   many development practitioners) that the solution to witchcraft
   accusations lies in more development. Conversely, however, this
   particular Malawian intersection of development and
   witchcraft/supernatural narratives creates a situation where further
   development can inadvertently entrench both rural Malawians' renderings
   of the supernatural and their disempowerment vis-a-vis donors and
   technocrats. To support this claim, the article builds upon works
   detailing the intimate relationship between witchcraft and development
   and foregrounds the Malawi case to show how those invested in
   development may reinforce witchcraft beliefs.}},

Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{57-66}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the effect of weave architecture on the ballistic impact
   response of woven fabric metal matrix composites (MMC) is investigated.
   The ballistic limits, V-50(BL) of four different composites are
   experimentally determined and post impact characterization is used to
   investigate the damage mechanisms active during dynamic loading.
   Numerical modeling implementing an elastic plastic orthotropic material
   model with hydrostatic pressure dependent yield surface is used to model
   the pressure dependent response of the MMC during impact to predict the
   ballistic limit, and to offer insight into the damage mechanisms
   occurring during dynamic loading of woven fabric reinforced MMC. The
   correlation between laterally constrained compression testing and
   ballistic performance is investigated for use as a screening tool to
   enable rapid evaluation of the relative ballistic performance of
   potential fabric MMC weave and composite designs as a potential
   alternative to full scale ballistic testing. It was found that the
   fabric architecture has significant effect on ballistic performance and
   through thickness shear strength of the MMCs. It was found that 3D woven
   MMC is 13\% and 40\% lower in terms of ballistic limit and through
   thickness shear strength respectively, than its 2D counterpart.
   Furthermore, the numerical results successfully predict the ballistic
   limit of a 2D fabric reinforced MMC within 6\% of the experiment and are
   used to qualitatively elucidate the experimentally observed damage
   mechanisms. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This Essay takes seriously the relevance of law enforcement
   effectiveness and the role of empiricism in understanding the
   constitutionality of the police practices at issue in the Floyd case and
   urban police practices more generally; it also recasts the debate a bit.
   A critical but obscured issue is the mismatch between the level of
   analysis at which the Supreme Court articulated the relevant test for
   constitutional justification of a stop-and-frisk in Terry v Ohio and the
   scale at which police today (and historically) engage in stop-and-frisk
   as a practice. To put this more succinctly, while the Court in Terry
   authorized police intervention in an individual incident-when the police
   officer possesses probable cause to believe that an armed individual is
   involved in a crime-in reality, stop-and-frisk typically is carried out
   by a police force en masse as a program. Although the constitutional
   framework is based on a one-off investigative incident, many of those
   who are stopped-the majority of them young men of color-do not
   experience the stops as one-off incidents. They experience them as a
   program to police them as a group, which is, of course, the reality.
   That is exactly what police agencies are doing. Fourth Amendment
   reasonableness must take this fact into account. I make an argument here
   about how we should approach this issue.}},

Abstract = {{Why do workers participate in their own exploitation? This article moves
   beyond the situational production of consent that has dominated studies
   of the labor process and outlines the relational production of labor's
   surplus value. Using a case of unpaid women who perform valuable work
   for VIP nightclubs, I present ethnographic data on the VIP party circuit
   from New York, the Hamptons, Miami, and Cannes, as well as 84 interviews
   with party organizers and guests. Party promoters, mostly male brokers,
   appropriate surplus value from women in four stages: recruitment,
   mobilization, performance, and control. Relational work between
   promoters and women, cemented by gifts and strategic intimacies, frames
   women's labor as leisure and friendship, and boundary work legitimizes
   women's work as distinct from sexual labor. When boundaries, media, and
   meanings of relationships do not appropriately align, as in relational
   mismatches, women experience the VIP party less as leisure and more as
   work, and they are less likely to participate. My findings embed the
   labor process in a relational infrastructure and hold insights for
   explaining why people work for free in culture and technology sectors of
   the post-Fordist economy.}},

Abstract = {{Litter decomposition in the streams of the Brazilian Cerrado (Savannah)
   is generally slow. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that leaf
   litter decomposition is limited by low dissolved nutrient availability.
   We measured the decomposition of the litter of the riparian species
   Protium heptaphyllum in a local stream under nutrient enrichment
   promoted by nutrient-diffusing substrates (nutrient-enriched treatment;
   N and P), and under control conditions (no added nutrients). Leaves were
   enclosed in fine (0.5 mm) mesh bags and immersed in the stream.
   Replicate samples were retrieved periodically over 56 days. At the end
   of the experiment, leaf mass loss, associated microbial biomass (ATP and
   ergosterol) and fungal sporulation rates were significantly higher in
   nutrient-enriched bags than in control bags. These results suggest that
   litter decomposition in certain Cerrado streams is partially limited by
   the low availability of dissolved nutrients.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To estimate the 5-year incidence and progression of diabetic
   retinopathy (DR) among persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).
   Design: Population-based, prospective, cohort study.
   Participants: The RETINODIAB (Study Group for Diabetic Retinopathy
   Screening) program was implemented in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley area
   between July 2009 and December 2014. A total of 109 543 readable
   screening examinations were performed and corresponded to 56 903
   patients who attended the screening program at entry. A total of 30 641
   patients (53.85\%) had at least 1 further screening event within the
   study period and were included in the analysis.
   Methods: Participants underwent two 45 degrees nonstereoscopic retinal
   digital photographs per eye according to RETINODIAB protocol. All images
   were graded according to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy
   Scale. Referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR) was defined for all patients
   graded as moderate nonproliferative DR (NPDR), severe NPDR, or
   proliferative DR (PDR), with or without maculopathy or mild NPDR with
   maculopathy. Nonparametric estimates of the annual and cumulative
   incidences were obtained by Turnbull's estimator. Associations between
   the potential risk factors and the time to onset/progression of
   retinopathy were assessed through a parametric survival analysis for
   interval-censored data.
   Main Outcome Measures: The authors estimated the onset and progression
   incidence rates of DR.
   Results: Yearly incidence of any DR in patients without retinopathy at
   baseline was 4.60\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 3.96-4.76) in the
   first year, decreasing to 3.87\% (95\% CI, 2.57-5.78) in the fifth year.
   In participants with mild NPDR at baseline, the progression rate to RDR
   in year 1 was 1.18\% (95\% CI, 0.96-1.33). Incidence of any DR and RDR
   and DR progression rate were associated with known duration of diabetes,
   age at diagnosis, and use of insulin treatment.
   Conclusions: This longitudinal epidemiologic study provides the first
   Portuguese incidence DR data in a large-scale population-based cohort of
   type 2 diabetes after a 5-year follow-up. Duration of diabetes, age at
   diagnosis, and insulin treatment were associated with increasing risk of
   incidence and progression of DR. A personalized schedule distribution of
   screening intervals according to the individual patient's profile should
   be implemented, with resulting benefits in terms of health costs. (C)

Abstract = {{External scrutiny of higher education courses is evident globally, but
   the use of an external examiner from another institution for the

   identification of a number of largely unchallenged assumptions

   assessment literate. This study evaluates levels of assessment literacy
   demonstrated within the written reports of external examiners. Findings

Abstract = {{Research problem: Our study focuses on how students collaborate online
   to produce specific written genres, using particular collaborative
   technologies to work together productively, and how instructor feedback
   and student perspectives on collaborative work influence those
   activities in online classrooms. Research questions: When composing
   using collaborative web-based writing applications, do students focus
   primarily on the interface or the text space? What kinds of expectations
   about collaborative writing do students bring to the interface and text
   space? To what extent can we characterize students' acknowledgement of a
   third space, what we have identified as ``communicative interaction?{''}
   Literature review: Workplace collaboration is important because
   organizations increasingly demand effective collaborators, team members,
   and team leaders, and technologies for sharing, cobuilding, and feedback
   are readily available to support these activities. Student preparation
   for workplace collaboration is important because students struggle when
   they are asked to write together, particularly when the collaborative
   process involves new technologies, and yet knowledge of collaborative
   writing strategies and experience with collaborative technologies, such
   as Google Docs, are the very competencies that organizations expect of
   them. Methodology: Thirteen groups of 3 to 4 technical writing students
   and science communication students enrolled in online professional
   writing courses at a major research university wrote feature
   specifications and reports on the globalization of the sciences,
   respectively, using Google Docs within Google Drive. Sixteen of 37
   students responded to a set of questions asking them to reflect on their
   experiences working collaboratively, learning new genres, using the
   collaborative environment, and revising with instructor feedback.
   Results and conclusions: We found that students struggled most with
   adapting their already established collaborative strategies grounded in
   face-to-face learning situations to an online learning environment,
   where they felt their means of communication and expression were
   limited. The results suggest that effective collaborative experiences,
   properly executed, represent a repertoire of competencies that go well
   beyond only technical considerations, such as being able to effectively

Abstract = {{A hybrid Artificial Potential Field (APF) method is addressed in this
   paper for Autonomous Surface Vessel (ASV) cruising in the dynamic
   riverine environment. Firstly, a balance control scheme is proposed to
   replace the attractive potential function and perform the ASV tracking
   along the centerline of the river. Then, to simplify the repulsive
   potential function, the relative velocity between ASV and obstacle is
   derived from relative position, which reduces the requirement of
   on-board sensing. Finally, two challenging scenarios, head-on situation
   and overtaking situation, where ASV encounters another moving ship in a
   river are simulated. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed
   hybrid APF method is effective for simultaneous path planning and
   obstacle avoidance in the dynamic riverine environment.}},

Abstract = {{Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is the
   most widely used parasitoid in biological control of Tephritidae
   programs around the world. Nevertheless, we have little information
   about the use of these parasitoids against Anastrepha fraterculus
   (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae). This study was conducted to evaluate
   the thermal requirements for the development of D. longicaudata in 2 of
   its hosts, A. fraterculus and Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera:
   Tephritidae). Third instars of each fly species were exposed for 1 h to
   50 couples of the parasitoid. Subsequently, the larvae were placed
   individually in glass jars maintained in chambers at temperatures of 15,
   18, 21, 25, 28, and 31 degrees C, at 60 +/- 10\% RH and a photoperiod of
   14:10 h L:D until the emergence of D. longicaudata. The rate of
   development of D. longicaudata, in both hosts, increased as temperature
   increased. The development period of egg-to-adult phases was used to
   estimate, by the hyperbola method, the lower development threshold (Dt)
   and the thermal constant (K) of D. longicaudata. Dt and K were,
   respectively, 7.83 degrees C and 322.58 degree days for individuals that
   developed in C. capitata, and 12.5 degrees C and 227.27 degree days for
   those that developed in A. fraterculus. Adult longevity was inversely
   proportional to temperature. The results indicated that D. longicaudata
   may not develop in Rio Grande do Sul in the winter, because it is very
   common that minimum temperatures in the months of Jun and Jul fall below
   the Dt. In the 4 fruit-producing regions of the state of Rio Grande do
   Sul, the average numbers of generations of D. longicaudata per year were
   estimated in A. fraterculus and C. capitata, respectively, as follows:
   Porto Alegre (11.16 and 13.12), Pelotas (7.97 and 10.89), Bento
   Goncalves (6.99 and 10.05), and Vacaria (4.84 and 8.28).}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The current study applied egocentric social network
   analysis (SNA) to investigate the prevalence of addictive behavior and
   co-occurring substance use in college students' networks. Specifically,
   we examined individuals' perceptions of the frequency of network
   members' co-occurring addictive behavior and investigated whether
   co-occurring addictive behavior is spread evenly throughout networks or
   is more localized in clusters. We also examined differences in network
   composition between individuals with varying levels of alcohol use.
   Method: The study utilized an egocentric SNA approach in which
   respondents ({''}egos{''}) enumerated 30 of their closest friends,
   family members, co-workers, and significant others ({''}alters{''}) and
   the relations among alters listed. Participants were 281 undergraduates
   at a large university in the Southeastern United States.
   Results: Robust associations were observed among the frequencies of
   gambling, smoking, drinking, and using marijuana by network members. We
   also found that alters tended to cluster together into two distinct
   groups: one cluster moderate-to-high on co-occurring addictive behavior
   and the other low on co-occurring addictive behavior. Lastly,
   significant differences were present when examining egos' perceptions of
   alters' substance use between the networks of at-risk, light, and
   nondrinkers.
   Conclusions: These findings provide empirical evidence of distinct
   clustering of addictive behavior among young adults and suggest the
   promise of social network-based interventions for this cohort Published

Abstract = {{The most constraining factor in goat production in the tropics is
   underfeeding mainly attributed to limitations of feed both in quantity
   and quality. This study was conducted to assess the effect of
   supplementing different levels of air-dried Moringa stenopetala leaf
   (MSL) as a protein source on nutrient intake and growth performances of
   Arsi-Bale male goats. A total of 24 yearling goats with average initial
   body weight of 13.6 +/- 0.25 kg were used in the study. The goats were
   blocked by live weight into four groups (n = 6 per group) and the groups
   were then randomly allocated into four supplemented treatments. All
   goats received a basal diet of natural grass hay ad libitum and 340
   g/head/day concentrate. The treatments were the control diet with no
   supplementation (Treatment 1, T1) and diets supplemented with MSL at a
   rate of 120 g/head/day (Treatment 2, T2), 170 g/head/day (Treatment 3,
   T3) and 220 g/head/day (Treatment 4, T4). The duration of the experiment
   was 75 days. The results indicated that the average daily feed intake
   was (p < 0.001) higher in goats supplemented with T3 and T4 diets. The
   total dry matter, organic matter, and crude protein intakes of goats fed
   with T3 and T4 supplementations were (p < 0.001) also higher than those
   reared in T1 and T2 diets. Goats reared in T3 and T4 diets had lower (p
   < 0.05) feed conversion ratio than those fed with T1 and T2 diets. The
   final body weight in goats reared in T3 and T4 diets was 18.2 kg and
   18.5 kg, respectively, being (p < 0.05) higher than those of T1 (15.8
   kg) and T2 (16.3 kg). The average daily weight gain in goats fed with T3
   and T4 diets was 111 and 114 g/goat/day, respectively, which was (p <
   0.05) higher than those reared in the control (T1) (54.0 g/goat/day) and
   T2 (58.1 g/goat/day) diets. It can thus be concluded that goats reared
   at high level of MSL supplementation (T3 and T4) had better nutrient
   intake, feed conversion efficiency and growth performances, suggesting
   its potential as a good protein supplement to natural grass hay at the
   farmer's management level.}},

   (longitudinal) injection of electrons. The revealed peculiarities of the

Abstract = {{The child care literature consistently reports a lack of support for

   This is despite consistent evidence of the long-term consequences of the

   explore the effects of separation, the subsequent sense of identity and
   the experience of contact and support throughout the process.
   Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven mothers recruited
   from birth mother support groups and the transcripts analysed using
   Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Four themes emerged: no
   one in my corner'; disconnecting from emotion; renegotiating identity;
   and the children are gone but still here. The findings contribute to our
   understanding of the experiences of birth mothers whose children are
   removed from their care and are discussed within a range of

Abstract = {{Purpose: MRF-TB (magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion targeted
   prostate biopsy) may improve the detection of prostate cancer in men
   presenting for prostate biopsy. We report clinical outcomes of 12-core
   systematic biopsy and MRF-TB in men who presented for primary biopsy and
   further describe pathological characteristics of cancers detected by
   systematic biopsy and not by MRF-TB.
   Materials and Methods: Clinical outcomes of 452 consecutive men who
   underwent prebiopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging followed
   by MRF-TB and systematic biopsy at our institution between June 2012 and
   June 2015 were captured in an institutional review board approved
   database. Clinical characteristics, biopsy results and magnetic
   resonance imaging suspicion scores were queried from the database.
   Results: Prostate cancer was detected in 207 of 382 men (54.2\%) with a
   mean SD age of 64 +/- 8.5 years and mean +/- SEM prostate specific
   antigen 6.8 +/- 0.3 ng/ml who met study inclusion criteria. The cancer
   detection rate of systematic biopsy and MRF-TB was 49.2\% and 43.5\%,
   respectively (p = 0.006). MRF-TB detected more Gleason score 7 or
   greater cancers than systematic biopsy (117 of 132 or 88.6\% vs 102 of
   132 or 77.3\%, p = 0.037). Of 41 cancers detected by systematic biopsy
   but not by MRF-TB 34 (82.9\%) demonstrated Gleason 6 disease, and 26
   (63.4\%) and 34 (82.9\%) were clinically insignificant by Epstein
   criteria and a UCSF CAPRA (University of California-San Francisco-Cancer
   of the Prostate Risk Assessment) score of 2 or less, respectively.
   Conclusions: In men presenting for primary prostate biopsy MRF-TB
   detects more high grade cancers than systematic biopsy. Most cancers
   detected by systematic biopsy and not by MRF-TB are at clinically low
   risk. Prebiopsy magnetic resonance imaging followed by MRF-TB decreases
   the detection of low risk cancers while significantly improving the
   detection and risk stratification of high grade disease.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a new approach to examining European chiton habitat
   use according to morphological characteristics. Time-search transects
   were conducted on four Portuguese rocky shores at two shore levels. The
   chiton species, abundance and individual morphometric features were
   recorded and related to the substratum dominant epiphytes and surface
   roughness. The chiton Lepidochitona cinerea (Linnaeus 1767) was the
   dominant species (77\%), followed by Leptochiton algesirensis (Capellini
   1859) (15\%) and Acanthochitona crinita (Pennant 1777) (8\%). Species
   abundance did not vary significantly with shore level or amongst shores.
   Six colour morphs were considered for Lepidochitona cinerea, four for A.
   crinita and one for Lepidochiton algesirensis. Substratum
   characteristics significantly explained the variation in species and
   colour morph distribution. There was a high correlation between the
   presence/absence and type of epiphytic algae and the substratum surface
   roughness level. We hypothesize that three mechanisms operating either
   independently or in interaction may explain the non-random distribution
   of colour polymorphisms according to their habitat characteristics: (i)
   presence of algae that are part of their diet; (ii) use of rock as
   shelter -for instance, crevices and cover resulting from algae fronds
   and; (iii) morph-rock colour matching as a camouflage mechanism to
   reduce predation pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Listeria monocytogenes is considered one of the most important foodborne
   pathogens. The virulence-related proteins listeriolysin O (LLO) and p60
   are critical factors involved in Listeria pathogenesis. In the present
   study, we investigated the effect of honokiol on LLO and p60 secreted
   from L. monocytogenes. A listeriolysin assay was used to investigate the
   haemolytic activities of L. monocytogenes exposed to honokiol, and the
   secretion of LLO and p60 was detected by immunoblot analysis.
   Additionally, the influence of honokiol on the transcription of LLO and
   p60 genes (hly and iap, respectively) was analysed by real-time reverse
   transcription PCR. TNF-alpha release assays were performed to elucidate
   the biological relevance of changes in LLO and p60 secretion induced by
   honokiol. According to the data, honokiol showed good anti-L.
   monocytogenes activity, with MICs of 8-16 mu g ml(-1), and the secretion
   of LLO and p60 was decreased by honokiol. In addition, the transcription
   of hly and iap was inhibited by honokiol. Our results indicate that
   TNF-alpha production by RAW264.7 cells stimulated with L. monocytogenes
   supernatants was inhibited by honokiol. Based on these data, we propose
   that honokiol could be used as a promising natural compound against L.
   monocytogenes and its virulence factors.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the de-noising effects of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) log echo data, this paper applies the
   wavelet packet threshold algorithm to the data. The principle of the
   algorithm is elaborated in detail. By comparing the properties of a
   series of wavelet packet bases and the relevance between them and the
   NMR log echo train signal, `sym7' is found to be the optimal wavelet
   packet basis of the wavelet packet threshold algorithm to de-noise the
   NMR log echo train signal. A new method is presented to determine the
   optimal wavelet packet decomposition scale; this is within the scope of
   its maximum, using the modulus maxima and the Shannon entropy minimum
   standards to determine the global and local optimal wavelet packet
   decomposition scales, respectively. The results of applying the method
   to the simulated and actual NMR log echo data indicate that compared
   with the wavelet threshold algorithm, the wavelet packet threshold
   algorithm, which shows higher decomposition accuracy and better
   de-noising effect, is much more suitable for de-noising low SNR-NMR log
   echo data.}},

Abstract = {{Human sterile alpha motif domain-containing 9 ( SAMD9) protein is a host
   restriction factor for poxviruses, but it can be overcome by some
   poxvirus host-range proteins that share homology with vaccinia virus C7
   protein. To understand the mechanism of action for this important family
   of host-range factors, we determined the crystal structures of C7 and
   myxoma virus M64, a C7 family member that is unable to antagonize SAMD9.
   Despite their different functions and only 23\% sequence identity, the
   two proteins have very similar overall structures, displaying a
   previously unidentified fold comprised of a compact 12-stranded
   antiparallel beta-sandwich wrapped in two short a helices. Extensive
   structure-guided mutagenesis of C7 identified three loops clustered on
   one edge of the beta sandwich as critical for viral replication and
   binding with SAMD9. The loops are characterized with functionally
   important negatively charged, positively charged, and hydrophobic
   residues, respectively, together forming a unique ``three-fingered
   molecular claw.{''} The key residues of the claw are not conserved in
   two C7 family members that do not antagonize SAMD9 but are conserved in
   distantly related C7 family members from four poxvirus genera that
   infect diverse mammalian species. Indeed, we found that all in the
   latter group of proteins bind SAMD9. Taken together, our data indicate
   that diverse mammalian poxviruses use a conserved molecular claw in a
   C7-like protein to target SAMD9 and overcome host restriction.}},

Abstract = {{This technical note presents a detailed field study to investigate the

   screw-shaped shaft in Shanghai soft clay. Horizontal soil displacements
   and pore water pressures were measured in the vicinity of two DD piles

   consolidation periods. The results show that the horizontal soil
   displacements induced by the installation of a DD pile with a
   screw-shaped shaft are mainly concentrated within a circular region with
   a radius smaller than six times the pile external diameter and that the
   maximum horizontal soil displacements decrease by 10-20\% one day after
   concreting and then tend to be stable. The excess pore water pressures
   reach their maximum when the drilling rod reaches the design depth or
   the concreting is completed and then start to decrease with time
   following approximately an exponential decay function. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Key working is a way of supporting children and young people with
   special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and their families,

   of key working in four sites in England, with a particular focus on the
   SEND policy reforms. Key working resulted in a number of positive
   outcomes for children and young people, families and services, including
   helping services to meet the requirements of the SEND reforms.
   Challenging aspects included managing transitions and the relationship
   between key working practitioner and family, but successful strategies
   were identified. Key working supports the implementation of specific
   aspects of the English SEND reforms along with more general cultural
   change in services to align with families' needs and well-established

Abstract = {{Specialty animal fibers are commercially valuable since they
   significantly enhance the comfort properties of apparel products. As
   they help to create niche products, use of special animal fibers has
   increased significantly. There are many types of specialty fibers, such
   as cashmere, mohair, alpaca, and angora rabbit fibers, that are natural,
   ecological, and sustainable. Each of them has distinguishing properties
   and increases the added value of garments. In this work, five different
   specialty animal fibers and wool were sourced from four different
   countries. Yarns were spun using two different spinning systems. In the
   first method, to spin the yarns in a short staple spinning system,
   animal fibers were blended with viscose fibers. In the second method, to
   produce fabrics from 100\% animal fibers, core yarn spinning system was
   used. Later, the yarns were knitted in a single jersey structure. After
   the production of all fabrics, handle properties such as surface
   friction, stiffness, and prickliness were tested by using both
   subjective and objective measurement techniques. To measure inherent
   fabric prickle, a new objective measurement technique was developed.
   Subjective and objective evaluation results highly correlate and it is
   pointed out that the new technique could be an alternative method to
   test fabric prickliness. Fabrics produced from silk, angora, and
   cashmere fibers are found to have the smoothest, softest, and least
   prickly surfaces among the other researched fibers.}},

Abstract = {{Many people living in low-and middle-income countries are not covered by
   civil registration and vital statistics systems. Consequently, a wide
   variety of other types of data, including many household sample surveys,
   are used to estimate health and population indicators. In this paper we
   combine data from sample surveys and demographic surveillance systems to
   produce small area estimates of child mortality through time. Small area
   estimates are necessary to understand geographical heterogeneity in
   health indicators when full-coverage vital statistics are not available.
   For this endeavor spatio-temporal smoothing is beneficial to alleviate
   problems of data sparsity. The use of conventional hierarchical models
   requires careful thought since the survey weights may need to be
   considered to alleviate bias due to nonrandom sampling and nonresponse.
   The application that motivated this work is an estimation of child
   mortality rates in five-year time intervals in regions of Tanzania. Data
   come from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted over the period
   1991-2010 and two demographic surveillance system sites. We derive a
   variance estimator of under five years child mortality that accounts for
   the complex survey weighting. For our application, the hierarchical
   models we consider include random effects for area, time and survey and
   we compare models using a variety of measures including the conditional
   predictive ordinate (CPO). The method we propose is implemented via the
   fast and accurate integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA).}},

Title = {{Listening for the ``Still Small Voice{''} of Mendelssohn's Domestic
   Elijah}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{40-77}},

Abstract = {{The notion that there might be autobiographical, or personally
   confessional, registers at work in Mendelssohn's 1846 Elijah has long
   been established, with three interpretive approaches prevailing: the
   first, famously advanced by Prince Albert, compares Mendelssohn's own
   artistic achievements with Elijah's prophetic ones; the second, in Eric
   Werner's dramatic formulation, discerns in the aria ``It is enough{''} a
   confession of Mendelssohn's own ``weakening will to live{''}; the third
   portrays Elijah as a testimonial on Mendelssohn's relationship to the
   Judaism of his birth and/or to the Christianity of his youth and
   adulthood.
   This article explores a fourth, essentially untested, interpretive
   approach: the possibility that Mendelssohn crafts from Elijah's story a
   heartfelt affirmation of domesticity, an expression of his growing
   fascination with retiring to a quiet existence in the bosom of his
   family..
   The argument unfolds in three phases. In the first, the focus is on that
   climactic passage in Elijah's Second Part in which God is revealed to
   the prophet in the ``still small voice.{''} The turn from divine absence
   to divine presence is articulated through two clear and powerful
   recollections of music that Elijah had sung in the oratorio's First
   Part, a move that has the potential to reconfigure our evaluation of his
   role in the public and private spheres in those earlier passages. The
   second phase turns to Elijah's own brief sojourn into the domestic
   realm, the widow's scene, paying particular attention to the motivations
   that may have underlain the substantial revisions to the scene that took
   place between the Birmingham premiere and the London premiere the
   following year. The final phase explores the possibility that the widow
   and her son, the ``surrogate family{''} in the oratorio, do not
   disappear after the widow's scene, but linger on as
   ``para-characters{''} with crucial roles in the unfolding drama.}},

Abstract = {{Mouse models are extremely important in studying cardiac pathologies and
   related electrophysiology, but very few mouse ECG analysis programs are
   readily available. Therefore, a mouse ECG analysis algorithm was
   developed and validated. Surface ECG (lead II) was acquired during
   transthoracic echocardiography from C57Bl/6J mice under isoflurane
   anesthesia. The effect of aging was studied in young (2-3 months),
   middle-aged (14 months) and old (20-24 months) mice. The ECG changes
   associated with pharmacological interventions and common cardiac
   pathologies, that is, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and progressive
   left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), were studied. The ECG raw data were
   analyzed with an in-house ECG analysis program, modified specially for
   mouse ECG. Aging led to increases in P-wave duration, atrioventricular
   conduction time (PQ interval), and intraventricular conduction time (QRS
   complex width), while the R-wave amplitude decreased. In addition, the
   prevalence of arrhythmias increased during aging. Anticholinergic
   atropine shortened PQ time, and beta blocker metoprolol and
   calcium-channel blocker verapamil increased PQ interval and decreased
   heart rate. The ECG changes after AMI included early JT elevation,
   development of Q waves, decreased R-wave amplitude, and later changes in
   JT/T segment. In progressive LVH model, QRS complex width was increased
   at 2 and especially 4 weeks timepoint, and also repolarization
   abnormalities were seen. Aging, drugs, AMI, and LVH led to similar ECG
   changes in mice as seen in humans, which could be reliably detected with
   this new algorithm. The developed method will be very useful for studies
   on cardiovascular diseases in mice.}},

Abstract = {{Studies conducted during 2009-2013 at the Experimental Orchard located
   in the central region of Poland showed that the highest number of V.
   inaequalis pseudothecia occurred on `'McIntosh' and `Cortland' leaves. A
   smaller number of pseudothecia was found on the leaves of the Alwa and
   Jonagold cultivars, but there were no statistical differences. The first
   discharges of ascospores were noted at a similar time on the leaves of
   all of the apple cultivars, usually at the end of March or in early
   April. For the forecasting of ascospore discharges and dates of critical
   periods, a simulation model by RIMpro was used. The number of critical
   periods and apple scab severity differed in each season. The most
   critical periods (above 20) were recorded in 2010 and 2013, which also
   corresponded with a high severity of apple scab. The number of infected
   leaves and fruits on the untreated trees of the very susceptible
   cultivar McIntosh reached nearly 100\% during these seasons. In other
   years, the severity of the disease on the same apple trees was lower and
   amounted to 30-54\% of infected leaves and 23-80\% of infected fruits.}},

Abstract = {{Aims/hypothesis The aim of this work was to test whether the
   mid-adolescent peak in insulin resistance (IR) and trends in other
   metabolic markers are influenced by long-term exposure to physical
   activity.
   Methods Physical activity (7 day ActiGraph accelerometry), HOMA-IR and
   other metabolic markers (glucose, fasting insulin, HbA(1c), lipids and
   BP) were measured annually from age 9 years to 16 years in 300 children
   (151 boys) from the EarlyBird study in Plymouth, UK. The activity level
   of each child was characterised, with 95\% reliability, by averaging
   their eight annual physical activity measures. Age-related trends in IR
   and metabolic health were analysed by multi-level modelling, with
   physical activity as the exposure measure (categorical and continuous)
   and body fat percentage (assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry)
   and pubertal status (according to age at peak height velocity and Tanner
   stage) as covariates.
   Results The peak in IR at age 12-13 years was 17\% lower (p < 0.001) in
   the more active adolescents independently of body fat percentage and
   pubertal status. However, this difference diminished progressively over
   the next 3 years and had disappeared completely by the age of 16 years
   (e.g. difference was -14\% at 14 years, -8\% at 15 years and +1\% at 16
   years; `physical activity x age(2)' interaction, p < 0.01).
   Triacylglycerol levels in girls (-9.7\%, p = 0.05) and diastolic blood
   pressure in boys (-1.20 mmHg, p = 0.03) tended to be lower throughout
   adolescence in the more active group.
   Conclusions/interpretation Our finding that physical activity attenuates
   IR during mid-adolescence may be clinically important. It remains to be
   established whether the temporary attenuation in IR during this period
   has implications for the development of diabetes in adolescence and for
   future metabolic health generally.}},

Abstract = {{Amyand's hernia is an inguinal hernia that contains vermiform appendix
   in its sac. It consists 1 \% of all inguinal hernias while appendicitis
   in an Amyand's hernia accounts for 0.1 \% of all appendicitis cases. Its
   clinical image is identical to that of an incarcerated or perforated
   inguinal hernia. Diagnosis is usually established intraoperatively.
   Hernioplasty (with or without mesh repair and with or without
   appendectomy) is the treatment of choice. According to Losannof and
   Basson's criteria, performance of appendectomy shall depend on vermiform
   appendix's inflammation status. In this case series, authors present
   three patients who had to undergo prophylactic appendectomy because of
   medical conditions, unrelated to appendix's inflammation status thus
   escaping from therapeutic frame set by Losanoff and Basson's criteria.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Hydraulic structures constitute the most vulnerable elements of
   transportation infrastructure. Recent increases in precipitation have
   resulted in severe and more frequent flash flooding incidents. This has
   put bridges over waterways at higher risk of failure due to scour. This
   study presents a new sensor for measuring scour depth variation and
   sediment deposition processes in the vicinity of the foundations to
   underpin systems for early warning of impending structural failure. The
   monitoring system consists of a probe with integrated electromagnetic
   sensors designed to detect changes in the dielectric permittivity of the
   surrounding bridge foundation. The probe is equipped with a wireless
   interface and was evaluated to assess its ability to detect scour and
   sediment deposition in various soil types and under temperature and
   water salinity conditions that would commonly occur in a practical
   installation environment. A novel methodology is also developed enabling
   discrimination between in situ and re-deposited sediment delivering
   vital information about the load bearing capacity of the foundation. The
   experimental approach was validated using `static' scour simulations and
   real-time open channel flume experiments. Results indicate that the
   sensor is highly sensitive to underwater bed level variations and can
   provide an economical and accurate structural health monitoring
   alternative to existing instruments.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{711-724}},

Abstract = {{The interest in micro-technologies has increased in the last decades,
   because of the low volumes and high performance granted by their
   application. Micro-fins can find application in several fields, such as
   power electronics, concentrating photovoltaics and LED. Although
   micro-technologies have been widely applied in cooling, there is still a
   lack of knowledge on the thermal behavior of micro-finned heat sinks
   under natural convective conditions. In the present study, the
   correspondences between fin geometries and heat transfer coefficients,
   as well as the effects of the orientation, are experimentally
   investigated using silicon micro-finned heat sinks with different
   geometries. The heat sinks are made of 5 cm x 5 cm squared silicon wafer
   and the fin height ranges between 0.6 mm and 0.8 mm, the spacing between
   0.2 mm and 0.8 mm and the thickness between 0.2 and 0.8 mm. Power loads
   higher than those considered in previous works are studied. The
   experimental setup is validated using a software simulation and the
   Nusselt number correlation available in literature. The influence of the
   fin thickness on this parameter is analyzed and a modified correlation
   is proposed. Also, the effect of the radiative heat exchange on the
   overall heat transfer is considered and commented. An analysis of the
   uncertainty is conducted and reported too. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Flumequine is a quinolone derivative used in veterinary medicine to
   treat enteric infections, mainly those caused by Gram negative bacteria
   and also some Gram positive. Some recent reports by field practitioners
   have suggested that its use in swine dysentery outbreaks can minimize
   the impact of this disease. This study aims to evaluate the in vitro
   anti-Brachyspira hyodysenteriae activity of flumequine. Forty eight
   field isolates of the bacterium were evaluated using a microdilution
   test. The lack of colon bioavailability studies of flumequine in pigs
   makes it difficult to establish the true efficacy of this antibiotic for
   swine dysentery control. Nonetheless, the relatively high values of
   MIC50 (50 mu g/mL) and MBC50 (50 mu g/mL) obtained suggest poor activity
   against B. hyodysenteriae. Flumequine activity in swine dysentery
   outbreaks could be related to its activity against other bacteria,
   different from B. hyodysenteriae, engaged in swine dysentery
   pathogenesis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   introduces a sensitivity to probability-conferring empirical and

Abstract = {{Context: Current guidelines recommend annual discontinuation of
   postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) to evaluate whether a woman could
   manage without the treatment. The impact of HT on cardiovascular health
   has been widely studied, but it is not known how the withdrawal of HT
   affects cardiovascular risk.
   Objective: We evaluated the risk of cardiac or stroke death after the
   discontinuation of HT.
   Design, Patients, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measures: Altogether
   332 202 Finnish women discontinuing HT between 1994 and 2009 (data from
   National Reimbursement register) were followed up from the
   discontinuation date to death due to cardiac cause (n = 3177) or stroke
   (n = 1952), or to the end of 2009. The deaths, retrieved from the
   national Cause of Death Register, were compared with the expected number
   of deaths in the age-standardized background population. In a
   subanalysis we also compared HT stoppers with HT users.
   Results: Within the first posttreatment year, the risk of cardiac death
   was significantly elevated (standardized mortality ratio; 95\%
   confidence interval 1.26; 1.16-1.37), whereas follow-up for longer than
   1 year was accompanied with a reduction (0.75; 0.72-0.78). The risk of
   stroke death in the first posttreatment year was increased (1.63;
   1.47-1.79), but follow-up for longer than 1 year was accompanied with a
   reduced risk (0.89; 0.85-0.94). The cardiac (2.30; 2.12-2.50) and stroke
   (2.52; 2.28-2.77) death risk elevations were even higher when compared
   with HT users. In women who discontinued HT at age younger than 60
   years, but not in women aged 60 years or older, the cardiac mortality
   risk was elevated (1.94; 1.51-2.48).
   Conclusions: Increased cardiovascular death risks question the safety of
   annual HT discontinuation practice to evaluate whether a woman could
   manage without HT.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of a ``learning health care system{''} one that systematically
   integrates clinical research with medical care has received considerable
   attention recently. Some commentators argue that under certain
   conditions pragmatic comparative effectiveness randomized trials can be
   conducted ethically within the context of a learning health care system
   without the informed consent of patients for research participation. In
   this article, we challenge this perspective and contend that conducting
   randomized trials of individual treatment options without consent is
   neither necessary nor desirable to promote and sustain learning health
   care systems. Our argument draws on the normative conception of personal
   care developed by Charles Fried in a landmark 1974 book on the ethics of

Abstract = {{A full-scale experimental site with four energy test piles was built on
   the campus of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne,
   Switzerland. This site was used to investigate interaction effects
   within a group of energy piles. First, the ground constraints were
   evaluated by testing the piles without any structure on top. Next, each
   pile was individually tested once the overlying structure was built,
   which provided information on the structural constraints and allowed the
   quantification of the pile-structure-pile interactions. Finally, the
   four test piles were simultaneously heated to quantify the group
   effects. A thermal response test was performed on one pile and the
   thermohydraulic response of the soil between the piles was monitored
   with piezometers and thermistors. Load redistributions may occur in
   mixed foundations, i.e., with conventional and energy piles, because of
   differential displacements. Conversely, heating an entire foundation
   increases the individual pile displacements, but reduces the
   differential displacements and consequently the pile thermal efforts.
   Radial strains may also have a significant impact on the axial
   thermomechanical response of the piles in stiff soil layers. Heat barely
   propagated farther than a couple of metres with no significant
   pore-water pressure variation observed.}},

   working in community mental health centers, and to identify the
   adaptation processes used to resolve the issues. Methods: Data were
   collected through in-depth interviews between December 2013 and August
   2014. Participants were 11 PCMHNP working in community mental health
   centers. Analysis was done using the grounded theory methodology. The
   first question was ``How did you start working at a community mental
   health center; what were the difficulties you faced during your
   employment and how did you resolve them?{''} Results: The core category
   was regulating within relationships.' The adaptation process was
   categorized into three sequential stages: `nesting,' `hanging around the
   nest,' and `settling into the nest.' Various action/interaction
   strategies were employed in these stages. The adaptation results from
   using these strategies were `psychiatric nursing within life' and `a
   long way to go.' Conclusion: The results of this study are significant
   as they aid in understanding the psychosocial adaptation processes of
   PCMHNP working in community mental health centers, and indicate areas to
   be addressed in the future in order for PCMHNP to fulfill their
   professional role in the local community.}},

Abstract = {{As aflatoxin B-1 is one of the most toxic mycotoxins, it is important to
   detect and to quantify aflatoxin B-1 accurately by immunological
   methods. To enhance aflatoxin B-1-binding affinity of the single-chain
   variable fragment, yeast surface display technique combined with
   fluorescence-activated cell sorting was applied. A randomly mutated scFv
   library was subjected to 4 rounds of fluorescence-activated cell
   sorting, resulting in isolation of 5 scFv variants showing an affinity
   improvement compared to the parental wild type scFv. The best scFv with
   a 9-fold improvement in affinity for aflatoxin B-1 exhibited similar
   specificity to the monoclonal antibody. Most of the mutations in
   scFv-M37 were located outside of the canonical antigen-contact loops,
   suggesting that its affinity improvement might be driven by an
   allosteric effect inducing scFv-M37 to form a more favorable binding
   pocket for aflatoxin B-1 than the wild type scFv. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   Chest Pain}},
Journal = {{MEDICINE}},

Volume = {{94}},

Abstract = {{Baseline impedance (BI) measurement can be used to evaluate the status
   of the esophageal mucosa integrity. We hypothesized that impaired
   esophageal mucosal integrity may play a causative role in patients with
   nongastroesophageal reflux disease (non-GERD)-related noncardiac chest
   pain (NCCP). This retrospective study analyzed 24-hour multichannel
   intraluminal impedance-pH testing data from 77 patients with NCCP and 5
   healthy volunteers. BI was calculated at 3 cm (distal esophagus) and 17
   cm (proximal esophagus) above the lower esophageal sphincter. GERD was
   defined by the presence of pathologic acid exposure or reflux
   esophagitis. Among the 77 patients with NCCP, 16 (20.8\%) were
   classified into the GERD-related NCCP group and 61 (79.2\%) into the
   non-GERD-related NCCP group. BI (median, inter-quartile range) of the
   non-GERD-related NCCP group was lower than the control group at the
   proximal esophagus (2507 Omega, 2156-3217 vs 3855 Omega, 3238-4182, P =
   0.001) but was similar at the distal esophagus. The GERD-related NCCP
   group showed lower BI than the control group at both the distal and
   proximal esophagus (2024 Omega, 1619-2308 vs 3203 Omega, 2366-3774, P =
   0.007 and 2272 Omega, 1896-2908 vs 3855 Omega, 3238-4182, P = 0.003,
   respectively). At the distal esophagus, BI was lower in the GERD-related
   NCCP group than the non-GERD-related NCCP group (P = 0.002), whereas it
   did not differ between the 2 groups at the proximal esophagus. In
   conclusion, the mucosal integrity is impaired at the proximal esophagus
   in patients with non-GERD-related NCCP, which might be the pathogenic
   mechanism of NCCP.}},

Abstract = {{A thermally-activated constitutive model is developed based on
   dislocation interactions, crystallographic orientations and
   microstructural evolution to describe the elasto-plastic stress strain
   behavior during multi-axial loading. The aim is to contribute to the
   quantification of complex strain path response in solid solution
   strengthened alloys. In detail, dislocation/dislocation interactions are
   incorporated in the model to quantify latent and kinematic hardening
   phenomena during loading path changes. Dislocation density-based
   constitutive relations are included to account for dislocation features
   such as dislocation forests, walls and channels. Moreover,
   dislocation/solute atom interactions are also considered in order to
   account for both dynamic and static strain aging as well as static
   recovery. The model is validated against multiple multi-axial data sets
   for AA5754-0 with changes of loading path and various degrees of
   pre-strain and time intervals between tests. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Alexander Disease (AxD) is a gliopathy caused by toxic, dominant
   gain-of-function mutations in the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
   gene. Two distinct types of AxD exist. Type I AxD affected individuals
   develop cerebral symptoms by 4 years of age and suffer from
   macrocephaly, seizures, and physical and mental delays. As detection and
   diagnosis have improved, approximately half of all AxD patients
   diagnosed have onset >4 years and brainstem/spinal cord involvement.
   Type II AxD patients experience ataxia, palatal myoclonus, dysphagia,
   and dysphonia. No study has examined a mechanistic link between the GFAP
   mutations and caudal symptoms present in type II AxD patients. We
   demonstrate that two key astrocytic functions, the ability to regulate
   extracellular glutamate and to take up K+ via K+ channels, are
   compromised in hindbrain regions and spinal cord in AxD mice. Spinal
   cord astrocytes in AxD transgenic mice are depolarized relative to WT
   littermates, and have a three-fold reduction in Ba2+-sensitive Kir4.1
   mediated currents and six-fold reduction in glutamate uptake currents.
   The loss of these two functions is due to significant decreases in
   Kir4.1 (>70\%) and GLT-1 (>60\%) protein expression. mRNA expression for
   KCNJ10 and SLC1A2, the genes that code for Kir4.1 and GLT-1, are
   significantly reduced by postnatal Day 7. Protein and mRNA reductions
   for Kir4.1 and GLT-1 are exacerbated in AxD models that demonstrate
   earlier accumulation of GFAP and increased Rosenthal fiber formation.
   These findings provide a mechanistic link between the GFAP
   mutations/overexpression and the symptoms in those affected with Type II
   AxD.}},

Abstract = {{This essay aims to critically examine body politics, which characterize

   of our current inter-Korean situation, wherein South Korea's cultural
   superiority to North Korea is unquestionably presumed and legitimized. I
   discuss what I call the biopolitical Otherization of North Korea, which
   I define as the discursive formation of the incessant purification of
   degenerate, inferior North Korean populations along the lines of the
   problematic formation of national belonging. This discursive politics of
   Otherizing is located within the allegorical composition of eyewitness
   reports of North Koreans written by South Korean reporters during the
   historic first official post-war inter-Korea talks-emerging from the
   ``July 4 North-South Joint Communique{''}-held in Pyongyang from 29
   August to 2 September 1972, which hinder the subject's ability to
   deliberate anxieties about national identification.}},

   larval morphology, sharing several unique larval characters (e.g.,
   bidentate nasale in the first instar, presence of numerous additional
   setae on parietale in the first instar), which support their close
   phylogenetic relationship and provides morphological support for the
   transfer of Anticura to the Rygmodinae. The presence of numerous
   additional setae on the parietale of all instars and characteristic
   chaetotaxy of the maxillary stipes are hypothesized as potential larval
   synapomorphies of the subfamily Rygmodinae. Field observations show that

Abstract = {{Li-7(p,n)Be-7 is an endothermic reaction and working near its threshold
   (1.88 MeV) has the advantage of neutron spectra with maximum energies of
   about 100 keV, considerably lower than at higher beam energies, or than
   using other neutron-producing reactions or as for the uranium fission
   spectrum, relevant for BNCT based on nuclear reactors. With this primary
   energy it is much easier to obtain the energies needed for treating deep
   seated tumors by BNCT (about 10 key). This work studies bombarding
   energies up to 2.05 MeV, different beam incidence angles and the effect
   of the undesirable gamma production via the Li-7(p,gamma p') Li-7

Abstract = {{In this study we show that incentives (dog collars and owner wristbands)
   are effective at increasing owner participation in mass dog rabies
   vaccination clinics and we conclude that household questionnaire surveys
   and the mark-re-sight (transect survey) method for estimating
   post-vaccination coverage are accurate when all dogs, including puppies,
   are included. Incentives were distributed during central-point rabies
   vaccination clinics in northern Tanzania to quantify their effect on
   owner participation. In villages where incentives were handed out
   participation increased, with an average of 34 more dogs being
   vaccinated. Through economies of scale, this represents a reduction in
   the cost-per-dog of \$ 0.47. This represents the price-threshold under
   which the cost of the incentive used must fall to be economically
   viable. Additionally, vaccination coverage levels were determined in ten
   villages through the gold-standard village-wide census technique, as
   well as through two cheaper and quicker methods (randomized household
   questionnaire and the transect survey). Cost data were also collected.
   Both non-gold standard methods were found to be accurate when puppies
   were included in the calculations, although the transect survey and the
   household questionnaire survey over-and under-estimated the coverage
   respectively. Given that additional demographic data can be collected
   through the household questionnaire survey, and that its estimate of
   coverage is more conservative, we recommend this method. Despite the use
   of incentives the average vaccination coverage was below the 70\%
   threshold for eliminating rabies. We discuss the reasons and suggest
   solutions to improve coverage. Given recent international targets to
   eliminate rabies, this study provides valuable and timely data to help
   improve mass dog vaccination programs in Africa and elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{The standard Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) invented by F. Sauli {[}1]

   Multiplier, fabricated using the same wet chemical etch process at CERN.
   It was possible to sustain charge gains of 3 x 10(3) and 1 x 10(4) using
   single and double stage configurations, respectively, operated in an
   Ar(70\%)-CO2(30\%) gas mixture. These values are similar to those
   achieved with standard GEMs. Crucially, we found that the thicker GEM is
   more robust as it withstood sparking without catastrophic failure. We
   also measured the gain dependence on ambient variables such as pressure
   and temperature and found the gain sensitivity to be 4.0 K/mbar,
   compared with 1.55 K/mbar for the standard GEM.}},

Abstract = {{Fixation of subtrochanteric fracture, even for experienced surgeons, is
   a challenge. This fracture is most difficult to treat, and the incidence
   of complications in this type of fracture is higher. This study compared
   surgical results of two methods, proximal femur locking compression
   plate and intramedullary locking nail. This is an analytic study,
   performed on all patients with subtrochanteric fracture who were
   referred to the hospital during 3 years. They were treated with proximal
   femur locking plate or intramedullary locking nail. The postoperative
   complications were evaluated and recorded. Finally, the data were
   analyzed by SPSS software. Complications were studied in both groups.
   Neither treatment has statistically significant difference in
   complications, onset of complications incidence, and time of full-weight
   bearing. Although the Harris Hip Score among patients improved in both
   methods of treatment, there is no significant difference between the two
   groups. The results of subtrochanteric fracture fixation by
   intramedullary or locking plate were similar and had the same outcome.}},

Title = {{New insights on the physics of salt precipitation during injection of
   CO2 into saline aquifers}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{10-21}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Salt precipitation associated with injection of dry CO2 into saline
   aquifers has caused reduced injectivity at CO2 storage sites such as
   Ketzin and Snehvit. The present-day reservoir scale models of this
   phenomenon include processes such as evaporation of water into CO2 and
   capillary backflow of water into the dried zone, and have the salt
   formation up-scaled to grid-size. However, salt precipitation via these
   mechanisms has been suggested to only fill a fraction of the pore
   network and to not significantly affect the permeability. We report
   lab-on-chip experiments to provide new insights into the dynamics of
   salt precipitation at the pore-scale and also to find the possible
   explanations for the large-scale salt precipitation observed in the
   field. The results of this study introduce two interrelated and so far
   unreported phenomena -self-enhancing of salt growth and water film salt
   transport - which together dramatically intensify the precipitation rate
   and amount of salt precipitated. Our experiments demonstrate that salt
   crystals, although at different rates, grow in both the liquid and gas
   phases. Aggregates of micrometer sized crystals in the gas phase create
   a micro-porous medium with massive capillarity that can strongly imbibe
   brine over long distances to the evaporation front via capillary
   connected water films. The imbibed brine in the salt structure is
   several orders of magnitude thinner than trapped brine in the pores, and
   due to its high surface area to volume ratio, it rapidly becomes highly
   super-saturated, leading to a high nucleation rate and the formation of
   additional salt crystals. The produced salt provides additional surface
   area for evaporation, and therefore enhances the overall rate of
   precipitation. This mechanism is active even at extreme CO2 flow rates
   and therefore salt formation could be more severe than previously
   concluded, which was based only on core flooding experiments and
   numerical simulations. The paper raises a serious need for
   reconsideration of the currently implemented physics in the simulation
   tools and also for properly designed laboratory experiments, to ensure
   that the reservoir volume outside the drainage area, which over time
   contributes to the bulk of precipitated salt, is also included. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{When 1 < p < infinity, maps f in W-1/p.p((0, 1); S-1) have W-1/p,W-p
   phases phi, but the W-1/p,W-p-seminorm of phi is not controlled by the
   one of f. Lack of control is illustrated by ``the kink{''}: f = e'(phi),
   where the phase phi moves quickly from 0 to 2 pi. A similar situation
   occurs for maps f : S-1 -> S-1, with Moebius maps playing the role of
   kinks. We prove that this is the only loss of control mechanism: each
   map f : S-1 -> S-1 satisfying vertical bar f vertical bar(p)(W1/p.p) <=
   M can be written as f = e('Psi) (K)Pi(j=1)(M-aj)(+/-1), where M-aj is a
   Moebius map vanishing at a(j) is an element of D, while the integer K =
   K(f) and the phase Psi are controlled by M. In particular, we have K <=
   c(p) M for some c(p). When p = 2, we obtain the sharp value of c(2),
   which is c(2) = 1/(4 pi(2)). As an application, we obtain the existence
   of minimal maps of degree one in W-1/p.p (S-1; S-1) with p is an element

Abstract = {{Purpose: White matter fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure suggesting
   microstructure, is significantly underestimated with single diffusion
   tensor model at crossing-fiber regions (CFR). We propose a
   tract-specific FA (TSFA), corrected for the effects of crossing-fiber
   geometry and free water at CFR, and adapted for tract analysis with
   diffusion MRI (dMRI) in clinical research.
   Methods: At CFR voxels, the proposed technique estimates free water
   fraction (f(iso)) as a linear function of mean apparent diffusion
   coefficient (mADC), fits the dual tensors and estimates TSFA. Digital
   phantoms were designed for testing the accuracy of f(iso) and fitted
   dual-anisotropies at CFR. The technique was applied to clinical dMRI of
   normal subjects and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) patients to test
   the effectiveness of TSFA.
   Results: Phantom simulation showed unbiased estimates of dual-tensor
   anisotropies at CFR and high accuracy of f(iso) as a linear function of
   mADC. TSFA at CFR was highly consistent to the single tensor FA at
   non-CFR within the same tract with normal human dMRI. Additional HSP
   imaging biomarkers with significant correlation to clinical motor
   function scores could be identified with TSFA.
   Conclusion: Results suggest the potential of the proposed technique in
   estimating unbiased TSFA at CFR and conducting tract analysis in
   clinical research. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Music plays a prominent role in society and companies have even started
   studying its aspects for commercial purposes. It is only natural to ask
   what characteristics make certain songs appealing. While much research
   has been conducted on the mathematical principles of sound, there has
   been less focus on analyzing the structure of popular songs from a
   mathematical perspective. One mathematical tool that researchers have
   used to study musical structure is seriation, ordering. This paper
   applies several types of seriation algorithms to conduct a mathematical
   analysis of the structural qualities of several musical pieces. This
   paper focuses on 10 popular artists and their musical influences. The
   artists chosen for this research are linked because of the influences
   they cite, musical genre, and the popularity of their music. Results
   show that an artist's songs have a higher quantitatively measured
   connection with the artists they cite as influences rather than the
   artists who they never mention as musical influences.}},

Abstract = {{Tributyltin (TBT), a well-known endocrine disruptor, is an omnipresent
   environmental pollutant and is explicitly used in many industrial
   applications. Previously we have shown its neurotoxic potential on
   cerebral cortex of male Wistar rats. As the effect of TBT on other brain
   regions is not known, we planned this study to evaluate its effect on
   four brain regions (cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and
   striatum). Four-week-old male Wistar rats were gavaged with a single
   dose of TBT-chloride (TBTC) (10, 20, and 30 mg/kg) and sacrificed on
   days 3 and 7, respectively. Effect of TBTC on blood-brain barrier (BBB)
   permeability and tin (Sn) accumulation were measured. Oxidative stress
   indexes such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced and oxidized
   glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio, lipid peroxidation, and protein
   carbonylation were analyzed as they play an imperative role in various
   neuropathological conditions. Since metal catalyzed reactions are a
   major source of oxidant generation, levels of essential metals like iron
   (Fe), zinc (Zn), and calcium (Ca) were estimated. We found that TBTC
   disrupted BBB and increased Sn accumulation, both of which appear
   significantly correlated. Altered metal homeostasis and ROS generation
   accompanied by elevated lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation
   indicated oxidative damage which appeared more pronounced in the
   striatum than in cerebellum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. This could
   be associated to the depleted GSH levels in striatum. These results
   suggest that striatum is more susceptible to TBTC induced oxidative
   damage as compared with other brain regions under study. (C) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{Accumulating evidence has shown the pathophysiological significance of
   the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) in the central nervous system. In
   this study, we evaluated the beneficial effects of ONO-2952, a novel
   TSPO antagonist in rat stress models. ONO-2952 potently bound both rat
   and human TSPO (Ki = 0.330-930 nmol/L) with high selectivity over other
   receptors, transporters, ion channels and enzymes. ONO-2952 inhibited
   both neurosteroid accumulation and noradrenaline release in the brain of
   rats exposed to acute stress. The inhibitory effect of ONO-2952 on
   stress-induced noradrenaline release was attenuated by co-treatment with
   the TSPO agonist CB34 in a dose-dependent manner. ONO-2952, at 0.3 mg/kg
   or higher, dose-dependently suppressed restraint stress-induced
   defecation in rats with brain TSPO occupancy of more than 50\%. In
   addition, ONO-2952, at 1 mg/kg or higher, suppressed conditioned fear
   stress-induced freezing behavior in rats with an efficacy equivalent to
   that of diazepam, given orally at 3 mg/kg. Results of the passive
   avoidance learning test revealed that ONO-2952, unlike diazepam, did not
   affect learning and memory even at doses 10 times higher than its
   effective doses in the stress models. The present findings indicate that
   ONO-2952 is a promising candidate for the treatment of stress-related
   disorders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two proteins of the GRETCHEN HAGEN3 (GH3) family of acyl acid amido
   synthetases from the moss Physcomitrella patens conjugate
   indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to a series of amino acids. The possible
   function of altered auxin levels in the moss in response to two
   different growth perturbations, elevated temperatures and darkness, was
   analyzed using a) the recently described double knockout lines in both
   P. patens GH3 genes (GH3-doKO) and b) a previously characterized line
   harboring an auxin-inducible soybean GH3 promoter::reporter fused to
   beta-glucuronidase (G1-GUS). The GUS activity as marker of the auxin
   response increased at higher temperatures and after cultivation in the
   darkness for a period of up to four weeks. Generally, the double
   knockout plants grew more slowly than the wild type (WT). The altered
   growth conditions influenced the phenotypes of the double knockout lines
   differently from that of WT moss. Higher temperatures negatively
   affected GH3-doKO plants compared to WT which was shown by stronger loss
   of chlorophyll. On the other hand, a positive effect was found on the
   concentrations of free IAA which increased at 28 degrees C in the
   GH3-doKO lines compared to WT plants. A different factor, namely
   darkness vs. a light/dark cycle caused the adverse phenotype concerning
   chlorophyll concentrations. Mutant moss plants showed higher chlorophyll
   concentrations than WT and these correlated with higher free IAA in the
   plant population that was classified as green. Our data show that growth
   perturbations result in higher free IAA levels in the GH3-doKO mutants,
   but in one case growth in darkness the mutants could cope better with
   the condition, whereas at elevated temperatures the mutants were more
   sensitive than WT. Thus, GH3 function in P. patens WT could lie in the
   regulation of IAA concentrations under unfavorable environmental
   conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Treatment sequencing in older patients is difficult because
   of concomitant comorbidities and often decreasing performance status.
   The present study sought to examine the effect of neoadjuvant therapy
   and pancreatic surgery in older patients with resectable or
   borderline-resectable (BLR pancreatic cancer (PC).
   Methods. Patients with resectable or BLR PC treated with neoadjuvant
   therapy were classified as older (>= 75 years) or younger (<75 years).
   Results. Neoadjuvant therapy was initiated in 246 patients; 210 (85\%)
   younger than 75 years and 36 (15\%) older Older patients had a greater
   median Charlson comorbidity index (CCI): 6 vs 4 (P < .01). Completion of
   all intended therapy (neoadjuvant therapy and surgery) occurred in 177
   (72\%) of the 246 patients; 153 (73\%) of the 210 younger and 24 (67\%)
   of the 36 older patients (P = .43). Failure to complete all therapy was
   associated with BLR clinical stage (odds ratio {[}OR] 0.26, P = .001),
   increased posttreatment/preoperative serum levels of CA19-9 (OR 0.27,
   95\% confidence interval 0.14-0.53), and CCI >= 6 (OR 0.44, 95\%
   confidence interval 0.22-0.86). Median overall survival for all study
   patients was 26.1 and 19.7 months (P = .13) for younger and older
   patients, respectively. Of the 177 patients who completed all therapy,
   the difference in survival between younger and older patients was not
   statistically significant (36.5 months vs 27.2 months, P = .47).
   Conclusion. Failure to complete neoadjuvant therapy and eventual
   pancreatic resection is associated with BLR stage, increased
   posttreatment/preoperative CA19-9, and CCI >= 6, but not older age.
   Older patients who completed neoadjuvant therapy and underwent resection
   experienced a survival benefit compared with those who did not complete
   all intended therapy. Balancing the toxicity of sequential therapies
   with their cumulative effect on tolerance and risk for pancreatic
   surgery will be the key to developing optimal treatment sequencing in
   older patients with PC.}},

   To evaluate BC and BMD in ENG-releasing implant users as compared to
   copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD)-users.
   A prospective study was conducted on 75 users of both contraceptive
   methods. BMD was evaluated at femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS)
   (L1-L4) and BC at baseline and at 12 months after insertion.
   The mean (+/- SD) age was 30.4 +/- A 6.8 and 29.8 +/- A 8.4 years and
   body mass index (kg/m(2)) was 24.9 +/- A 4.1 and 24.6 +/- A 3.5 in
   ENG-releasing implant- and Cu-IUD-users, respectively. ENG-releasing
   implant users did not show significant differences on BMD at the LS and
   FN at 12 months of use. Furthermore, ENG-implant users had an increase
   in body weight at 12 months (p < 0.001) and an increase of 2 \% in the
   percentage of body fat, when compared with Cu-IUD users. There was a
   significant increase in lean mass in ENG-implant users at 12 months (p =
   0.020).
   No significant changes of BMD were seen after the first year of use
   among the ENG-releasing implant-users, albeit an increase of weight and
   fat mass was seen when compared to Cu-IUD users.}},

Abstract = {{Damages by wind and by European spruce bark beetle (I. typographus L.)
   were compared on the basis of the reports about the occurrence of
   harmful forest agents for the period 1964-1991 across former regional
   state forest directorates. In the given period, the quantity of salvage
   logging (70 million m(3)) was more than five times that of sanitation
   felling (13 million m(3)). Damage intensity increased over the decades.
   Using a cross-correlation function between the time series, an increase
   in the abundance of I. typographus due to windfall was demonstrated with
   a delay of 1-3 years. Wind damage was also shown to arise as a result of
   disturbed stand stability after sanitation felling with a stochastic
   delay of 1-5 years. Thus, disturbance of static stability of forest
   stands may be considered as one of the main harmful consequences of bark
   beetle outbreaks for the near future. Consequences for forest management
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the relationship between the interictal high-frequency
   oscillations (HFOs) and the seizure onset zones (SOZs) defined by the
   ictal HFOs or conventional frequency activity (CFA), and evaluated the
   usefulness of the interictal HFOs as spatial markers of the SOZs. We
   analysed seizures showing discrete HFOs at onset on intracranial EEGs
   acquired at 1000-Hz sampling rate in a training cohort of 10 patients
   with temporal and extratemporal epilepsy. We classified each ictal
   channel as: HFO+ (HFOs at onset with subsequent evolution), HFO- (HFOs
   at onset without evolution), CFA (1.6-70-Hz activity at onset with
   evolution), or non-ictal. We defined the SOZs as: hSOZ (HFO+ channels
   only), hfo+\&-SOZ (HFO+ and HFO- channels), and cSOZ (CFA channels).
   Using automated methods, we detected the interictal HFOs and extracted
   five features: density, connectivity, peak frequency, log power, and
   amplitude. We created logistic regression models using these features,
   and tested their performance in a separate replication cohort of three
   patients. The models containing the five interictal HFO features
   reliably differentiated the channels located inside the SOZ from those
   outside in the training cohort (p<0.001), reaching the highest accuracy
   for the classification of hSOZ. Log power and connectivity had the
   highest odds ratios, both being higher for the channels inside the SOZ
   compared with those outside the SOZ. In the replication cohort of novel
   patients, the same models differentiated the HFO+ from HFO- channels,
   and predicted the extents of the hSOZ and hfo+\&-SOZ (F1 measure >0.5)
   but not the cSOZ. Our study shows that the interictal HFOs are useful in
   defining the spatial extent of the SOZ, and predicting whether or not a
   given channel in a novel patient would be involved in the seizure. The
   findings support the existence of an abnormal network of tightly-linked
   ictal and interictal HFOs in patients with intractable epilepsy.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of prenatal
   diagnosis (PND) for the prevention of thalassemia in Southern Iran.
   Methods From 2004 to 2012 1346 couples with beta-thalassemia minor were
   referred to our center. Mutation analyses utilized different methods
   including polymerase chain reaction-based technique of amplification
   refractory mutation system (ARMS), Restriction Fragment Length
   Polymorphism Analysis of PCR-Amplified Fragments (PCR-RFLP) and Gel
   Electrophoresis and direct sequencing. Haplotype analysis of the
   beta-globin gene cluster was done routinely using the PCR-RFLP
   technique.
   Results Of the 1346 couples, 884 (66\%) requested PND. They had a total
   of 985 pregnancies (954 singleton and 31 twin pregnancies): the 1016
   fetuses underwent chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Thalassemia major was
   diagnosed in 266 cases (26.2\%), and termination of pregnancy was
   requested by the parents in 264 of them (99\%). Thalassemia trait was
   detected in 499 (49.1\%) and 251 cases (24.7\%) showed no
   beta-thalassemia mutations. There were three misdiagnoses (0.4\%)
   (affected children diagnosed as carriers at PND). A unique pattern of
   thalassemia mutations was present in the study population, with IVS II-I
   (G -> A), C36-37(-T), IVS I-5(G>C), -25bpdel (252-276), IVS I-110 (G>A)
   and C44 (-C) being present in 62\% of cases.

   spirometric measurements. Our results indicated that pulmonary function
   tests were significantly reduced after LVAD placement (forced expiratory
   volume in one second {[}FEV1]: 1.9 vs.1.7, P=0.016; forced vital
   capacity {[}FVC]: 2.61 vs. 2.38, P=0.03; diffusing capacity of the lungs
   for carbon monoxide {[}DLCO]: 14.75 vs. 11.01, P=0.01). Subgroup
   analysis revealed greater impairment in lung function in patients
   receiving HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA) LVADs compared
   with those receiving HeartWare (HeartWare, Framingham, MA, USA) devices.
   These unexpected findings may result from restriction of left anterior
   hemi-diaphragm; however, further prospective studies to validate our
   findings are warranted.}},

Title = {{Interfacing the geographic information system, remote sensing, and the
   soil conservation service-curve number method to estimate curve number
   and runoff volume in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia}},
Journal = {{ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{11093-11105}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Runoff coefficients are widely used as a diagnostic variable of runoff
   generation in process studies and as an important input parameter in
   hydrologic design. Many regions of Saudi Arabia do not have sufficient
   historical records and the detailed runoff information needed for
   physically based distribution models. The US Department of Agriculture,
   Natural Resources Conservation Service Curve Number (USDA-NRCS-CN)
   method was used in this study for determining the curve number and
   runoff depth for Asir region, Saudi Arabia. Runoff curve number was
   determined based on the factors of hydrologic soil group, land use and
   land cover, and slope gradient in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia using
   the geographic information system (GIS). The region was not subjected
   before for any previous studies concerning runoff generation or
   rainwater harvesting by using GIS and remote sensing. ArcGIS 9.3 and the
   global positioning system were used to develop the soil map on the basis
   of samples collected during a field survey. Soil textures were
   identified and used to build a map of the hydrological soil groups.
   Unsupervised and supervised classification of Landsat images was used to
   generate land use and land cover maps. The land cover distribution in
   the study area revealed that the largest class in the area, barren and
   sparsely vegetated land, occupied 62,832.38 km(2) of the study area
   (more than 80 \% of the total area), followed by shrubland (15,212.66
   km(2)), cropland and pasture (52.34 km(2)), mixed shrubland/grassland
   (40.89 km(2)), and grassland (12.27 km(2)). Built-up land occupied only
   11.45 km(2). The slope map for the Asir region was generated from a 15-m
   digital elevation model. The GIS technique was used to develop the CN
   for the region based on the Soil Conservation Service method. The annual
   runoff depth was derived from the annual rainfall and CN per pixel using
   the raster calculator tool in ArcGIS. The rainfall distribution in the
   study area showed the wise identification of suitable sites for
   rainwater harvesting, as most of the constructed dams were located in
   the areas with higher rainfall. The analysis also revealed that the
   annual runoff for the study area ranged from 27 to 69 \% of the total
   rainfall, with variation as low as 80 to 300 mm/year. This is the
   highest amount of runoff that can be generated in Saudi Arabia. The
   runoff volume was calculated for the entire region using the previously
   developed runoff depth map and basin areas. The results showed that the
   runoff volume (M3) in the Asir region varied from as low as 237,000 m(3)
   to a maximum of 2,140,000 m(3); this result revealed a significant
   yearly amount of runoff that can be harvested for any use. Moreover, the
   calculated runoff depth in the area agreed with the actual dam
   capacities for the existing dams in the Asir region. This approach can
   be applied in other regions in Saudi Arabia for rainwater harvesting and
   groundwater recharge.}},

Title = {{A modified equation for the downstream dilution of stream sediment
   anomalies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{185-193}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Mixing stream sediments originating from mineralization surface with
   eroded materials from background areas leads to downstream dilution in
   metal content of mineralization-sourced sediments. This phenomenon has a
   negative effect on delineation of anomalous catchment basins. In order
   to eliminate the dilution effect from the chemical analysis of stream
   sediments data, Hawkes (1976) proposed the equation ``C(m)A(m) =
   A(a)(C-a - (b)) C(b)A(m){''} through which he calculated the metal
   concentration at the mineralization surface. Hawkes's equation was a
   great advancement in interpretation of stream sediment geochemical
   datasets.
   However, Hawkes makes some simplifying assumptions to derive his formula
   from the mass balance equation including the hypothesis that the total
   sediment produced at a basin surface is delivered to the basin outlet.
   By this approach, an equation is obtained in which a linear relation is
   set between the sediment delivery and the area size of the basin. Some
   of the Hawkes's assumptions are inevitable, but the aforementioned one
   is not in general true. In the present research, a new equation is
   derived by employing the concept of sediment delivery ratio (SDR) and
   its introduction into the mass balance equation, used by Hawkes (1976).
   SDR that represents the gap between the gross erosion in a catchment
   basin and the amount of sediment delivered at the basin outlet is
   negatively related to the basin size, and, as the basin size increases,
   the rate of deposition at the basin outlet decreases.
   SDR plays the main role in our work to attain a modified formula in
   which the dilution is related to the basin size by a power function. The
   modified equation ``C(m)A(m)(1+n) = C(a)A(a)(1 + n) - C-b(A(a) -
   A(m))(1+n){''} is a general form of Hawkes's equation where power equals
   1 (n = 0) corresponds to Hawkes's equation. The new equation was applied
   to test the data presented by Hawkes, and it emerged that, in his study,
   n = 0 delivers closer results to the reality in the first case study,
   but n = -0.25 and -0.5 delivers closer Cu values to the actual value in
   the second case. Similarly, more acceptable results were achieved for Mo
   if n = 0.25 in the second case. Additionally, the sample catchment basin
   was tested on the stream sediment dataset in the west of Iran, where
   orogenic gold occurrences were recognized to exist. Employing the
   modified equation with those three n values has resulted in
   repositioning of some catchment basins in terms of their favorability.

Abstract = {{It is of common use in modern Venn diagrams to mark a compartment with a
   cross to express its non-emptiness. Modern scholars seem to derive this
   convention from Charles S. Peirce, with the assumption that it was
   unknown to John Venn. This paper demonstrates that Venn actually
   introduced several methods to represent existentials but felt uneasy
   with them. The resistance to formalize existentials was not limited to
   diagrammatic systems, as George Boole and his followers also failed to
   provide a satisfactory symbolic representation for them. This difficulty
   points out issues that are inherent to the very nature of existentials.
   This paper assesses the various methods designed for the representation
   of existential statements with Venn diagrams. First, Venn's own attempts
   are discussed and compared with other solutions proposed by his
   contemporaries and successors, notably Lewis Carroll and Peirce. Since
   disjunctives hold an important role in an effective representation of
   existentials, their representation is also discussed. Finally, recent
   methods for the diagrammatic representation of existing individuals,
   rather than mere existence, are surveyed.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundMost studies on offending heterogeneity have been conducted
   with general population samples. It is not clear to what extent these
   can inform such outcomes for individuals with substance use disorders
   specifically.
   AimsThe aim of this study is to compare the offending trajectories of
   individuals treated for substance use disorders in adolescence with a
   matched general population sample, and to test for gender differences in
   this respect.
   MethodGrowth mixture models were applied to identify offending
   trajectories from age 15 to 33 of 1568 individuals treated for substance
   use disorders in adolescence, and in a matched population-based sample
   of 1500 individuals.
   ResultsSeveral parallel trajectories for men and for women were
   identified in both samples. The substance misuse treatment sample,
   however, had higher levels of offending, larger offender classes, longer
   careers and two additional, distinct trajectories. Although there were
   similarities between the men and women, the men were more heterogeneous
   offenders. There were two distinct offending trajectories among male
   substance misusersdecreasing high level and decreasing low level
   offending.
   ConclusionsDifferences between substance using and general population
   samples indicate that results from the latter could underestimate the
   severity, heterogeneity, and persistence of offending trajectories if
   merely generalised to individuals with substance use disorders. Our
   results also indicated that population-based samples might be
   underpowered for detecting female offending heterogeneity. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Modern cities face a large number of issues related to boundary, land
   alteration and environmental degradation. Extensive urban expansion is
   an especially serious problem faced by most of the cities in developing
   countries. Urban management has extensive engagement with rapid urban
   expansion and their factors to achieve a sustainable form of
   development. A more inclusive understanding of the urban driver
   variables and their cross comparison greatly helps to investigate this
   rapid urban expansion. The major theme of this study will be to inquire
   into this factors of urban expansion. Both global and local regressions
   are performed to determine the spatial variability of the driving forces
   of urban expansion. The results indicate that geographically weighted
   regression model outperformed global regression. Urban expansion in the
   city of Kolkata can be observed mainly in two directions; northeast and
   south-east. The possible reasons include that of economic appraising,
   lack of environmental distress and good spatial settings along with
   investor interest, which together determine the biased bidirectional
   axial expansion. This study comes to the conclusion that local variables
   are significant in driving the bi-directional urban expansion in the

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{130-138}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Finding an optimal alignment connecting two end-points in a specified
   corridor is a complex problem that requires solving,three interrelated
   sub-problems, namely the horizontal alignment, vertical alignment and
   earthwork optimization problems. In this research, we developed a novel
   bi-level optimization model combining those three problems. In the outer
   level of the model, we optimize the horizontal alignment and in the
   inner level of the model a vertical alignment optimization problem
   considering earthwork allocation is solved for a fixed horizontal
   alignment. Derivative-free optimization algorithms are used to solve the
   outer problem. The result of our model gives an optimal horizontal
   alignment in the form of a linear-circular curve and an optimal vertical
   alignment in the form of a quadratic spline. Our model is tested on
   real-life data. The numerical results show that our approach improves
   the road alignment designed by civil engineers by 27\% on average,
   resulting in potentially millions of dollars of savings. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Parasitic helminth worms, such as Schistosoma mansoni, are endemic in
   regions with a high prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) among the
   population. Human studies suggest that helminth coinfections contribute
   to increased TB susceptibility and increased rates of TB reactivation.
   Prevailing models suggest that T helper type 2 (Th2) responses induced
   by helminth infection impair Th1 immune responses and thereby limit
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) control. Using a pulmonary mouse model
   of Mtb infection, we demonstrated that S. mansoni coinfection or
   immunization with S. mansoni egg antigens can reversibly impair
   Mtb-specific T cell responses without affecting macrophage-mediated Mtb
   control. Instead, S. mansoni infection resulted in accumulation of high
   arginase-1-expressing macrophages in the lung, which formed type 2
   granulomas and exacerbated inflammation in Mtb-infected mice. Treatment
   of coinfected animals with an antihelminthic improved Mtb-specific Th1
   responses and reduced disease severity. In a genetically diverse mouse
   population infected with Mtb, enhanced arginase-1 activity was
   associated with increased lung inflammation. Moreover, in patients with
   pulmonary TB, lung damage correlated with increased serum activity of
   arginase-1, which was elevated in TB patients coinfected with helminths.
   Together, our data indicate that helminth coinfection induces
   arginase-1-expressing type 2 granulomas, thereby increasing inflammation
   and TB disease severity. These results also provide insight into the
   mechanisms by which helminth coinfections drive increased
   susceptibility, disease progression, and severity in TB.}},

Journal = {{MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{According to the current AJCC staging system, the T stage of distal
   extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma (EBD) is classified according to the
   extent of the tumor within or beyond the bile duct wall. However many
   invasive carcinoma accompany stromal desmoplasia that obscure lower
   boundary of bile duct wall; it is frequently difficult to clearly define
   the extent of tumors using the current T classification system. In this
   study, we validated an alternative T classification system by depth of
   invasion (DoI; T1:<5 mm, T2: 5 to 12 mm, and T3: >= 12 mm).
   Specifically, we evaluated DoI in 114 cases of distal EBD carcinoma
   using digital scan images to achieve more objective measurements of
   tumor DoI. In addition, we evaluated the effect of the number of
   metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) as well as the number of total examined LNs
   on the survival rate in the same patient group, and performed a
   comparative analysis of these data to assess patient survival. We also
   analyzed 114 cases of distal EBD carcinoma using the current T and N
   classification of the AJCC staging system (7th edition). The T stage of
   the current AJCC staging system was not associated with significant
   differences in patient survival, especially between T2 and T3. However,
   T staging by DoI was associated with statistically significant
   differences in patient survival (P < 0.001 in DoI-1, P = 0.002 in
   DoI-2). With respect to N stage, we divided patients into 3 tiers
   comprising class 1 (no nodal metastasis), class 2 (1-3 nodal
   metastases), and class 3 (4 or more nodal metastases). In 3-tier
   classification analysis, the median survival times for classes 1, 2, and
   3 were 79.2, 28.8, and 10.9 months, respectively. The difference in
   survival among the 3 classes was statistically significant (P < 0.001).
   We found the cut-off value of 11 LNs (1 to 10 vs >= 11) for N0 stage
   showed most significant difference (P = 0.007). We think at least 11 LNs
   should be examined for more accurate evaluation of N stage in distal EBD
   carcinoma. We propose an alternative T classification using DoI and
   3-tier sub-classification of N stage for distal EBD carcinoma.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a multi-focus image fusion algorithm based on the
   nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) and the nonsubsampled shearlet
   transform (NSST) is proposed. The source images are first decomposed by
   the NSCT and NSST into low frequency coefficients and high frequency
   coefficients. Then, the average method is used to fuse low frequency
   coefficient of the NSCT. To obtain more accurate salience measurement,
   the high frequency coefficients of the NSST and NSCT are combined to
   measure salience. The high frequency coefficients of the NSCT with
   larger salience are selected as fused high frequency coefficients.
   Finally, the fused image is reconstructed by the inverse NSCT. We adopt
   three metrics (Q(AB/F), Q(e) and Q(w)) to evaluate the quality of fused
   images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
   outperforms other methods. It retains highly detailed edges and

Abstract = {{We study systems (V, T, U-1, U-2) consisting of a finite dimensional
   vector space V, a nilpotent k-linear operator T : V -> V and two
   T-invariant subspaces U-1 subset of U-2 subset of V. Let S(n) be the
   category of such systems where the operator T acts with nilpotency index
   at most n. We determine the dimension types (dim U-1, dim U-2/U-1, dim
   V/U-2) of indecomposable systems in S(n) for n <= 4. It turns out that
   in the case where n = 4 there are infinitely many such triples (x, y,
   z), they all lie in the cylinder given by vertical bar x - y vertical
   bar, vertical bar y - z vertical bar, vertical bar z - x vertical bar <=
   4. But not each dimension type in the cylinder can be realized by an
   indecomposable system. In particular, there are holes in the cylinder.
   Namely, no triple in (x, y, z) is an element of (3, 1, 3) + N(2, 2, 2)
   can be realized, while each neighbor (x +/- 1, y, z), (x, y +/- 1, z),
   (x, y, z +/- 1) can. Compare this with Bongartz' No-Gap Theorem, which
   states that for an associative algebra A over an algebraically closed
   field, there is no gap in the lengths of the indecomposable A-modules of

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND We developed a hemorrhagic shock animal model to replicate an
   urban prehospital setting where resuscitation fluids are limited to
   assess the effect of saline versus plasma in coagulopathic patients. An
   in vitro model of whole blood dilution with saline exacerbated tissue
   plasminogen activator (tPA)-mediated fibrinolysis, while plasma dilution
   did not change fibrinolysis. We hypothesize that shock-induced
   hyperfibrinolysis can be attenuated by resuscitation with plasma while
   exacerbated by saline.
   METHODS Sprague-Dawley rats were hemorrhaged to a mean arterial pressure
   of 25 mm Hg and maintained in shock for 30 minutes. Animals were
   resuscitated with either normal saline (NS) or platelet-free plasma
   (PFP) with a 10\% total blood volume bolus, followed by an additional 5
   minutes of resuscitation with NS to increase blood pressure to a mean
   arterial pressure of 30 mm Hg. Animals were observed for 15 minutes for
   the assessment of hemodynamic response and survival. Blood samples were
   analyzed with thrombelastography paired with protein analysis.
   RESULTS The median percentage of total blood volume shed per group were
   similar (NS, 52.5\% vs. PFP, 55.7; p = 0.065). Survival was 50\% in NS
   compared with 100\% in PFP. The change in LY30 and tPA levels from
   baseline to shock was similar between groups (LY30 PFP, 10;
   interquartile range {[}IQR], 4.3-11.2; NS, 4.5; IQR, 4.1-14.2; p = 1.00;
   tPA PFP, 16.6 ng/mL; IQR, 13.7-27.8; NS, 22.4; IQR, 20.1-25.5; p =
   0.240). After resuscitation, the median change in LY30 was greater in
   the NS group (13.5; IQR, 3.5-19.9) compared with PFP (-4.9\%; IQR, -9.22
   to 0.25 p = 0.004), but tPA levels did not significantly change (NS,
   1.4; IQR, -6.2 to 7.1 vs. PFP, 1.7; IQR, -5.2 to 6.8; p = 0.699).
   CONCLUSION Systemic hyperfibrinolysis is driven by hypoperfusion and
   associated with increased levels of tPA. Plasma is a superior
   resuscitation fluid to NS in a prehospital model of severe hemorrhagic
   shock as it attenuates hyperfibrinolysis and improves systemic

Abstract = {{Behavioral studies performed in natural habitats provide a context for
   the development of hypotheses and the design of experiments relevant
   both to biomechanics and to evolution. In particular, predator-prey
   interactions are a model system for integrative study because success or
   failure of predation has a direct effect on fitness and drives the
   evolution of specialized performance in both predator and prey. Although
   all predators share the goal of capturing prey, and all prey share the
   goal of survival, the behavior of predators and prey are diverse in
   nature. This article presents studies of some predator-prey interactions
   sharing common predation strategies that reveal general principles
   governing the behaviors of predator and prey, even in distantly related
   taxa. Studies of predator-prey interactions also reveal that maximal
   performance observed in a laboratory setting is not necessarily the
   performance that determines fitness. Thus, considering locomotion in the
   context of predation ecology can aid in evolutionarily relevant
   experimental design. Classification by strategy reveals that displaying
   unpredictable trajectories is a relevant anti-predator behavior in
   response to multiple predation strategies. A predator's perception and
   pursuit of prey can be affected indirectly by divergent locomotion of
   similar animals that share an ecosystem. Variation in speed and
   direction of locomotion that directly increases the unpredictability of
   a prey's trajectory can be increased through genetic mutation that
   affects locomotor patterns, musculoskeletal changes that affect
   maneuverability, and physical interactions between an animal and the
   environment. By considering the interconnectedness of ecology, physical
   constraints, and the evolutionary history of behavior, studies in
   biomechanics can be designed to inform each of these fields.}},

Journal = {{EATING BEHAVIORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Pages = {{33-38}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The goal of the present study was to examine dietary adherence and
   acceptability among participants from the New DIETs study who were
   randomized to one of four plant-based diets (vegan, vegetarian,
   pesco-vegetarian, semi-vegetarian) or an omnivore diet. Primary outcomes
   at two-and six months included dietary adherence (24-hour dietary
   recalls), weight loss and changes in animal product intake (mg
   cholesterol) by adherence status, Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire
   (TFEQ), Power of Food Scale (PFS), dietary acceptability (Food
   Acceptability Questionnaire), and impact of diet preference on
   adherence. No differences were found in dietary adherence or changes in
   FAQ, TFEQ, or PFS among the groups. At six months, non-adherent vegan
   and vegetarian participants (n = 16) had a significantly greater
   decrease in cholesterol intake (- 190.2 +/- 199.2 mg) than non-adherent
   pesco-vegetarian/semi-vegetarian (n = 15, - 2.3 +/- 200.3 mg, P = 0.02)
   or omnivore participants (n = 7, 17.0 +/- 36.0, P = 0.04). Non-adherent
   vegan/vegetarian participants lost significantly more weight at
   sixmonths (- 6.0 +/- 6.7\%) than non-adherent omnivore participants (-
   0.4 +/- 0.6\%, P = 0.04). Dietary preference had no impact on adherence
   at six months. Due to equal rates of adherence and acceptability among
   the diet groups, instructing participants to follow vegan or vegetarian
   diets may have a greater impact on weight loss and animal product intake
   than providing instruction in more moderate approaches even among
   non-adherent participants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports insights from a 4-day Gathering of Native American
   Healers at the University of Michigan in October of 2010. This event
   convened 18 traditional healers, clinically trained service providers,
   and cross-cultural mental health researchers for a structured group
   dialogue to advance professional knowledge about the integration of
   Indigenous healing practices and conventional mental health treatments
   in community-based mental health services for Native Americans. Our
   thematic analysis of transcripts from five Roundtable sessions afforded
   several key insights and understandings pertaining to the integration of
   Indigenous healing and conventional mental health services. First, with
   reference to traditional healing, the importance of a rampant
   relationality, various personal qualities, Indigenous spirituality, and
   maintenance of traditional life and culture were accentuated by
   Roundtable participants. Second, for traditional healers to practice
   effectively, Roundtable participants posited that these individuals must
   maintain personal wellness, cultivate profound knowledge of healing
   practices, recognize the intrinsic healing potential within all human
   beings, and work for the community rather than themselves. In speaking
   to the possibilities and challenges of collaboration between Indigenous
   and conventional biomedical therapeutic approaches, Roundtable
   participants recommended the implementation of cultural programming, the
   observance of mutuality and respect, the importance of clear and honest
   communication, and the need for awareness of cultural differences as
   unique challenges that must be collaboratively overcome.}},

Title = {{Time-course analysis of C3a and C5a quantifies the coupling between the
   upper and terminal Complement pathways in vitro}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGICAL METHODS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{427}},
Pages = {{13-18}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An in vitro zymosan-activation of the Complement system, through the
   lectin and alternative pathways, was performed in pooled human serum
   over a 24 h time-course. Activation was quantitatively monitored by
   measuring the concentration of the upper Complement pathway fragment,
   C3a and the terminal pathway fragment, C5a. Upper Complement showed a
   maximum activation of 39\% and the time-to-maximum activation reduced
   8-fold, as a highly non-linear function of the zymosan dose. The C3a:C5a
   molar ratio rose to a maximum of 1100:1, before terminal pathway
   activation was initiated; indicating a flux threshold. This threshold
   appears to be exceeded once more than 31\% of 0 molecules are activated.
   Above this threshold, significant activation of terminal pathway was
   observed; reducing the molar ratio to 17:1. The C5a/C3a molar ratio was
   used to determine the terminal pathway activation relative to total
   Complement activation and ranged from 0.1-0.8\%. This depicts upper
   Complement activation to be 49-fold larger than terminal activation, a
   figure consistent with the observed density of the membrane attack
   complex in the membrane of cells. Our results thus indicate that the
   relative activity of opsonisation is similar to 50-fold greater than
   membrane attack complex formation, in vitro, in the pooled serum
   phenotype. The results suggest a potential clinical application, where
   an in vitro analysis of a patient on admission, or prior to a surgical
   procedure, would indicate their upper Complement activation capacity,
   with activation of C3 measured thereafter, or post-operatively. A
   patient with an exhausted upper Complement capacity may be vulnerable to
   infections and complications, such as sepsis. (C) 2015 Published by

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1163-1179}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with the linear entropic relationship between the
   maximum velocity, u(max), and the mean flow velocity, u(m), through a
   dimensionless parameter Phi(M), in open-channel flow. The analysis is
   conducted with the aid of experimental data collected in straight
   laboratory flumes under different bed and side-walls roughness
   conditions. In particular, rough/vegetated beds and smooth/rough
   side-walls conditions have been investigated. The results show that, in
   the investigated conditions (with exception of low-submergence vegetated
   bed-h/k(v) < 2), Phi(M) can be assumed equal to a value that is very
   close to that found in natural channels. This demonstrates that Phi(M)
   is able to implicitly reflect the different hydraulic behavior which is
   determined in rough and submerged vegetated beds. Thus, the
   entropy-based Manning's roughness formula has been validated and the
   sensitivity analysis of Manning's coefficient with the values of y(o)
   (location of the zero-velocity plane) has been also performed. It is
   found that this formula is quite robust to represent the observed flow
   resistance also in the presence of vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method to ``coarsely{''} describe extremely
   high-resolution (EHR) images acquired by means of unmanned aerial
   vehicles (UAVs) over urban areas. Standard image analysis approaches
   cannot be directly exploited for the automatic description of UAV images
   due to their EHR. For this reason, we propose an alternative approach
   that consists first in the subdivision of the original UAV image in a
   grid of tiles. Then, each tile is compared with a library of training
   tiles to inherit the binary multilabel vector of the most similar
   training tile. This vector conveys a list of classes likely present in
   the considered tile. Our multiclass tile-based approach needs the
   definition of two main ingredients: 1) a suitable tile-representation
   strategy; and 2) a tile-to-tile matching operation. Various
   tile-representation and matching strategies are investigated. In
   particular, we present three global representation strategies, which
   process each tile as a whole and two point-based strategies that exploit
   points of interest within the considered tile. Regarding the matching
   strategies, two simple measures of distance, namely, the Euclidean and
   the chi-squared histogram distances, are explored. Interesting
   experimental results conducted on a rich set of real UAV images acquired
   over an urban area are reported and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Ovarian endometriosis is a recognized risk for infertility and
   epithelial ovarian cancer, presumably due to iron overload resulting
   from repeated hemorrhage. To find a clue for early detection and
   prevention of ovarian endometriosis-associated cancer, it is mandatory
   to evaluate catalytic (labile) ferrous iron (catalytic Fe(II)) and to
   study iron manipulation in ovarian endometriotic lesions. By the use of
   tissues from women of ovarian endometriosis as well as endometrial
   tissue from women with and without endometriosis, we for the first time
   performed histological analysis and cellular detection of catalytic
   Fe(II) with a specific fluorescent probe (HMRhoNox-M), and further
   evaluated iron transport proteins in the human specimens and in
   co-culture experiments using immortalized human eutopic/ectopic
   endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) in the presence or absence of
   epithelial cells (EpCs). The amounts of catalytic Fe(II) were higher in
   ectopic endometrial stromal cells (ecESCs) than in normal eutopic
   endometrial stromal cells (n-euESCs) both in the tissues and in the
   corresponding immortalized ESCs. ecESCs exhibited higher transferrin
   receptor 1 expression both in vivo and in vitro and lower ferroportin
   expression in vivo than n-euESCs, leading to sustained iron uptake. In
   co-culture experiments of ESCs with iron-loaded EpCs, ecESCs received
   catalytic ferrous iron from EpCs, but n-euESCs did not. These data
   suggest that ecESC play a protective role for cancer-target epithelial
   cells by collecting excess iron, and that these characteristics are
   retained in the immortalized ecESCs. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL GENETICS SUPPLEMENT SERIES}},

Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{E126-E127}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In forensic genetics, increasing the number of short tandem repeat (STR)
   loci is an efficient strategy to achieve a high likelihood ratio (LR)
   for sibship determination. However, as the number of loci increases, the
   effect of linkage among the loci may become more pronounced. Hence, we
   evaluated the effect of linkage on sibship determination when analyzing
   multiple loci including linked loci. We investigated LR value variation
   in two linked loci by changing the recombination rate and allele
   frequencies. We then compared LR values with values calculated without
   considering linkage, using computationally generated genotypes of
   sibling pairs. These results suggested that the effect of linkage on LR
   values in sibship determination is affected by the identity by state of
   the loci, allele frequencies, and number of loci. Therefore, linkage
   must be considered to calculate rigorous LR values. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Volume = {{46}},

Pages = {{666-673}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We previously reported the first `reverse antibiotic' (RA), nybomycin
   (NYB), which showed a unique antimicrobial activity against
   Staphylococcus aureus strains. NYB specifically suppressed the growth of
   quinolone-resistant S. aureus strains but was not effective against
   quinolone-susceptible strains. Although NYB was first reported in 1955,
   little was known about its unique antimicrobial activity because it was
   before the synthesis of the first quinolone ('old quinolone'), nalidixic
   acid, in 1962. Following our re-discovery of NYB, we looked for other
   RAs among natural substances that act on quinolone-resistant bacteria.
   Commercially available flavones were screened against S. aureus,
   including quinolone-resistant strains, and their minimum inhibitory
   concentrations (MICs) were compared using the microbroth dilution
   method. Some of the flavones screened showed stronger antimicrobial
   activity against quinolone-resistant strains than against
   quinolone-susceptible ones. Amongst them, apigenin (API) was the most
   potent in its RA activity. DNA cleavage assay showed that API inhibited
   DNA gyrase harbouring the quinolone resistance mutation gyrA(Ser84Leu)
   but did not inhibit `wild-type' DNA gyrase that is sensitive to
   levofloxacin. An API-susceptible S. aureus strain Mu50 was also selected
   using agar plates containing 20 mg/L API. Whole-genome sequencing of
   selected mutant strains was performed and frequent back-mutations
   (reverse mutations) were found among API-resistant strains derived from
   the API-susceptible S. aureus strains. Here we report that API
   represents another molecular class of natural antibiotic having RA
   activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Charities that recruit famous humanitarians, or obtain celebrity
   endorsements, may promote products associated with these altruistic
   superstars in an effort to increase donations. Previous research
   supports that ``superstar{''} role models can promote desirable
   behavior. Charitable organizations may assume if people handle a product
   associated with a famous humanitarian, they will be inspired and more
   motivated to donate as a result. An opposite possibility is that
   physically handling reminders of an extreme altruist may result in
   contrast effects. Such positive exemplars may result in more negative
   perceptions of one's own charitable behavior, and decrease the perceived
   efficacy of one's own contributions. In two studies, participants did or
   did not touch items said to have belonged to a very altruistic person
   (Experiment 1) or to Mother Teresa (Experiment 2). Compared to
   participants in non-touch and other control conditions, those who
   physically touched items said to belong to an altruist subsequently
   donated fewer raffle tickets to charity. The results are related to
   theories of perceived efficacy, metacognitive processes, and the

Abstract = {{As the development of movement skills are so crucial to a child's
   involvement in lifelong physical activity and sport, the purpose of this
   study was to assess the motor proficiency of children aged 4-7 years
   (range = 4.3-7.2 years), whilst considering gender and socioeconomic
   status. 369 children (176 females, 193 males, aged = 5.96 +/- 0.57
   years) were assessed for fine motor precision, fine motor integration,
   manual dexterity, bilateral co-ordination, balance, speed and agility,
   upper-limb co-ordination and strength. The average standard score for
   all participants was 44.4 +/- 8.9, classifying the participants towards
   the lower end of the average score. Multivariate analysis of covariance
   identified significant effects for gender (p < 0.001) and socioeconomic
   status (p < 0.001). Females outperformed males for fine motor skills and
   boys outperformed girls for catch and dribble gross motor skills. High
   socioeconomic status significantly outperformed middle and/or low
   socioeconomic status for total, fine and gross motor proficiency.
   Current motor proficiency of primary children aged 4-7 years in the UK
   is just below average with differences evident between gender and
   socioeconomic status. Teachers and sport coaches working with primary
   aged children should concentrate on the development of movement skills,
   whilst considering differences between genders and socioeconomic status.

Abstract = {{The acoustic signalling behaviour of many tree cricket species is easily
   observed and has been well described. Very little is known, however,
   about the receivers in these communication loops. The exception to this
   is a single Indian species (Oecanthus henryi) which employs active
   auditory mechanics to enhance female sensitivity to quiet sounds at male
   calling frequencies. In most species, male calls have been described,
   but whether or not sender-receiver matching is present is uncertain.
   Here we investigate auditory mechanics in females of the North American
   black-horned tree cricket (Oecanthus nigricornis). The response of the
   anterior tympanal membrane is nonlinear, exhibiting a lack of tuning at
   high amplitudes (60 dB and above) but as stimulus amplitude decreases,
   the membrane becomes tuned to around 4.3 kHz. The tuning of the membrane
   falls within the frequency range of male calls indicating
   sender-receiver matching at low amplitudes, which could aid localisation
   of the highly directional calls of males. The extent of active auditory
   mechanics in tympanal insects is not yet known, but this paper provides
   an indication that this may indeed be widespread in at least the
   Oecanthinae.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major challenges in the study of language in schizophrenia is
   to identify specific levels of the linguistic structure that might be
   selectively impaired. While historically a main semantic deficit has
   been widely claimed, results are mixed, with also evidence of syntactic
   impairment. This might be due to heterogeneity in materials and
   paradigms across studies, which often do not allow to tap into single
   linguistic components. Moreover, the interaction between linguistic and
   neurocognitive deficits is still unclear. In this study, we concentrated
   on syntactic and semantic knowledge. We employed an anomaly detection
   task including short and long sentences with either syntactic errors
   violating the principles of Universal Grammar, or a novel form of
   semantic errors, resulting from a contradiction in the computation of
   the whole sentence meaning. Fifty-eight patients with diagnosis of
   schizophrenia were compared to 30 healthy subjects. Results showed that,
   in patients, only the ability to identify syntactic anomaly, both in
   short and long sentences, was impaired. This result cannot be explained
   by working memory abilities or psychopathological features. These
   findings suggest the presence of an impairment of syntactic knowledge in
   schizophrenia, at least partially independent of the cognitive and
   psychopathological profile. On the contrary, we cannot conclude that
   there is a semantic impairment, at least in terms of compositional
   semantics abilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Cystic fibrosis: to screen or not to screen? Involving a Citizens' jury

Abstract = {{Context In recent years, the continuous improvements in molecular
   biology techniques have made it possible to detect carriers for several
   genetic conditions, including cystic fibrosis (CF). In some countries,
   CF carrier screening is offered to increasing subset of the general
   population. Offering of carrier screening at a population level should
   not be decided by local health authorities only, without consulting
   citizens' preferences. One way to involve citizens in the decision
   process might be to a Citizens' jury, a method of deliberative
   democracy.
   Objective The object of the study is to produce a recommendation
   statement about CF carrier screening using a Citizens' jury. As this is
   a new method in the field, the study also provided the opportunity to
   evaluate its effectiveness.
   Design The project is designed and managed by an executive committee.
   The whole process is superintended by a multidisciplinary scientific
   committee. The 16 members of the jury attend a 1 day meeting, assisted
   by a non-medical and unbiased facilitator. Informative material was
   prepared and distributed 15 days before the jury meeting; during the
   meeting, experts and witnesses interact directly with all the jurors
   through questions and answers.
   Results All except one member of the jury felt positively about the
   Health Service actively providing population carrier screening for CF.
   The final statement was available to public, clinicians, researchers and
   decision-makers.
   Discussion In general, a Citizens' jury is a feasible method for
   involving citizens in public health decision-making process and in
   particular for obtaining a community view about CF carrier screening.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the findings from a full-scale laboratory experiment
   about the assessment of architectural quality attributes in luminous
   environments. The presented data are part of the findings from a larger

   size and room reflectance on the perceived quality of a small room and
   the correlations between various architectural quality attributes.
   Paired attributes and semantic differential scale were used to assess
   nine attributes. Twenty-six participants evaluated six different
   scenarios: two similar rooms with different surface reflectances
   (created using achromatic colored surfaces: white and black) and three
   different window sizes. Results from the two-way, repeated-measures
   analysis of variance suggested that, separately, window size and room
   reflectance had statistically significant effects on the evaluation of
   the attributes. However, despite the considerable difference in absorbed
   light between the white room and the black room, little support was
   found in the data for the interaction of window size and room
   reflectance together Subsequent analyses of mean ratings suggested that
   window size was more important than the color of the room for positive
   evaluations of certain, attributes. Additionally, the study found very
   strong, positive correlations between the attributes.}},

Abstract = {{High-quality research in clinical psychology often depends on recruiting
   adequate samples of clinical participants with formally diagnosed
   difficulties. This challenge is readily met within the context of a
   large treatment center, but many clinical researchers work in academic
   settings that do not feature a medical school, hospital connections, or
   an in-house clinic. This article describes the model we developed at the
   University of Waterloo Centre for Mental Health Research for identifying
   and recruiting large samples of people from local communities with
   diagnosable mental health problems who are willing to participate in
   research but for whom treatment services are not offered. We compare the
   diagnostic composition, symptom profile, and demographic characteristics
   of our participants with treatment-seeking samples recruited from large
   Canadian and American treatment centers. We conclude that the Anxiety
   Studies Division model represents a viable and valuable method for
   recruiting clinical participants from the community for psychopathology

   velocity profile is stronger, with respect to the temperature profile.
   In addition, with an increase in M, the slip velocity increases on both

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Severe neurological deficit (ND) due to acute aortic
   dissection type A (AADA) was considered a contraindication for surgery
   because of poor prognosis. Recently, more aggressive indication for
   surgery despite neurological symptoms has shown acceptable postoperative
   clinical results. The aim of this study was to evaluate early and
   mid-term outcomes of patients with AADA presenting with acute ND.
   METHODS: Data from 53 patients with new-onset ND who received surgical
   repair for AADA between 2005 and 2012 at our institution were
   retrospectively reviewed. ND was defined as focal motor or sensory
   deficit, hemiplegia, paraplegia, convulsions or coma. Neurological
   symptoms were evaluated preoperatively using the Glasgow Coma Scale
   (GCS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and at discharge as well as 3-6
   months postoperatively using the mRS and National Institutes of Health
   Stroke Scale. Involvement of carotid arteries was assessed in the pre-
   and postoperative computed tomography. Logistic regression analysis was
   performed to detect predictive factors for recovery of ND.
   RESULTS: Of the 53 patients, 29 (54.7\%) showed complete recovery from
   focal ND at follow-up. Neurological symptoms persisted in 24 (45.3\%)
   patients, of which 8 (33\%) died without neurological assessment at
   follow-up. Between the two groups (patients with recovery and those with
   persisting ND), there was no significant difference regarding the
   duration of hypothermic circulatory arrest (28 +/- 14 vs 36 +/- 20 min)
   or severely reduced consciousness (GCS <8). Multivariate analysis showed
   significant differences for the preoperative mRS between the two groups
   (P < 0.007). A high preoperative mRS was associated with persistence of
   neurological symptoms (P < 0.02). Cardiovascular risk factors, age or
   involvement of supra-aortic branches were not predictive for persistence
   of ND.
   CONCLUSION: More than half of our patients recovered completely from ND
   due to AADA after surgery. Severity of clinical symptoms had a
   predictive value. Patients suffering from AADA and presenting with ND
   before surgery should not be excluded from emergency surgery.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of Mn doping on the structural physical, morphological and
   optical properties of Zn1-xMnxO nanoparticles prepared by novel
   co-precipitation route. The samples were characterized using X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-vis
   spectroscopy. Broad peaks observed in XRD patterns indicates that all
   samples were nanocrystalline with hexagonal phase. Studied lattice
   parameters and volume of unit cell as a function of Mn content. The
   crystalline size, lattice strain, stress and strain energy density of Mn
   doped ZnO nanoparticles were determined from XRD patterns using W-H
   three models. The results obtained yields strain, stress and strain
   energy density increases with increasing Mn content and crystalline size
   decrease. Among the developed models, UEDM model was observed to be the
   best fit for co-precipitation route. The transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) result confirms that mean particle size of Zn1-xMnxO
   nanoparticles were about 20-27 nm. The optical study shows the decrease
   in optical energy band gap with Mn doping and confirm that Mn2+ ions
   substituting in ZnO materials. The u parameter and bond length of Mn
   doped ZnO nanoparticles were also investigated in this paper. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This work is motivated by a real-world case study where it is necessary
   to integrate and relate existing ontologies through meta-modelling. For
   this, we introduce the Description Logic SHlQM which is obtained from
   SHlQ by adding statements that equate individuals to concepts in a
   knowledge base. In this new extension, concepts can be individuals of
   another concept (called meta-concept) which itself can be an individual
   of yet another concept (called meta-meta-concept) and so on. We define
   an algorithm that checks consistency of SHlQM by modifying the Tableau
   algorithm for SHlQ. From the practical point of view, this has the
   advantage that we can reuse the code of existing OWL reasoners. From the
   theoretical point of view, it has a similar advantage of reuse. We make
   use of the existing results and proofs that lead to correctness of the
   algorithm for SHIQ in order to prove correctness of the algorithm for
   SHlQM. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open

Abstract = {{Our aim was to describe the pattern of ventriculostomy-related infection
   (VRI) development using a dynamic approach.
   Retrospective longitudinal study.
   We analyzed the files of 449 neurosurgical patients who underwent
   placement of external ventricular drain (EVD). During the study period,
   CSF sampling was performed on a daily base setting. VRI was defined as a
   positive CSF culture resulting in antibiotic treatment. For VRI
   patients, we arbitrary defined day 0 (D0) as the day antibiotic
   treatment was started. In these patients, we compared dynamic changes in
   clinical and biological parameters at four pre-determined time points:
   (D-4, D-3, D-2, D-1) with those of D0. For all CSF-positive cultures, we
   compared CSF biochemical markers' evolution pattern between VRI patients
   and the others, considered as a control cohort.
   Thirty-two suffered from VRI. Peripheral white blood cell count did not
   differ between D-4-D0. Median body temperature, CSF cell count, median
   Glasgow Coma Scale, CSF protein, and glucose concentrations were
   significantly different between D-4, D-3, D-2, and D0. At D0, 100 \% of
   CSF samples yielded organisms in culture. The physician caring for the
   patient decided to treat VRI based upon positive CSF culture in only 28
   \% (9/32) of cases. In the control cohort, CSF markers' profile trends
   to normalize, while it worsens in the VRI patients.
   We showed that clinical symptoms and biological abnormalities of VRI
   evolved over time. Our data suggest that VRI decision to treat relies
   upon a bundle of evidence, including dynamic changes in CSF laboratory
   exams combined with microbiological analysis.}},

   between XPR1 variations or expression changes, in a few neuropsychiatric

   phlebotomine sandflies as its proven vectors in Argentina, and infected
   dogs as its main urban reservoir. In Puerto Iguazu City (Misiones

   Additionally, in the rural area known as ``2000 Hectareas{''}, less than
   10 km away from the city, several human cases of Tegumentary
   Leishmaniasis (TL) were registered determining an endemic area with
   Leishmania braziliensis as the etiological agent. Because of this,
   several phlebotomine captures were done in this site showing that
   Nyssomyia whitmani is the most abundant sandfly followed by Migonemyia
   migonei. In this study, three of the sandflies captured were found
   infected whit L. infantum parasites, detected by PCR and sequencing. Two
   of them were N. whitmani and the other one was a M. migonei specimen,
   being this the first report off.. infantum natural infection for
   Argentina in these sandfly species. N. whitmani is the main vector of L.
   braziliensis in this area, and M. migonei has been suggested as a
   putative vector in other locations where human and canine cases of VL
   where reported with L. longipalpis apparently absent. In this context,
   we consider necessary further studies that could define the role of M.
   migonei and N. whitmani as specific or permissive vectors of L infantum,
   their vectorial competence and capacity, and their actual role in the

Abstract = {{A snapshot full-Stokes division-of-aperture imaging polarimeter using a
   Wollaston prism array (WPA) is theoretically described and
   experimentally demonstrated. Two-dimensional spatial distributions of
   six polarization eigenstates, linear (0 degrees, 90 degrees, 45 degrees,
   135 degrees), and left and right circular polarization states, are
   identified and separated by the WPA simultaneously and projected onto
   the six portions of a single focal-plane array by a lens array. The
   conditions of the measurement matrix formed by the six polarization
   modulation channels are naturally superior for immunity to Gaussian and
   Poisson noise. The unique properties of the WPA, such as its high
   extinction ratio, optical efficiency and transmittance, can further
   ensure the achievement of immunity. The snapshot principle and the
   conditions of the measurement matrix are discussed. A proof-ofconcept
   system using a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor for
   visible light is built and validated using laboratory and outdoor

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the potential for potato farmer groups to empower
   women in Malawi. It does this by examining how social and gender norms
   in communities, including the distribution of power, resources and
   responsibilities, may have an impact on the ability of farmer groups to
   empower female group participants. In total, 35 sex-disaggregated focus
   group discussions with farmers, and 4 interviews with extension officers
   were conducted in Dedza and Ntcheu districts. Data on social and gender
   norms that may promote or constrain the participation of both men and
   women in groups and limit their benefits were collected and analyzed. A
   social relations approach, focusing on gender relations, was used to
   analyze the data. A key finding was that, underlying gender and cultural
   norms may affect the ability of women to participate actively in groups
   as well as to take advantage of the empowerment potential of groups.
   Findings suggest that while farmer groups have the potential to empower
   women, reproduction of societal gender roles within groups may result in
   male bias, constraining the ability of groups to empower women. Key
   implications are that agricultural research organizations interested in
   women's empowerment should work closely with partners who have
   experience in women's empowerment because farmer group participation may
   not empower women if underlying social issues that result in gender
   inequality are not addressed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   The dppz complex intercalatively binds to calf-thymus DNA with binding
   constant (K-b) values of similar to 10(6) M-1. This complex exhibits low
   chemical nuclease activity but excellent DNA photocleavage activity when
   irradiated with red light of 705 nm forming (OH)-O-center dot radical.
   It displays remarkable photocytotoxicity in human cervical cancer cells
   (HeLa) giving IC50 value of 0.9 mu M in visible light (400-700 nm) while
   being less toxic in darkness (IC50 : 23 mu M). The cellular uptake of
   the complexes seems to be via VB6 transporting membrane carrier mediated
   diffusion pathway. Photo-induced cell death follows apoptotic pathway
   involving photo-generated intracellular reactive oxygen species.}},

Abstract = {{Fluoroquinolone-resistant staphylococci (FQRS) are primarily selected in
   the nasal microbiota during fluoroquinolone (FQ) treatment. To gain
   insight into the dynamics of the emergence of FQRS, 49 hospitalised
   patients (HPs) and 62 community patients (CPs) treated with FQs were
   studied. Nasal swabs were collected before (TO), at the end of (T1) and
   1 month after (T2) FQ treatment. FQRS were identified by mass
   spectrometry. Antibiotic resistance was determined. Pre- and
   post-exposure staphylococci populations were compared phenotypically and
   by MLST to determine the origin of FQRS. At TO, 33149 HPs (67\%) and
   24162 CPs (39\%) carried FQRS (OR = 3.3, 95\% CI: 1.4-7.9; P < 0.001).
   Among patients with no FQRS at TO, 15116 HPs (94\%) and 16138 CPs (42\%)
   had FQRS detected at T1 and/or T2 (OR = 19.6,95\% CI: 2.5-902; < 0.001).
   Among FQRS having emerged, co-resistance to meticillin was detected in
   87\% and 82\% of HPs and CPs, respectively. No selection of resistance
   emerging from the initial microbiota was evidenced. FQRS showed
   decreased species diversity in favour of Staphylococcus haemolyticus and
   Staphylococcus epidermidis. As a consequence of FQ treatment,
   acquisition of FQRS in the nasal microbiota is frequent in the community
   and almost inevitable in hospitals. Acquisition from extranasal sites
   prevails. A restriction in species diversity in favour of more
   pathogenic and resistant species occurs. This highlights the major
   impact of FQ treatment on nasal microbiota, the role of the ecological
   environment in the emergence of FQRS, and the high-risk of dissemination
   of resistant staphylococci. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and the International

Journal = {{WORLD NEUROSURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{84}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: We report a case of an internal carotid artery (ICA)
   aneurysm anomalously originating from the posterior communicating artery
   (PComA).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Preoperative radiologic findings revealed a
   paraclinoid carotid artery aneurysm at the level of the distal dural
   ring. Because of the low rupture risk, there are no treatment
   indications for small paraclinoid or ICA-superior hypophyseal artery
   unruptured aneurysms. In this case, because of the patient's age and the
   irregular shape of the aneurysm, treatment was considered necessary.
   Intraoperative findings using microscopic and endoscopic angiography
   showed that the aneurysm originated from the proximal branched PComA.
   The PComA originated from the same level as the ophthalmic artery, and
   the superior hypophyseal artery originated from the distal side of the
   PComA.
   CONCLUSIONS: According to numerous reports, small incidental paraclinoid
   aneurysms have a lower risk of rupture and growth than PComA aneurysms.
   Preoperative radiologic examination of unruptured small aneurysms was
   performed using magnetic resonance angiography and three-dimensional
   computed tomography angiography. Because the ability of magnetic
   resonance angiography and three-dimensional computed tomography
   angiography to detect small branches of the ICA is inferior to digital
   subtraction angiography, the location of an unruptured ICA aneurysm
   should be evaluated with other diagnostic modalities besides magnetic
   resonance angiography and three-dimensional computed tomography
   angiography.}},

   at least 22 weeks of gestation and born in district or tertiary referral
   hospitals in Kigali from July 2013 to May 2014. Perinatal deaths were
   recorded as they occurred, with the next two surviving neonates born in
   the same hospital selected as controls. Conditional logistic regression
   was used to determine social determinants of perinatal death after
   adjustments for potential confounders.
   Results: We analysed 234 perinatal deaths and 468 controls. Rural
   residence was linked to an increased risk of perinatal death (OR = 3.31,
   95\% CI 1.43-7.61), but maternal education or household asset score
   levels were not. Having no health insurance (OR = 2.11, 95\% CI
   0.91-4.89) was associated with an increased risk of perinatal death,
   compared to having community health insurance.
   Conclusion: Living in a rural area and having no health insurance were
   associated with an increased risk of perinatal mortality rates in the
   Rwandan capital, but maternal education and household assets were not.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we investigated the efficiency of rosmarinic acid
   (RA) in preventing the alteration of oxidative parameters in the liver
   and kidney of diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin (STZ). The animals
   were divided into six groups (n = 8): control, ethanol, RA 10 mg/kg,
   diabetic, diabetic/ethanol, and diabetic/RA 10 mg/kg. After 3 weeks of
   treatment, we found that TBARS levels in liver and kidney were
   significantly increased in the diabetic/saline group and the
   administration of RA prevented this increase in the liver and kidney (P
   < 0.05). Diabetes caused a significant decrease in the activity of
   superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the diabetes/saline
   group (P < 0.05). However, the treatment with 10 mg/kg RA (antioxidant)
   prevented this alteration in SOD and CAT activity in the diabetic RA
   group (P < 0.05). In addition, RA reverses the decrease in ascorbic acid
   and non-protein-thiol (NPSH) levels in diabetic rats. The treatment with
   RA also prevented the decrease in the Delta-aminolevulinic acid
   dehydratase (ALA-D) activity in the liver and kidney of diabetic rats.
   Furthermore, RA did not have any effect on glycemic levels. These
   results indicate that RA effectively reduced the oxidative stress
   induced by STZ, suggesting that RA is a potential candidate for the
   prevention and treatment of pathological conditions in diabetic models.}},

Abstract = {{The vertebrate heart develops from two distinct lineages of
   cardiomyocytes that arise from the first and second heart fields (FHF
   and SHF, respectively). The FHF forms the primitive heart tube, while
   adding cells from the SHF allows elongation at both poles of the tube.
   Initially seen as an exclusive characteristic of higher vertebrates,
   recent work has demonstrated the presence of a distinct FHF and SHF in
   lower vertebrates, including zebrafish. We found that key transcription
   factors that regulate septation and chamber formation in higher
   vertebrates, including Tbx5 and Pitx2, influence relative FHF and SHF
   contributions to the zebrafish heart tube. To identify molecular
   modulators of heart field migration, we used microarray-based expression
   profiling following inhibition of tbx5a and pitx2ab in embryonic
   zebrafish (Mosimann \& Panakova, et al, 2015; GSE70750). Here, we
   describe in more detail the procedure used to process, prioritize, and
   analyze the expression data for functional enrichment. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the oldest threats to public health. TB is
   caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). The Sigma
   factors are essential for the survival of MTB. The Sigma factor Sigma F
   (SigF) regulates genes expression under stress conditions. The SigF
   binds to RNA polymerase and forms a holoenzyme, which initiates the
   transcription of various genes. The Usfx, an anti-SigF protein, binds to
   SigF and alters the transcription initiation and gene expression. In the
   present work, virtual screening studies are taken up to identify the
   interactions between SigF and small molecular inhibitors which can
   inhibit the formation of holoenzyme. The studies reveal that ARG 104 and
   ARG 224 amino acid residues of SigF protein are forming important
   binding interactions with the ligands. The in silico ADME properties for
   the ligand data set are calculated to check the druggability of the
   molecules. (C) 2015 Asian African Society for Mycobacteriology.

Abstract = {{Russell bodies represent a cellular response to overstimulation of
   plasma cells, leading to the accumulation of abundant, nondegradable,
   condensed immunoglobulin in dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum
   cisternae. Russell body gastritis was first described 1998 by Tazawa and
   Tsutsumi. Since then only 39 cases involving the gastrointestinal tract
   have been reported in English literature, which include Russell body
   gastritis, duodenitis, and esophagitis. We report a case of a
   44-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, status post
   kidney and pancreas transplant who presented with multiple episodes of
   watery diarrhea associated with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
   Upper gastroendoscopic examination showed diffuse mild erythema in the
   gastric body and a clean-based duodenal ulcer. Lower gastroendoscopic
   examination was normal. Examination of multiple biopsies from duodenal,
   gastric, terminal ileum, and colonic mucosae revealed numerous plasma
   cells with abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm (Russell bodies) and
   eccentric nuclei, highlighted by PAS stain and CD 138 plasma cell
   marker. Helicobacter pylori stains were performed on gastric biopsies
   and were negative for organisms. To date, there are no cases described
   in English literature with multifocal Russell body infiltrates in
   gastrointestinal tract in a single patient including ileum and/or colon.
   This makes our case the first to be reported with these unique findings;
   thus, the spectrum of Russell body-associated chronic inflammation of
   the gastrointestinal tract would be more suitably referred to as Russell
   body gastroenterocolitis.}},

Title = {{Risk factors for discharge against medical advice in patients with UGI
   bleeding or abdominal pain: a study of 170 discharges against medical
   advice among 11,996 emergency department visits}},
Journal = {{MINERVA GASTROENTEROLOGICA E DIETOLOGICA}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aim. The aim of this study was to identify rate of and risk factors for
   patients leaving against medical advice (AMA) from the emergency
   department (ED) with abdominal pain or upper gastrointestinal (GI)
   bleeding.
   Methods. The National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey is a
   limited access dataset that includes ED visit data. All patients who
   left AMA between years 2007-2009 who had the diagnosis of upper GI
   bleeding or abdominal pain were studied. The following demographic
   factors were analyzed as potential risk factors for discharge AMA:
   patient age, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic location, annual income,
   type of insurance, urban versus rural status, prior ED visits, ED
   waiting time, and diagnosis of psychiatric illness.
   Results. From 2007-2009, a total of 104,566 ED visits were analyzed, of
   which 1135 (1.1\%) were ED visits of patients leaving AMA. Among those
   leaving AMA, 170 patients (1.4\%) leaving AMA presented with upper GI
   bleeding or abdominal pain. Of nine analyzed parameters, only two
   parameters statistically significantly affected the rate of leaving AMA.
   First, patients aged 19-44 years were significantly more likely to leave
   AMA (P=0.001, odds ratio (OR)=1.67; 95\%-CI: 1.212.32) whereas patient
   aged > 65 years were less likely to leave AMA with upper GI bleeding or
   abdominal pain (P=0.01; OR=0.49; 95\%-CI: 0.27-0.87). Second, patients
   with 1-5 prior ED visits were significantly more likely to leave AMA
   than other patients (P=0.009; OR=1.85; 95\% CI: 1.15-2.97). Patients
   with psychiatric illness tended to have a greater risk of leaving AMA,
   with borderline statistical significance (P=0.04) Gender,
   race/ethnicity, geographic region, type of insurance, urban status, and
   waiting-time > 60 minutes did not significantly affect AMA discharge
   rates.
   Conclusion. This study identifies risk factors for leaving AMA,
   including young age (19-44 years old), 1-5 prior ED visits within the
   prior 2 years, and psychiatric illness. Physicians may use these data to
   help design targeted strategies, based on the identified risk factors,
   to reduce AMA discharges.}},

Title = {{ShcA Protects against Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition through
   Compartmentalized Inhibition of TGF-beta-Induced Smad Activation}},
Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a normal cell differentiation
   event during development and contributes pathologically to carcinoma and
   fibrosis progression. EMT often associates with increased transforming
   growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling, and TGF-beta drives EMT, in
   part through Smad-mediated reprogramming of gene expression. TGF-beta
   also activates the Erk MAPK pathway through recruitment and Tyr
   phosphorylation of the adaptor protein ShcA by the activated TGF-beta
   type I receptor. We found that ShcA protects the epithelial integrity of
   nontransformed cells against EMT by repressing TGF-beta-induced,
   Smad-mediated gene expression. p52ShcA competed with Smad3 for TGF-beta
   receptor binding, and down-regulation of ShcA expression enhanced
   autocrine TGF-beta/Smad signaling and target gene expression, whereas
   increased p52ShcA expression resulted in decreased Smad3 binding to the
   TGF-beta receptor, decreased Smad3 activation, and increased Erk MAPK
   and Akt signaling. Furthermore, p52ShcA sequestered TGF-beta receptor
   complexes to caveolin-associated membrane compartments, and reducing
   ShcA expression enhanced the receptor localization in
   clathrin-associated membrane compartments that enable Smad activation.
   Consequently, silencing ShcA expression induced EMT, with increased cell
   migration, invasion, and dissemination, and increased stem cell
   generation and mammosphere formation, dependent upon autocrine TGF-beta
   signaling. These findings position ShcA as a determinant of the
   epithelial phenotype by repressing TGF-beta-induced Smad activation
   through differential partitioning of receptor complexes at the cell
   surface.}},

Abstract = {{Carotenoids play vital role in growth and development of human beings.
   Yellow maize kernel contains carotenoids that possess provitamin A and
   antioxidant activity. Multilocation based analyses of 105 maize inbreds
   of indigenous and exotic origin revealed wide genetic variation for
   lutein (0.2-11.3 mu g/g), zeaxanthin (0.2-20.0 mu g/g) and beta-carotene
   (0.0-15.0 mu g/g). For beta-cryptoxanthin, low variation (0.1-3.3 mu
   g/g) was observed. Carotenoids were quite stable over environments that
   played minor role in causing variation. The heritability (> 90\%) and
   genetic advance (>75\%) were high for all the carotenoid components.
   Zeaxanthin showed positive correlation with lutein and
   beta-cryptoxanthin, while beta-carotene, the major provitamin A
   carotenoid, did not show correlation with other carotenoids. Kernel
   colour was positively correlated with lutein (0.25), zeaxanthin (0.47)
   and beta-cryptoxanthin (0.44), but not with beta-carotene (0.04). This
   suggested that visual selection based on kernel colour will be
   misleading in selecting provitamin A-rich genotypes. Inbreds with
   provitamin A and non-provitamin A carotenoids identified in the present
   study will help in development of biofortified maize hybrids.}},

Title = {{Significant gas-to-dust ratio asymmetry and variation in the disk of HD
   142527 and the indication of gas depletion}},
Journal = {{PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the dust and gas distribution in the disk around HD
   142527 based on ALMA observations of dust continuum emissions, (CO)-C-13
   J = 3-2 and (CO)-O-18 J = 3-2. The disk shows strong azimuthal asymmetry
   in the dust continuum emission, while gas emission is more symmetric. In
   this paper, we investigate how gas and dust are distributed in the
   dust-bright northern part of the disk and in the dust-faint southern
   part. We construct two axisymmetric disk models. One reproduces the
   radial profiles of the continuum and the velocity moments 0 and 1 of CO
   lines in the north, and the other reproduces those in the south. We have
   found that the dust is concentrated in a narrow ring of similar to 50 au
   width (in FWHM; omega(d) = 30 au in our parameter definition), located
   at similar to 170-200 au from the central star. The dust particles are
   strongly concentrated in the north. We have found that the dust surface
   density contrast between the north and the south amounts to similar to
   70. Compared to the dust, the gas distribution is more extended in the
   radial direction. We find that the gas component extends at least from
   similar to 100 au to similar to 250 au from the central star, and there
   should also be tenuous gas remaining inside and outside of these radii.
   The azimuthal asymmetry of gas distribution is much smaller than dust.
   The gas surface density differs only by a factor of similar to 3-10
   between the north and south. Hence, the gas-to-dust ratio strongly
   depends on the location of the disk: similar to 30 at the location of
   the peak of dust distribution in the south and similar to 3 at the
   location of the peak of dust distribution in the north. Despite large
   uncertainties, we infer that the overall gas-to-dust ratio is similar to
   10-30, indicating that the gas depletion may already have been under
   way.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of this study was to clarify the influence of
   mechanical unloading on histological changes of the patellar tendon (PT)
   insertion in rabbits.
   Materials and methods: The PT was completely released from stress by
   drawing the patella toward the tibial tubercle with a stainless steel
   wire installed between the patella and tibial tubercle (mechanical
   unloading group, n = 28). The animals of the sham group underwent the
   same surgical procedure; however, the wire was not tightened (n = 28).
   The average thickness of the Safranin O-stained glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
   area, chondrocyte apoptosis rate and chondrocyte proliferation rate of
   the cartilage layer at the insertion were measured at one, two, four,
   and six weeks.
   Results: The chondrocyte apoptosis rate in the mechanical unloading
   group was significantly higher than that in the sham group at one and
   four weeks (p < 0.05). The chondrocyte proliferation rate in the
   mechanical unloading group was significantly lower than that in the sham
   group at four and six weeks (p<0.05). The average thickness of the
   GAG-stained area in the mechanical unloading group was significantly
   lower than that in the sham group at six weeks (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: Mechanical unloading significantly affected the increase in
   the chondrocyte apoptosis rate, decrease in the chondrocyte
   proliferation rate, and decrease in the GAG layer thickness at the PT
   insertion for up to six weeks in rabbits. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Methane (CH4) is a readily available feedstock for production of
   polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). The structure and PHA production capacity
   of a Methylocystis-dominated methanotrophic enrichment was stable in
   long-term operation (>175 days) when grown exponentially under
   non-aseptic conditions in fill-and-draw batch cultures with ammonium as
   nitrogen source. Cells harvested in the draw step were incubated in the
   absence of nitrogen with various combinations of CH4 and valerate to
   assess capacity for synthesis of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) and
   poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV). When fed CH4 alone,
   only P3HB was produced. When fed CH4 plus valerate, PHBV was
   synthesized. The mol\% of 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) increased with added
   valerate. Oxidation of CH4 was required for valerate assimilation, and
   the fraction of CH4 oxidized increased with increased mol\% 3HV. By
   separating PHA accumulation from cell replication, tailored PHA-rich
   biomass can be generated by addition of co-substrate, while retaining a
   large inoculum for the next cycle of cell division. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The conservation of Toxoplasma gondii strains isolated from humans and
   animals is essential for conducting studies on Toxoplasma. Conservation
   is the main function of the French Biological Toxoplasma Resource Centre
   (BRC Toxoplasma, France, http://www.toxocrb.com/). In this study, we
   have determined the suitability of a standard cryopreservation
   methodology for different Toxoplasma strains using the viability of
   tachyzoites assayed by flow cytometry with dual fluorescent labelling
   (calcein acetoxymethyl ester and propidium iodide) of tachyzoites. This
   method provides a comparative quantitative assessment of viability after
   thawing. The results helped to define and refine quality criteria before
   tachyzoite cryopreservation and optimization of the cryopreservation
   parameters. The optimized cryopreservation method uses a volume of 1.0
   mL containing 8 x 10(6) tachyzoites, in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's
   Medium (IMDM) containing 10\% foetal calf serum (FCS). The
   cryoprotectant additive is 10\% v/v Me2SO without incubation. A cooling
   rate of similar to 1 degrees C/min to -80 degrees C followed, after 48
   h, by storage in liquid nitrogen. Thawing was performed using a 37
   degrees C water bath that produced a warming rate of similar to 100
   degrees C/min, and samples were then diluted 1:5 in IMDM with 5\% FCS,
   and centrifuged and resuspended for viability assessment. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The physical properties like density/porosity, stress-strain behavior
   and energy absorption of organic gelatin/phenolic micro balloon (PMB)
   composite is studied with respect to its water content and content of
   phenolic micro balloon. Quasi static compression tests and low velocity
   impact (LVI) tests are conducted on the gelatin/PMB composite samples
   with three different gelatin to water ratios (by weight) 1G:2W, 1G:3W
   and 1G:4W and four PMB contents 0\%, 2.5\%, 5\% and 10\% of the combined
   gelatin-water weight. The stress-strain behavior of the composite is
   studied through quasi-static compression tests at different loading
   rates. Low velocity impact tests are conducted to check the energy
   absorption of specimens and high speed videos of the impact tests were
   acquired to analyze the behavior of gelatin/PMB composite. The
   stress-strain tests show that the stiffness of the composite is
   dependent on both PMB and water content and that the behavior of
   composite is strain rate dependent or viscoelastic. The high speed
   imaging of the LVI tests conform with the energy absorption calculations
   that gelatin's energy absorption capability increases with increase in
   the water content as the lateral spread (and consequently the vertical
   compression of the.composite samples) increases with water content.
   Further the stiffness of the composite increases with the increase of
   PMB content and reduction of water content. It is also found that 1G:4W
   composite with 0\% PMB content absorbs the maximum energy and hence is
   ideal for energy absorption purpose.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a Navis-MicroRider microstructure float and an EM-APEX
   float were deployed along the Kuroshio Extension Front. The observations
   deeper than 150 m reveal widespread interleaving thermohaline structures
   for at least 900 km along the front, presumably generated through
   mesoscale stirring and near-inertial oscillations. In these interleaving
   structures, microscale thermal dissipation rates are very high O(>10-7
   K(2)s(-1)), while turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates E are
   relatively low O(10-10-10-9 Wkg(-1)), with effective thermal diffusivity
   K of O(10-3 m(2)s(-1)) consistent with the previous parameterizations
   for double-diffusion, and, K is two orders of magnitude larger than the
   turbulent eddy diffusivity for density K. The average observed
   dissipation ratio in salt finger and diffusive convection favorable
   conditions are 1.2 and 4.0, respectively, and are larger than that for
   turbulence. Our results suggest that mesoscale subduction/obduction and
   near-inertial motions could catalyze double-diffusive favorable
   conditions, and thereby enhancing the diapycnal tracer fluxes below the

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate, in Japan Clinical Oncology Group study 0403, the
   safety and efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in
   patients with T1N0M0 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
   Methods and Materials: Eligibility criteria included histologically or
   cytologically proven NSCLC, clinical T1N0M0. Prescribed dose was 48 Gy
   at the isocenter in 4 fractions. The primary endpoint was the percent
   (\%) 3-year overall survival. The threshold \% 3-year survival to be
   rejected was set at 35\% for inoperable patients, whereas the expected
   \% 3-year survival was 80\% for operable patients.
   Results: Between July 2004 and November 2008, 169 patients from 15
   institutions were registered. One hundred inoperable and 64 operable
   patients (total 164) were eligible. Patients' characteristics were 122
   male, 47 female; median age 78 years (range, 50-91 years);
   adenocarcinomas, 90; squamous cell carcinomas, 61; others, 18. Of the
   100 inoperable patients, the \% 3-year OS was 59.9\% (95\% confidence
   interval 49.6\%-68.8\%). Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were observed in 10
   and 2 patients, respectively. No grade 5 toxicity was observed. Of the
   64 operable patients, the \% 3-year OS was 76.5\% (95\% confidence
   interval 64.0\%-85.1\%). Grade 3 toxicities were observed in 5 patients.
   No grade 4 and 5 toxicities were observed.
   Conclusions: Stereotactic body radiation therapy for stage I NSCLC is
   effective, with low incidences of severe toxicity. This treatment can be
   considered a standard treatment for inoperable stage I NSCLC. This
   treatment is promising as an alternative to surgery for operable stage I
   NSCLC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fertilization, the union of male and female gametes to create offspring,
   is an intricate biological process dependent upon several biochemical
   and physiological events. Our understanding of the functions of protein
   constituents of the outer acrosomal membrane-associated matrix complex
   (OMC) is limited. A highly purified OMC fraction isolated from bovine
   cauda sperm heads comprised 54, 50, 45, and 38-19 kDa polypeptides. The
   objective of this study is to identify and characterize the 45 kDa
   (OMC45) polypeptide, to define its role in binding acrosomal hydrolases,
   and to examine the fate of OMC45 polypeptide during the acrosome
   reaction. We isolated OMC45 polypeptide from the high-pH insoluble
   fraction of OMC. Proteomic analysis of OMC45 by MALDI-TOF-TOF yielded
   eight peptides that matched the NCBI database sequence of Tektin 3
   (TEKT3). Triton X-100-permeabilized cauda sperm exhibited intense
   staining of the acrosomal segment with anti-OMC45 and anti-TEKT3. The
   OMC45 polypeptide was solubilized by radio-immunoprecipitation assay
   buffer extraction. The solubilized fraction was subjected to
   immunoprecipitation analysis. The OMC45 polypeptide was recovered in the
   anti-OMC45 immunoprecipitation pellet. An identical blot stained with
   anti-TEKT3 exhibited the presence of TEKT3 polypeptide in the anti-OMC45
   pellet. Our immunofluorescence and biochemical studies confirm the
   proteomics identification of OMC45 polypeptide and that it exhibits a
   sequence similarity to TEKT3. OMC45 glycoprotein possesses both N-linked
   and O-linked oligosaccharides. Deglycosylated OMC45 revealed a
   significant reduction in both acrosin and N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGA)
   binding in comparison with acrosin and NAGA binding to a native OMC45
   polypeptide, demonstrating the important role of oligosaccharides in
   hydrolase binding. OMC45 polypeptide is not released during the acrosome
   reaction but remains in the particulate cell subfraction, associated
   with the hybrid membrane complex.}},

Abstract = {{We examined whether and how levels of richness in detail, a fundamental
   cue for truthfulness in the Reality Monitoring (RM) tool, change as a
   function of the interviewee's gender and his/her awareness of this
   indicator. We collected 160 true and false accounts, written by males
   and females. Half the participants were informed about the RM criteria,
   and were encouraged to include them in their accounts. Results
   demonstrated gender differences in levels of richness for uninformed
   participants. Specifically, uninformed-females provided better truthful
   accounts than uninformed-males, and differences in richness between
   truths and lies emerged only for uninformed-females. Gender differences
   in levels of richness were eliminated when participants were informed,
   and discrimination between lies and truths was no longer possible. These
   findings suggest that the interviewee's gender must be considered when
   using richness as an indicator for truthfulness, and that the indicator
   of richness is vulnerable to countermeasures. (C) 2015 Society for

Abstract = {{The FDA approved lenvatinib (Lenvima, Eisai Inc.) for the treatment of

   iodine-refractory (RAI-refractory) differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).
   In an international, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled
   trial (E7080-G000-303), 392 patients with locally recurrent or
   metastatic RAI-refractory DTC and radiographic evidence of disease
   progression within 12 months prior to randomization were randomly
   allocated (2: 1) to receive either lenvatinib 24 mg orally per day (n =
   261) or matching placebo (n = 131) with the option for patients on the
   placebo arm to receive lenvatinib following independent radiologic
   confirmation of disease progression. A statistically significant
   prolongation of progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by
   independent radiology review was demonstrated {[}HR, 0.21; 95\%
   confidence interval (CI), 0.16-0.28; P < 0.001, stratified log-rank

   hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, arthralgia/ myalgia, decreased
   appetite, decreased weight, nausea, stomatitis, headache, vomiting,
   proteinuria, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, abdominal pain,
   and dysphonia. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 68\% of

   discontinued lenvatinib for adverse reactions leading to residual
   uncertainty regarding the optimal dose of lenvatinib. (C) 2015 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{The thermodynamical and microphysical response during the transition
   from southwest to northeast monsoon season is studied. Unique mixed
   phase cloud observations from the Cloud Aerosol Interaction and
   Precipitation Enhancement Experiment (CAIPEEX) and ground based
   observations from Integrated Ground Observation Campaign (IGOC), high
   resolution (3 km) mesoscale forecasts with the nested Weather Research
   and Forecasting (WRF) model are used in the study. Convective available
   potential energy (CAPE), liquid water path (LWP) and precipitable water
   (PW) increased 3 days before the onset and further enhanced with the
   onset of the northeast monsoon. A systematic decrease in lifting
   condensation level (LCL) height and increase in midlevel moisture before
   and during the onset period are observed, which resulted in increase in
   moist static energy in the midlayer for supporting deeper convection
   during the onset. Cloud microphysical response is noted with the mixed
   phase cloud observations of liquid water and ice water content. The
   model has simulated the mixed phase clouds in the area of detailed
   observations. Major cloud microphysical changes observed are (a) shallow
   warm clouds before the onset, (b) elevated supercooled liquid water
   content at the tops of clouds and (c) low ice water content during the
   onset period compared to subsequent periods after the onset with more
   ice water content. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzes a mixed duopoly composed of a social
   welfare-maximizing public firm and a relative profit-maximizing private
   firm wherein the owners of both firms hire relative profit-maximizing
   managers biased with respect to the market size they face. In
   particular, we explore the quantity competition that gives a result
   different from that obtained in a standard mixed duopoly that
   differentiates between ownership and management, as considered by
   (Nakamura, Theor Econ Lett 4(3), 889-896, 2014a), which follows the
   approach of (Englmaier, and Reisinger, Manag Decis Econ 35(5), 350-356,
   2013). More precisely, when we introduce the degree of importance of
   each firm's relative performance into quantity competition, we see that
   the owner of the private firm reverts to a less aggressive manager when
   the degree of importance is relatively high, which is similar to how the
   classical strategic managerial delegation works. Furthermore, we
   consider the influence of an increase in degree of importance of each
   firm's relative performance on the aggressiveness of managers hired by
   both the public and private firm. Moreover, we explore the case in which
   the owner hires his manager with salary based on social welfare.}},

Abstract = {{In the routing design of interposer and etc., the combination of a pin
   pair to be connected by wire is often flexible, and the reductions of
   the total wire length and the length difference are pursued to keep the
   circuit performance. Even though the total wire length can be minimized
   by finding a minimum cost maximum flow in set pair routing problems, the
   length difference is often large, and the reduction of it is not easy.
   In this paper, an algorithm that reduces the length difference while
   keeping the total wire length small is proposed. In the proposed
   algorithm, an initial routing first obtained by a minimum cost maximum
   flow. Then it is modified to reduce the maximum length while keeping the
   minimum total wire length, and a connection of the minimum length is
   detoured to reduce the length difference. The effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithm is confirmed by experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Evidence about IP-OP suction and selective tracheal
   intubation in meconium stained neonates is from developed countries.
   Little information is available about their role in developing countries
   with high incidence of meconium staining and MAS. This randomized trial
   was planned to evaluate the effectiveness of IP-OP suction in meconium
   stained term neonates on prevention of MAS and reduction of its
   severity.
   Patients and methods: Out of 540 meconium stained full term, cephalic
   presentation, singleton neonates without major congenital malformations
   born from June'08 to January'09, 31 were excluded and 509 randomized. In
   the intervention group IP-OP suction was done at the time of delivery of
   head using a 10 Fr suction catheter with a negative pressure of 100
   mmHg. No IP-OP suction was performed in control group. All neonates with
   MSAF were assessed as vigorous or non-vigorous after birth and provided
   care as per NRP guidelines 2005.
   Results: Two hundred and fifty three neonates were randomized to IP-OP
   suction and 256 to no IP-OP suction. Eighty-two neonates (16\%)
   developed MAS, the primary outcome parameter, with 40 infants in the
   intervention group (15.8\%) and 42 (16.4\%) in the non-intervention
   group (RR 0.86, 95\% CI 0.60-1.54). Incidence of severe MAS was
   comparable (3.55\% vs. 2.34\%) (P value = 0.40). Other variables like
   requirement of oxygen >48 h (9.8\% vs. 10.5\%) and mortality (2.7\% vs.
   1.7\%) were also comparable.
   Conclusions: IP-OP suctioning did not reduce the incidence or severity
   of MAS even in a setting of high incidence of MAS in a developing
   country. The mortality in two groups was comparable. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Health care-acquired infections (HAIs) constitute an
   increasing threat for patients worldwide. Potential contributors of HAIs
   include environmental surfaces in health care settings, where
   ultraviolet-C radiation (UV-C) is commonly used for disinfection. This
   UV-C intervention-based pilot study was conducted in a hospital setting
   to identify any change in the incidence of HAIs before and after UV-C
   intervention, and to determine the effectiveness of UV-C in reducing
   pathogens.
   Methods: In a hospital in Culver City, CA, during 2012-2013,
   bactericidal doses of UV-C radiation (254 nm) were delivered through a
   UV-C-based mobile environmental decontamination unit. The UV-C dosing
   technology and expertise of the specifically trained personnel were
   provided together as a dedicated service model by a contracted company.
   The incidence of HAIs before and after the intervention period were
   determined and compared.
   Results: The dedicated service model dramatically reduced HAIs
   (incidence difference, 1.3/1000 patient-days, a 34.2\% reduction).
   Reductions in the total number and incidence proportions (28.8\%) of
   HAIs were observed after increasing and maintaining the coverage of UV-C
   treatments.
   Conclusion: The dedicated service model was found to be effective in
   decreasing the incidence of HAIs, which could reduce disease morbidity
   and mortality in hospitalized patients. This model provides a
   continuously monitored and frequently UV-C-treated patient environment.
   This approach to UV-C disinfection was associated with a decreased
   incidence of HAIs. Copyright (C) 2015 by the Association for

Abstract = {{Effective management of artisanal fisheries requires understanding
   fishers, their behaviors, and the drivers that underpin their choices.
   Behavioral drivers are critical links in understanding the interactions
   between social and ecological systems and can help inform effective
   management approaches. A Bayesian Belief Network modeling approach was
   used to investigate a diverse range of qualitative and quantitative
   social and ecological drivers of spatial location choice in a
   multi-species artisanal dive fishery in Costa Rica. Empirical and
   observer data used to populate the BBN showed the influence of economic
   factors, environmental conditions as well as social interactions on the
   decision-making process of spatial location choice. Good governance
   scenarios represented by Responsible Fisheries Marine Areas Management
   were analyzed for both hookah and free diving methods to assess the
   effects of responsible fishing on the fishers and the fishery. Model
   based-scenario analysis suggests that management interventions should
   consider the fisher's potential behavioral responses in the context of
   environmental variability, dependence on cultural assets, and food
   security. The results show that there is a need to understand fisher's
   decisions based on broad socio-ecological system understanding and
   consider the environmental outcomes alongside food security and the
   cultural significance of different marine species to fishing
   communities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Synchronous hatching occurs in many reptiles that lay multi-egg

   exclusively in the morning and was approximately normally distributed
   around the transition from dark to light, with most (94\%) eggs hatching
   61 hour from the onset of light. Hatching times differed significantly
   between sexes, such that most males hatched after the onset of light
   (71\%), whereas only half of all females hatched after the onset of
   light (52\%). That a substantial proportion of eggs (38\% across sexes)
   hatched in the dark suggests circadian entrainment to photoperiod,
   rather than a direct behavioral response to light. Whether this reflects
   a natural circadian rhythm of hatching or an artifact of increased light
   exposure in our artificial incubation environment is presently unknown.
   If this circadian rhythm of hatching is a natural phenomenon, then its
   potential fitness benefits (e.g., optimal timing for predator avoidance,
   prey detection, water balance, or thermoregulation) warrant further
   attention.}},

Abstract = {{Here we present a case of a 58 year old man referred to our hospital to
   undergo neck and thyroid ultrasonography (US) following palpable neck
   mass. US revealed a solid hypoechoic nodule in right thyroid lobe, and a
   solid lesion on the right laterocervical neck region with ultrasound
   suspicious features of neoplastic lymph node. In order to achieve a
   diagnosis of the neck mass and to get a proper evaluation of the thyroid
   nodule, we decided to perform a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of both
   lesions. At cytopathologic examination the thyroid nodule appeared as
   benign, while cytologic sampling of the neck lesion was inadequate for a
   proper evaluation. Thus, we performed core needle biopsy (CNB) of the
   neck lesion like recently proposed for thyroid lesions; also, to
   definitively exclude malignancy of thyroid nodule, this also underwent
   CNB. Histologic report of CNB confirmed benign thyroid nodule, while the
   neck lesion revealed a proliferation of neuronal type consistent with
   schwannoma. The patient has been addressed to clinical and
   ultrasonographic follow-up. CNB appears as a safe and minimally-invasive
   approach to diagnose indeterminate neck masses and avoid unnecessary
   diagnostic surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a highly reactive endogenous product of
   thromboxane synthesis in the prostagland and lipid peroxidation by
   reactive oxygen species. Elevated MDA levels occur in diabetes and
   atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of this study was to examine the
   molecular mechanisms of MDA-induced IL-17E cytokine expression and its
   effect on T-cell differentiation. Real-time PCR, RT-PCR and ELISA were
   used to assess the expression of IL-17 family cytokines in Jurkat
   T-cells and human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLCs) from diabetic
   subjects. Luciferase reporter assays were used for the promoter
   activation study. Pharmacological inhibitors were used for signaling
   pathway experiments. FACS analyses were used to measure the Th1, Th2 and
   Th17 subset levels. MDA induced significant (2- to 3-fold; p < 0.01)
   generation of IL-17E mRNA in a dose-and time-dependent manner in Jurkat
   T-cells and PBLCs. Elevated IL-17E mRNA levels were found in the
   lymphocytes from diabetic subjects. The increased IL-17E protein and
   mRNA levels correlate well with serum MDA levels from diabetic patients.
   Transient transfection of plasmid containing the minimum IL-17E promoter
   region (pIL-17E-Luc) showed a significant (2-fold; p < 0.01) increase in
   luciferase activity. Pretreatment of lymphocytes with pharmacological
   inhibitors showed the involvement of antioxidant, NF-kappa B, p38MAPK,
   PKC and ERK signaling pathways. Quantification of the Th1, Th2 and Th17
   cell population in PBLCs via FACS analyses revealed an increase in the
   Th17 subset. These results show that MDA transcriptionally upregulates
   the expression of IL-17E in lymphocytes and alters lymphocyte
   differentiation towards the pathogenic Th17 subset.}},

Abstract = {{Stapled haemorrhoidectomy (SH) is gradually becoming popular. Though it
   is a ``patient friendly{''} procedure, it has not become the ``gold
   standard{''}. About 15\% complication rate is reported. A perfect
   purse-string can avoid many of the complications. The author has made a
   semicircular hole in the anoscope, which has helped in taking the
   purse-string at proper depth and at proper distance from the dentate
   line. A total of 72 cases of SH are performed without any complication.
   Histopathological examination of donoughts in the first 20 cases shows
   excision up to the submucosa in 16 cases. Our modified anoscope helps in
   proper visualisation and proper pick up of the rectal wall for perfect
   purse-string suture and thus complications are avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Low-load voluntary exercise can induce muscle hypertrophy and
   strength gain in working muscles when combined with blood flow
   restriction ( BFR). However, it is unknown whether such hypertrophy and
   strength gain can be induced by involuntary muscle contractions
   triggered via low- intensity neuromuscular electrical stimulation (
   NMES) combined with BFR. The purpose of this article was to investigate
   whether low- intensity NMES combined with BFR ( NMES- BFR) could elicit
   muscle hypertrophy and strength gain in the quadriceps. Methods: Eight
   untrained young male participants ( mean +/- SE; age, 26.2 +/- 0.7 yr;
   height, 1.74 +/- 0.02 m; body weight, 71.4 +/- 4.8 kg) were subjected to
   23 min of unilateral low- intensity ( 5\%- 10\% of maximal voluntary
   contraction) NMES twice per day ( 5 dwk -1) for 2 wk: one leg received
   NMES- BFR and the other leg received NMES alone. Quadriceps muscle
   thickness and isometric and isokinetic strength were measured before and
   every week throughout the training and detraining periods. Results: In
   NMES- BFR legs, muscle thickness increased after 2 wk of training (+
   3.9\%) and decreased after 2 wk of detraining ( -3.0\%). NMES- BFR
   training also increased maximal knee extension strength in isometric (+
   14.2\%) and isokinetic (+ 7.0\% at 90 degrees s(-1) and + 8.3\% at 180
   degrees s(-1)) voluntary contractions. In addition, maximal isometric
   strength decreased ( -6.8\%), whereas no large fall ( -1.9\% at 90
   degrees s(-1) and -0.6\% at 180 degrees s(-1)) in isokinetic maximal
   strength was evident after 2 wk of detraining. In legs that received
   NMES alone, no prominent change was observed; there was a negligible
   effect on isometric strength. Conclusion: Low-intensity NMES- BFR
   induces muscle hypertrophy and strength gain in untrained young male
   participants.}},

Abstract = {{In eosinophilia-associated myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN-eo),
   constitutive activation of protein tyrosine kinases (TK) as consequence
   of translocations, inversions, or insertions and creation of TK fusion
   genes is recurrently observed. The most commonly involved TK and their
   potential TK inhibitors include PDGFRA at 4q12 or PDGFRB at 5q33
   (imatinib), FGFR1 at 8p11 (ponatinib), and JAK2 at 9p24 (ruxolitinib).
   We here report the identification of three new PDGFRB fusion genes in
   three male MPN-eo patients: MPRIP-PDGFRB in a case with
   t(5;17)(q33;p11), CPSF6-PDGFRB in a case with t(5;12)(q33;q15), and
   GOLGB1-PDGFRB in a case with t(3;5)(q13;q33). The fusion proteins
   identified by 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) or DNA-based long distance inverse PCR are predicted to
   contain the TK domain of PDGFRB. The partner genes contain domains like
   coiled-coil structures, which are likely to cause dimerization and
   activation of the TK. In all patients, imatinib induced rapid and
   durable complete remissions. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding program in Odisha was started in 1994 to improve productivity
   of coloured synthetic broiler breeder chicken. The pedigree in the
   current study descended from 69 sires and 552 dams. Genetic parameters
   were estimated using sire and dam component of variances for various
   production and reproduction traits after necessary corrections for hatch
   effects were done. Heritability in male was found to be 0.232 +/- 0.615
   for body weight at 5th week while it was high (0.718 +/- 0.129) in
   female. Age at first egg showed a low heritability (0.127 +/- 0.131)
   estimated from sire component and was 0.191 +/- 0.336 estimated from dam
   component of variance. Heritability for egg numbers up to 40 weeks
   laying was 0.624 +/- 0.439 when estimated from dam component of variance
   but, was negative from sire component. Heritability value for body
   weight at 20th week of age (male) was very high but it was low in
   females (0.035 +/- 0.134) when estimated from sire component of
   variance. Egg weight had a very high heritability value (0.644 +/-
   0.265) but egg shape index had a low value (0.150 +/- 0.240) when
   estimation was from sire component. The comparative r(g) values among
   5th week body weight, 20th week body weight, ASM, egg weight, egg
   production were significant (p < 0.05). These traits seemed to have
   additive effect of genes and utilizing them as selection traits would
   improve both egg production and growth performance of breeder broiler
   chicken.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated layered-spinel LiNi0.33Mn0.54Co0.13O2 material was
   synthesized through a self-combustion reaction (SCR), characterized by
   using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy. It was studied as a
   cathode material for Li-ion batteries and its electrochemical
   performance was compared with that of the layered cathode material
   LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 when operated over a wide potential window. The
   Rietveld analysis of LiNi0.33Mn0.54Co0.13O2 indicated the presence of
   monoclinic Li{[}Li1/3Mn2/3]O-2 (31\%) and rhombohedral (LiNixMnyCozO2)
   (62\%) phases as the major components, and the spinel (LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4)
   (7\%) as a minor component, which is supported by TEM and electron
   diffraction analyses. A discharge specific capacity of about 170mAhg(-1)
   is obtained in the potential range of 2.3-4.9V versus Li at low rate
   (C/10) with excellent capacity retention upon cycling. On the other
   hand, LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 (NMC111) synthesized through SCR exhibits
   an initial discharge capacity of about 208mAhg(-1) in the potential
   range of 2.3-4.9V, which decreases to a value of 130mAhg(-1) after only
   50 cycles. In turn, the multiphase structure of LiNi0.33Mn0.54Co0.13O2
   seems to stabilize the behavior of this cathode material, even when
   polarized to high potentials. LiNi0.33Mn0.54Co0.13O2 shows superior
   retention of the average discharge voltage upon cycling, as compared to
   that of LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 when cycled over a wide potential range.
   Overall, LiNi0.33Mn0.54Co0.13O2 can be considered as a promising
   low-cobalt-content cathode material for Li-ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Maldivian paths for economic development have historically been
   constrained by the morphology of atoll islands and the availability of
   material resources. These constraints are most evident when examining
   the development of Male', the Maldives' capital and most populous
   island. Before the 1970s, Male' was a rather typical atoll island,
   consisting of accumulated rubble and sand with an underlying lagoonal
   reef (faro) structure. Rising population and standard-of-living
   expectations in Male' led to accelerated coral mining of Male's reefs in
   the 1970s and 80s for both landfill and construction material, extending
   the island's land surface across Male's lagoon and reef flats, close to
   the edge of its underlying faro. This combination of mining and fill
   degraded the island's natural defenses against wave events, resulting in
   disastrous floods in April 1987 and the fortification of the coastline
   with seawalls shortly thereafter. The degree of degradation to natural
   defenses and amount of investment in urban building stock have jointly
   locked Male' into a hard path for coastal resilience engineering, and
   both the damage patterns and response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami
   demonstrate that the Male' model of development and degradation has
   spread to smaller Maldivian islands. While hard measures have proven
   successful in preventing further damage, their expense has led to
   greater interest in soft path, ecosystem-based resilience measures. The
   degree of local ecosystem damage, combined with high vulnerability to
   climate change and Male's continued growth, means that such measures can
   only be seen as supplements to heavier fortification in the future,
   including raised (Th. Vilufushi) or artificial islands (Hulhumale'). The
   intersecting role hydrological stress on Maldivian groundwater has
   played in Male's development path is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the effects on spontaneous
   beating rate of mouse atrial preparations following selective block of
   cardiac ``funny{''} (f) channels, I(f), and/or suppression of
   sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function in the absence and presence of
   beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. ZD7288 {[}to block I(f)] caused a
   substantial reduction (222 +/- 13 bpm) in beating rate from 431 +/- 14
   to 209 +/- 14 bpm, ryanodine alone (to block SR Ca2+ release) reduced
   beating rate by 105 +/- 11 bpm, with subsequent addition of ZD7288
   further reducing rate by 57 +/- 9 bpm. Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) alone
   (to inhibit Ca2+ reuptake by the SR) reduced beating rate by 148 +/- 13
   bpm with subsequent addition of ZD7288 further reducing rate by 79 +/-
   12 bpm. In additional experiments measuring Ca2+ transients in the SA
   node region using Rhod-2, effects of ivabradine and ZD7288 on rate were
   again substantially reduced after CPA. Effects of CPA alone on rate
   developed much more slowly than effects on Ca2+ transient amplitude.
   ZD7288, ivabradine, and CPA reduced the slope and maximum response of
   the log(concentration)-response curves for effects of isoprenaline on
   beating rate. Very little response to isoprenaline remained after
   treatment with CPA followed by ZD7288. Similar changes in isoprenaline
   log(concentration)-response curves were seen in guinea pig preparations.
   These observations are consistent with a role for Ca2+ released from the
   SR in regulating I(f) and therefore beating rate of SA node
   preparations; there appear to be additional contributions of SR-derived
   Ca2+ to effects of b-adrenoceptor stimulation on beating rate that are
   independent of I(f).}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We investigated the influence of different Ag additions (up to 10 wt\%)
   on the superconducting properties of FeSe0.94. The structural
   investigations (XRD and SEM) indicated that Ag is present in three
   different forms. Ag at grain boundaries supports the excellent
   intergrain connections and reduces Delta T to values smaller than 1 K at
   B = 0 and Delta T <= 2.74 K at B = 14 T. Ag insertion in the crystal
   lattice unit cell provides additional carriers and changes the
   electron-hole imbalance in FeSe0.94. This results in an increase in the
   magnetoresistive effect (MR) and critical temperature (T-c). Reacted Ag
   forms a small amount (similar to 1\%) of Ag2Se impurity phase, which may
   increase the pinning energy in comparison with that of the undoped
   sample. The enhanced upper critical field (B-c2) is also a result of the
   increased impurity scattering. Thus, unlike cuprates, Ag addition
   enhances the T-c, B-c2, pinning energy and MR making the properties of
   polycrystalline FeSe0.94 similar to those of single crystals.}},

Abstract = {{Conditions for thermonuclear burn-up of an equimolar mixture of
   deuterium-tritium in non-equilibrium plasma have been investigated by
   four temperature theory. The photon distribution shape significantly
   affects the nature of thermonuclear burn. In three temperature model,
   the photon distribution is Planckian but in four temperature theory the
   photon distribution has a pure Planck form below a certain cut-off
   energy and then for photon energy above this cut-off energy makes a
   transition to Bose-Einstein distribution with a finite chemical
   potential. The objective was to develop four temperature theory in a
   plasma to calculate the critical burn up parameter which depends upon
   initial density, the plasma components initial temperatures, and hot
   spot size. All the obtained results from four temperature theory model
   are compared with 3 temperature model. It is shown that the values of
   critical burn-up parameter calculated by four temperature theory are
   smaller than those of three temperature model. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{The manufacturing of hydraulic turbine runners designed for experimental
   research on the model is carried out, usually, by precision casting or

   manufacturing times and high production costs, which are generated by
   the complex geometry and the small dimensions of the runner. Rapid
   prototyping technologies allow the manufacturing of mechanical
   components at a high precision and for a significantly lower
   manufacturing time and production costs compared to the conventional
   technologies. The use of components made of polymers, through rapid
   prototyping, in experimental research, may be limited by the properties
   of the polymer and the mechanical stress occurred. In order to verify
   the possibility of using polymers in the manufacture of turbine
   component models, a Pelton runner was made through rapid prototyping.
   The stress-strain state that occurs on the runner blade was analyzed and
   experimental investigations were performed on a micro-turbine equipped

Abstract = {{When employers hire a new staff member, the selection process is heavily
   characterised by uncertainty as the actual productivity of employees can
   only be estimated in advance. In particular, this affects the recruiting
   of entrants. In this respect, the article would like to tackle the
   question of which criteria the decision makers in companies take into
   consideration when recruiting university graduates. The assumption can
   be made based on human capital and signal theoretical considerations,
   that the applicant's individual skills are a deciding factor. Against
   the background of changing university structures in Germany that are
   particularly apparent with the new Bachelor and Master study courses and
   degrees, it will also be investigated whether the reputation of
   universities as a signal can also be included in the selection process
   to reduce the level of uncertainty. The investigation of the question
   took place with a factorial survey. The findings show that the
   applicant's individual qualifications have a decisive influence over the
   chances of success: Employers consider the final grades in their
   decision, although not in such an extent as with other individual
   criteria. In this way, practical experience in particular raises the
   likelihood of being invited to a job interview. Experience abroad and
   voluntary work also improve the chances of success. In this process, the
   reputation of the university is of almost no importance.}},

Abstract = {{Sprouts have been implicated in several outbreaks of salmonellosis in
   the United States, where the seeds are thought to be the primary source
   of contamination. The objectives of this study were to investigate the
   influence of growth temperatures of Salmonella and storage temperatures
   of alfalfa seeds on heat inactivation of the pathogen on seeds. Alfalfa
   seeds were inoculated with a composite of Salmonella, grown at
   temperatures of 15, 25, 35 or 40C, stored at 22C for 7 days, dry heated
   at 65C for up to 48 h, chilled and subsequently microbiologically
   analyzed. The heat resistance of Salmonella at 65C (D-65) varied with
   the growth temperatures in the order of 15C > 25C > 35C > 40C. The
   effect of storage temperature of seeds on heat inactivation of
   Salmonella was subsequently investigated. Inoculated seeds were dried,
   stored for 7 days at different temperatures (22, 15, 10, 4, 0, -10 or
   -18C) and then heat-treated at 60, 65 or 70C. Heat inactivation of
   Salmonella was dependent on the storage temperature and increased in the
   order of 0C approximate to -18C > 4C > 10C approximate to -10C > 15C >
   22C. Storage at -18 or 0C followed by dry heating at 60 for 72 h
   consistently inactivated the pathogen to below detectable levels (<0.7
   log cfu/g) and did not significantly (P > 0.05) reduce the sprouting
   yield of seeds compared to their untreated counterparts. These
   observations will be useful when developing effective strategies and
   practices to enhance the microbiological safety of alfalfa sprouts.}},

Abstract = {{The timing and pace of pubertal development has been associated with
   psychosocial functioning, with pubertal variables represented both as
   predictors (e.g., earlier puberty linked with poor outcomes) and as
   sequelae (e.g., early stress linked with earlier puberty). However, the
   literature has largely not tested mediational models or prospective
   mechanisms of associations between puberty and psychosocial variables.
   In a longitudinal study including 454 youth followed over four
   timepoints (mean ages 10-18), structural equation modeling tested a
   hypothesized path from childhood maltreatment to cortisol (Time 1) to
   pubertal stage (Time 2), and psychosocial outcomes (Times 3 and 4).
   There was not support for the full hypothesized pathway in either
   gender. However, for boys, maltreatment was associated with attenuated
   cortisol, and more pubertal change predicted subsequent delinquency. For
   girls, cortisol predicted more pubertal change which then predicted
   substance use. This study demonstrates links between HPA axis function,
   pubertal development, and risky outcomes. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Left untreated, inhalation anthrax is usually fatal. Vegetative forms of
   Bacillus anthracis survive in blood and tissues during infection due to
   elaboration of a protective poly-gamma-D-glutamic acid (PDGA) capsule
   that permits uncontrolled bacterial growth in vivo, eventually leading
   to overwhelming bacillosis and death. As a measure to counter threats
   from multidrug-resistant strains, we are evaluating the prophylactic and
   therapeutic potential of the PDGA depolymerase EnvD, a stable and potent
   enzyme which rapidly and selectively removes the capsule from the
   surface of vegetative cells. Repeated intravenous administration of 10
   mg/kg recombinant EnvD (rEnvD) to mice infected with lethal doses of B.
   anthracis Ames spores by inhalation prevented the emergence of symptoms
   of anthrax and death; all animals survived the 5-day treatment period,
   and 70\% survived to the end of the 14-day observation period. In
   contrast to results in sham-treated animals, the lungs and spleen of
   rEnvD-dosed animals were free of gross pathological changes. We conclude
   that rEnvD has potential as an agent to prevent the emergence of
   inhalation anthrax in infected animals and is likely to be effective
   against drug-resistant forms of the pathogen.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The phylogeny and historical biogeography of the Caucasian land snail
   genus Circassina was reconstructed using multilocus amplified fragment
   length polymorphism (AFLP) data and mitochondria( DNA sequences.
   Diversification within the group started with a divergence of
   populations from the western Lesser Caucasus from those of the Greater
   Caucasus during the late Miocene. Distinct AFLP clusters and major
   mitochondrial clades separated by long internal branches lend evidence
   to the hypothesis of separate glacial refuges in the Lesser and Greater
   Caucasus during the Pleistocene. High genetic distances across low
   geographic distances and admixture analysis revealed a phylogeographic
   boundary running through the Colchis lowlands, which may have been
   established and maintained in part by repeated transgressions of the
   Black Sea during the Pleistocene and Holocene. Localities in Ciscaucasia
   were probably colonised through long-distance dispersal across the main
   ridge of the Greater Caucasus. The phylogeny implies multiple
   independent losses of accessory genital organs, i.e. dart sac and mucus
   glands, within Circassina. None of the anatomically defined (sub-)
   species distinguished so far is monophyletic and there is gene flow
   between the two main population groups across the Colchis lowlands.
   Thus, we propose to classify these population groups as subspecies of a
   single species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   hypothesis}},
Journal = {{HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{42-72}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Mass-inertia loads on muscles change with posture and with changing
   mechanical interactions between the body and the environment. The
   nervous system must anticipate changing mass-inertia loads, especially
   during fast multi-joint coordinated movements. Riemannian geometry
   provides a mathematical framework for movement planning that takes these
   inertial interactions into account. To demonstrate this we introduce the
   controlled (vs. biomechanical) degrees of freedom of the body as the
   coordinate system for a configuration space with movements represented
   as trajectories. This space is not Euclidean. It is endowed at each
   point with a metric equal to the mass-inertia matrix of the body in that
   configuration. This warps the space to become Riemannian with curvature
   at each point determined by the differentials of the mass-inertia at
   that point. This curvature takes nonlinear mass-inertia interactions
   into account with lengths, velocities, accelerations and directions of
   movement trajectories all differing from those in Euclidean space. For
   newcomers to Riemannian geometry we develop the intuitive groundwork for
   a Riemannian field theory of human movement encompassing the entire body
   moving in gravity and in mechanical interaction with the environment. In
   particular we present a geodesic synergy hypothesis concerning planning
   of multi-joint coordinated movements to achieve goals with minimal
   muscular effort. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The incentive regulation of costs related to physical and cyber security
   in electricity networks is an important but relatively unexplored and
   ambiguous issue. These costs can be part of cost efficiency benchmarking
   or, alternatively, dealt with separately. This paper discusses the
   issues and proposes options for incorporating network security costs
   within incentive regulation in a benchmarking framework. The relevant
   concerns and limitations associated with the accounting and
   classification of network security costs, choice of cost drivers, data
   adequacy and quality and the relevant benchmarking methodologies are
   discussed. The analysis suggests that the present regulatory treatment
   of network security costs using benchmarking is limited to being an
   informative regulatory tool rather than being deterministic. We discuss
   how alternative approaches outside the benchmarking framework, such as
   the use of stochastic cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness
   analysis of network security investments can complement the results

Abstract = {{Many medical image processing techniques rely on accurate shape modeling
   of anatomical features. The presence of shape abnormalities challenges
   traditional processing algorithms based on strong morphological priors.
   In this work, a sparse shape reconstruction from a statistical shape
   model is presented. It combines the advantages of traditional
   statistical shape models (defining a `normal' shape space) and
   previously presented sparse shape composition (providing localized
   descriptors of anomalies). The algorithm was incorporated into our image
   segmentation and classification software. Evaluation was performed on
   simulated and clinical MRI data from 22 sciatica patients with
   intervertebral disc herniation, containing 35 herniated and 97 normal
   discs. Moderate to high correlation (R=0.73) was achieved between
   simulated and detected herniations. The sparse reconstruction provided
   novel quantitative features describing the herniation morphology and MRI
   signal appearance in three dimensions (3D). The proposed descriptors of
   local disc morphology resulted to the 3D segmentation accuracy of 1.07
   +/- 1.00 mm (mean absolute vertex-to-vertex mesh distance over the
   posterior disc region), and improved the intervertebral disc
   classification from 0.888 to 0.931 (area under receiver operating
   curve). The results show that the sparse shape reconstruction may
   improve computer-aided diagnosis of pathological conditions presenting
   local morphological alterations, as seen in intervertebral disc
   herniation. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In operant conditioning, rats pressing levers and pigeons pecking keys
   depend on contingent food reinforcement. Food reward agrees with
   Skinner's behaviorism, undergraduate textbooks, and folk psychology.
   However, nearly a century of experimental evidence shows, instead, that
   food in an operant conditioning chamber acts forward to evoke
   species-specific feeding behavior rather than backward to reinforce
   experimenter-defined responses. Furthermore, recent findings in
   neuroscience show consistently that intracranial stimulation to reward
   centers and dopamine release, the proposed reward molecule, also act
   forward to evoke inborn species-specific behavior. These results
   challenge longstanding views of hedonic learning and must be
   incorporated into contemporary learning theory.}},

Abstract = {{We used the Affymetrix(R) Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 to identify
   heterospecific markers and compare copy number and structural genomic
   variation between humans and rhesus macaques. Over 200,000 human copy
   number variation (CNV) probes were mapped to a Chinese and an Indian
   rhesus macaque sample. Observed genomic rearrangements and synteny were
   in agreement with the results of a previously published genomic
   comparison between humans and rhesus macaques. Comparisons between each
   of the two rhesus macaques and humans yielded 206 regions with copy
   numbers that differed by at least two fold in the Indian rhesus macaque
   and human, 32 in the Chinese rhesus macaque and human, and 147 in both
   rhesus macaques. The detailed genomic map and preliminary CNV data are
   useful for better understanding genetic variation in rhesus macaques,
   identifying derived changes in human CNVs that may have evolved by
   selection, and determining the suitability of rhesus macaques as human
   models for particular biomedical studies. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{In this brief, we numerically demonstrate a photonic delay-based
   reservoir computing system, which processes, in parallel, two
   independent computational tasks even when the two tasks have unrelated
   input streams. Our approach is based on a single-longitudinal mode
   semiconductor ring laser (SRL) with optical feedback. The SRL emits in
   two directional optical modes. Each directional mode processes one
   individual task to mitigate possible crosstalk. We illustrate the
   feasibility of our scheme by analyzing the performance on two benchmark
   tasks: 1) chaotic time series prediction and 2) nonlinear channel
   equalization. We identify some feedback configurations for which the
   results for simultaneous prediction/classification indicate a good
   performance, but with slight degradation (as compared with the
   performance obtained for single task processing) due to nonlinear and
   linear interactions between the two directional modes of the laser. In
   these configurations, the system performs well on both tasks for a broad
   range of the parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Complex visual data contain discriminative structures that are difficult
   to be fully captured by any single feature descriptor. While recent work
   on domain adaptation focuses on adapting a single hand-crafted feature,
   it is important to perform adaptation of a hierarchy of features to
   exploit the richness of visual data. We propose a novel framework for
   domain adaptation using a sparse and hierarchical network (DASH-N). Our
   method jointly learns a hierarchy of features together with
   transformations that rectify the mismatch between different domains. The
   building block of DASH-N is the latent sparse representation. It employs
   a dimensionality reduction step that can prevent the data dimension from
   increasing too fast as one traverses deeper into the hierarchy. The
   experimental results show that our method compares favorably with the
   competing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, it is shown that a
   multi-layer DASH-N performs better than a single-layer DASH-N.}},

Abstract = {{OSCP1/NOR1 (organic solute carrier partner 1/oxidored
   nitrodomain-containing protein 1) is a known tumor suppressor protein.
   OSCP1 has been reported to mediate transport of various organic solutes
   into cells; however, its role during development has not yet been
   addressed. Here we report the results of studies on dOSCP1 (the
   Drosophila ortholog of hOSCP1) to elucidate the role of OSCP1/NOR1
   during development. Knockdown of dOSCP1 in the eye imaginal discs
   induced a rough-eye phenotype in adult flies. This phenotype resulted
   from induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis followed by a compensatory
   cell proliferation and generation of reactive oxygen species in eye
   imaginal discs. The induction of apoptosis appears to be associated with
   down-regulation of the antiapoptotic Buffy gene and up-regulation of the
   pro-apoptotic Debcl gene. These effects of knockdown of dOSCP1 lead to
   mitochondrial fragmentation, degradation, and a shortfall in ATP
   production. We also found that knockdown of dOSCP1 causes a defect in
   cone cell and pigment cell differentiation in pupal retinae. Moreover,
   mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor pathway-related genes,
   such as Spitz and Drk, enhanced the rough-eye phenotype induced by
   dOSCP1 knockdown. These results suggest that dOSCP1 positively regulates
   the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway. Overall, our
   findings indicate that dOSCP1 plays multiple roles during eye
   development in Drosophila.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Background: As an important member of the steroid nuclear receptor
   family, recent research has suggested that PXR may play important roles
   in the development of multiple cancers. However, no well-designed
   studies has been conducted to investigate the associations between
   genetic polymorphisms of PXR and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in Chinese
   populations.
   Materials and methods: We performed a hospital-based case-control
   analysis to assess two genetic polymorphisms in the 3'-untranslated
   regions (3'-UTR) via allele-specific MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry assay
   and evaluated the associations between two polymorphisms and risk of
   CRC.
   Results: The PXR rs3814058C>T polymorphism was significantly associated
   with a higher risk of CRC (P < 10-3), and the CT/TT variant genotypes
   had an increased CRC risk (adjusted odds ratio = 1.54, 95\% confidence
   interval = 1.27-1.83) comparing CC genotype. In stratified analyses,
   rs3814058CT + TT genotypes was associated with increased risk among
   alcohol consumers (P=0.002). In vitro experiments indicated that the
   rs3814058C to rs3814058T transition gained a new binding of the microRNA
   hsa-miR-129-5p and decreased the PXR expression.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that the functional polymorphism
   rs3814058C>T in 3'-UTR of PXR may be a functional biomarker to predict
   risk of CRC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tonsillar metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is rare, while
   anti-Hu antibodies are frequently found in SCLC.
   A 66-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with painful dysesthesia
   and muscle weakness in the distal extremities for over 1 year,
   progressive dysphagia for over 1 month, and severe cough and dyspnea for
   over 1 week. He was diagnosed with SCLC accompanied by tonsillar
   metastasis and anti-Hu antibody-associated paraneoplastic sensory
   neuropathy (PSN). The patient tolerated 6 cycles of sequential
   chemoradiotherapy and gradually recovered. The patient's disease
   remained in remission 2 years after the diagnosis with a remarkable
   reduction of tumor burden and a persisting high titer of anti-Hu
   antibodies. To our knowledge, this is the first case of tonsillar
   metastatic SCLC accompanied by anti-Hu antibody-associated PSN, whereby
   the anticancer immune response was presumed to play a vital role in
   disease control.
   Unilateral tonsillar metastasis of SCLC accompanied by anti-Hu
   antibody-associated PSN can occur and in certain circumstances, may have
   a favorable prognosis.}},

Abstract = {{To safely and effectively apply artemisinin sustained-release granules
   to control and prevent algal water-blooms, the effects of artemisinin
   and its sustained-release granules on freshwater alga (Scenedesmus

   well as the production and release of microcystins (MCs) were studied.
   The results showed that artemisinin sustained-release granules inhibited
   the growth of M. aeruginosa (above 95 \% IR) and S. obliquus (about 90
   \% IR), with M. aeruginosa more sensitive. The artemisinin
   sustained-release granules had a longer inhibition effect on growth of
   pure algae and algal coexistence than direct artemisinin dosing. The
   artemisinin sustained-release granules could decrease the production and
   release of algal toxins due to the continued stress of artemisinin
   released from artemisinin sustained-release granules. There was no
   increase in the total amount of MC-LR in the algal cell culture medium.}},

Abstract = {{AimTo investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1\%
   trypsin and 1\% proteinase K in combination with 2\% chlorhexidine (with
   or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic
   multispecies model biofilm.
   MethodologyNutrient-stressed biofilms (Propionibacterium acnes,
   Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces radicidentis, Streptococcus
   mitis and Enterococcus faecalis OMGS 3202) were grown in prepared root
   canals of single-rooted teeth. The treatment groups included 1\% trypsin
   and 2\% chlorhexidine (CHX), 1\% proteinase K and 2\% CHX (with and
   without ultrasonics). 2\% CHX was the positive control and untreated
   group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the
   negative control. The biofilms were investigated using confocal laser
   scanning microscopy (CLSM) with live/dead staining and quantitative
   microbial culture.
   ResultsThe trypsin and CHX group with ultrasonics was significantly more
   effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than
   those of all other groups (P<0.05). The viable counts of the proteinase
   K and CHX group used with (4.260.58 log(10)cfumL(-1)) or without
   ultrasonics (5.05 +/- 1.36 log(10)cfumL(-1)) were significantly reduced
   (P<0.05) as compared with the untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84
   log(10)cfumL(-1)) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73
   log(10)cfumL(-1)) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10
   log(10)cfumL(-1)). The CHX group was less effective in biofilm
   disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and
   proteinase K.
   ConclusionThe trypsin and CHX group with ultrasonics was significantly
   more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting
   biofilm.}},

Title = {{Character and provenance of aeolian sediments in northeast Thailand}},
Journal = {{AEOLIAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{5-14}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aeolian activity is not generally associated with the humid tropics, and
   although reports of loess-like soils in various locations in southeast
   Asia exist, these mainly lack the detailed analysis to set them in
   meaningful spatial or historical context. This paper examines the red
   and yellow sandy sediments of the Khorat Plateau in northeast Thailand
   which have been variously referred to as `cover sands', `loessial soils'
   or `loess'. The sediments are referred to as having alluvial, biological
   as well as aeolian origin, and a date of 9-35 ka is reported. The study
   compares the Khorat sediments physically and geochemically with loess
   and aeolian sediments from other regions, as well as with other sites in
   southeast Asia which are reported here. The moderate degree of particle
   sorting and unimodal sizes of the sediments along with a sub-spherical
   sub-rounded form, supports previous diagnoses of an aeolian origin.
   Geochemical analysis of the Khorat sediments indicates severe depletion
   in both mobile and immobile elements, which are even more depleted than
   other southeast Asian loessic soils examined. This depletion, along with
   the only moderate particle sorting, suggests the source of the sediments
   to be the local weathered sandstones outcropping around the edge of the
   Khorat Plateau. The dissimilarity of the Khorat sediments from Upper
   Continental Crust (UCC) elemental values supports this, as
   homogenisation would occur if diverse source areas were involved. The
   study suggests that aeolian sediments of humid tropical regions warrant
   more attention as climate proxy markers, due to the dissimilarity
   between the present climate and conditions required for their formation.

Abstract = {{Overexpression of insulin growth factor 2 (IGF2) is a hallmark of
   adrenocortical carcinomas and pheochromocytomas. Previous studies
   investigating the IGF2/H19 locus have mainly focused on a single
   molecular level such as genomic alterations or altered DNA methylation
   levels and the causal changes underlying IGF2 overexpression are still
   not fully established. In the current study, we analyzed 62 tumors of
   the adrenal gland from patients with Conn's adenoma (CA, n=12),
   pheochromocytomas (PCC, n=10), adrenocortical benign tumors (ACBT,
   n=20), and adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC, n=20). Gene expression,
   somatic copy number variation of chr11p15.5, and DNA methylation status
   of three differential methylated regions of the IGF2/H19 locus including
   the H19 imprinting control region were integratively analyzed. IGF2
   overexpression was found in 85\% of the ACCs and 100\% of the PCCs
   compared to 23\% observed in CAs and ACBTs. Copy number aberrations of
   chr11p15.5 were abundant in both PCCs and ACCs but while PCCs retained a
   diploid state, ACCs were frequently tetraploid (7/19). Loss of either a
   single allele or loss of two alleles of the same parental origin in
   tetraploid samples resulted in a uniparental disomy-like genotype. These
   copy number changes correlated with hypermethylation of the H19 ICR
   suggesting that the lost alleles were the unmethylated maternal alleles.
   Our data provide conclusive evidence that loss of the maternal allele
   correlates with IGF2 overexpression in adrenal tumors and that
   hypermethylation of the H19 ICR is a consequence thereof.}},

Abstract = {{With a quadrupling of forensic psychiatric patients in Denmark over the
   past 20 years, focus on violence risk assessment practices across the
   country has increased. However, information is lacking regarding Danish
   risk assessment practice across professional disciplines and clinical
   settings; little is known about how violence risk assessments are
   conducted, which instruments are used for what purposes, and how mental
   health professionals rate their utility and costs. As part of a global
   survey exploring the application of violence risk assessment across 44
   countries, the current study investigated Danish practice across several
   professional disciplines and settings in which forensic and high-risk
   mental health patients are assessed and treated. In total, 125 mental
   health professionals across the country completed the survey. The five
   instruments that respondents reported most commonly using for risk
   assessment, risk management planning and risk monitoring were Broset,
   HCR-20, the START, the PCL-R, and the PCL: SV. Whereas the HCR-20 was
   rated highest in usefulness for risk assessment, the START was rated
   most useful for risk management and risk monitoring. No significant
   differences in utility were observed across professional groups.
   Unstructured clinical judgments were reported to be faster but more
   expensive to conduct than using a risk assessment instrument.
   Implications for clinical practice are discussed.}},

Journal = {{COASTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{1-3}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The morphological time scale for the response of outer bar crest level
   to tidal water-level changes is found to be remarkably short, namely
   around 15 min for near-prototype wave heights and depths and regular
   waves. This corresponds to the bar crest level range being 0.77 times
   the tidal range with a time-lag of only 15 min. Only one near-prototype
   scale experiment with tide and sufficient time resolution is known to
   the writers, namely Kraus \& Larson (1988) Case 911, which had h(max) =
   4.4 m, d(50) = 0.4 mm, a semidiurnal tide range of ca 1 m and regular
   waves with H = 1.34 m, T = 7.9 s. However, the fast crest-level response
   is also seen in profile development studies without tide, i.e., the bar
   crest level generally gets close to its final value in an hour or so
   while the overall profile adjustment (e.g. seaward bar migration)
   continues for tens of hours. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{For decades, various research argued that the father's role was that of
   economic provider and support of your partner. However, with the
   historical changes that were happening in recent decades, many
   psychologists were interested in knowing what the roles of the father
   were and that happened to the father during the pregnancy of her son.
   That is why this study aimed to construct an instrument to learn,
   evaluate and analyze how the father felt regarding the arrival of his
   son, and also know the various emotions presented in each stage of
   pregnancy. One concludes that the father from early pregnancy through a
   process of construction to parenthood, unlike investigations suggest
   that the father realizes his recent paternity when he first sees her
   son, was found to father begins its transition from the decision to have
   a child. And the way how this transition takes place will depend on
   various factors such as: the story as a child, his relationship with his

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{SI}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Due to the growing demand on more accurate prediction of biophysical
   properties (e.g., leaf area index) or carbon balance models based on
   remotely sensed data, the understory effect needs to be separated from
   the overstory. Reflectance models can provide possibility to model and
   retrieve understory reflectance over large scales, but ground truth data
   is needed to validate such models and algorithms. In this study, we
   documented the seasonal variation (April-September) and spectral changes
   occurring in understory layers of a typical European hemi-boreal forest.
   The understory composition was recorded and its spectra measured with an
   ASD FieldSpec Hand-Held UV/VNIR Spectroradiometer eight times at four
   site types during the growing period (from May to September) in 2013.
   The collected dataset presented within this study would be of much use
   to improve and validate algorithms or models for extracting spectral
   properties of understory from remote sensing data. It can be also
   further used as a valuable input in radiative transfer simulations that
   are used to quantify the roles of forest tree layer and understory

Abstract = {{Though both the Mathieu and incised urethral plate techniques are
   individually described for single-stage repair of distal penile
   hypospadias, each has its own shortcomings. We describe the combination
   of the two techniques by taking their advantages and reducing their
   limitations. Thirteen patients belonging to the age group of 3-22 years
   with distal penile hypospadias and mild chordee were operated by this
   technique with a mean follow-up of 8 months. One patient had
   urethrocutaneous fistula, and another patient had partial skin necrosis
   which healed spontaneously without fistula. Both of these complications
   occurred in adult patients. None developed urethral stenosis, and the
   cosmesis of the glans was excellent in all cases. This technique is very
   helpful in patients having small flat glans and shallow urethral groove.}},

Abstract = {{Terai region of northern India is having great potentiality for growing
   low chilling cultivars of different temperate fruits as this region
   receives sufficient amount of low temperature every year. However, the
   major problems of low chill cultivars are small fruit size, along with
   poor physico-chemical quality attributes. The present investigation was
   aimed at addressing these problems. For determining the influence of
   plant bio-regulators CPPU (5 and 10 ppm), NAA (10 and 20 ppm) and
   salicylic acid (50 and 100 ppm) were applied as once, twice and thrice
   spray at fortnightly interval after fruit set. CPPU @ 10 ppm was found
   most effective for increasing fruit length (6.79 cm), width (6.67 cm),
   fruit weight (182.84 g) and volume (179.11 ml), while TSS (13.38 degrees
   Brix), total sugars (8.25\%), acidity (0.55\%), number of fruits per
   tree (285.00) and yield (47.66 kg) were found better with the
   application of CPPU @ 5 ppm. Higher per cent of marketable fruits

Abstract = {{This study discussed the division of matrix- and fracture-type shale
   oils in the Jiyang Depression, and proposed the concept of fracture
   development coefficient. The fracture development coefficient is defined
   as the ratio of fault throw to the distance between a shale oil well and
   the nearest fault. Based on CO2 content, state of water, oil production
   and logging response of shale oil formations, the classification of
   shale oils was established, Le., a fracture-type shale oil well has a
   fracture development coefficient greater than 0.2, while a matrix-type
   one has a fracture development coefficient less than 0.2. Furthermore,
   the key control factors of matrix- and fracture-type shale oil
   enrichment were analyzed using typical anatomical and statistical
   methods. For matrix-type shale oil enrichment, these factors are
   lithofacies, total organic carbon (TOC), shale porosity and abnormal
   pressure; for fracture-type shale oil enrichment, they are lithofacies,
   extent of fracture development, and abnormal pressure. This study also
   first described the differences between matrix- and fracture-type shale
   oils. The results provide reference for the exploration of terrestrial
   faulted basins in eastern China.}},

Abstract = {{Sternal resection is occasionally required for patients with malignant
   tumors, particularly sarcomas, in the sternal region. Few reports have
   described post-operative respiratory and shoulder function after sternal
   resection for patients with bone and soft-tissue sarcomas.
   Eight consecutive patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas requiring
   sternal resection were the focus of this study. Chest wall was
   reconstructed with a non-rigid or semi-rigid prosthesis combined, in
   most cases, with soft tissue flap reconstruction. Clinical outcomes
   investigated included complications, shoulder function, evaluated with
   Musculoskeletal Tumor Society-International Symposium of Limb Salvage
   system, and respiratory function, evaluated by use of spirometry.
   The anterior chest wall was reconstructed with non-rigid strings for 3
   patients and with polypropylene mesh for 5. There were no severe
   post-operative complications, for example surgical site infection or
   pneumonia. All 3 patients with non-rigid reconstruction experienced
   paradoxical breathing, whereas none with polypropylene mesh did so.
   Post-operatively, FEV(1)\% was unchanged but \%VC was significantly
   reduced (p = 0.01), irrespective of the reconstruction method used
   (strings or polypropylene mesh). Shoulder function was not impaired.
   Among patients undergoing sternal resection, post-operative shoulder
   function was excellent. Pulmonary function was slightly restricted, but
   not sufficiently so to interfere with the activities of daily living
   (ADL). Paradoxical breathing is a slight concern for non-rigid
   reconstruction.}},

   micrometer-size ones. The reason may be the size difference between dust
   and crystal grains. The depth of dust penetration into plasma-facing
   materials is closely related to the incident velocity, and the impacting
   angle also plays an important role. Dust and material surface damage is
   also investigated. Results show that both incident velocity and angle

Journal = {{ASIAN AND PACIFIC MIGRATION JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{432-462}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study examines health stratification in contemporary urban China in
   light of rapid internal migration and evolving socio-institutional
   arrangements in the society. Much of this has been linked to the hukou
   system or household registration system which has created a
   stratification system based on place of origin (rural or urban) and
   occupation (agricultural or non-agricultural). The research question was
   probed using a nationally representative survey. The results show that
   as a group, migrants in urban areas were healthier than urban natives,
   and residents with non-agricultural hukou were healthier than those
   having agricultural hukou. Institutional impacts on health status were
   largely indirect, as manifested partly through self-selective mechanisms
   of migration and partly through socio-economic stratification in urban
   society. Nevertheless, institutional arrangements had salient direct

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDAmmonia nitrogen affects the methane fermentation of chicken
   manure, both the process resilience and the functional microbial
   community dynamics. In this study, a mesophilic continuous stirred-tank
   reactor (CSTR) was investigated with total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) varied
   from 2000 mg L-1 to 16000 mg L-1.
   RESULTS16S-rDNA cloning and TRFLP results revealed that the microbial
   community shifts significantly responding to TAN. Aceticlastic
   Methanosarcina acetivorans increased gradually from 17\% in the steady
   stage to 72\% in the recovered stage with high resistance compared with
   aceticlastic Methanosaeta, which almost disappeared at high TAN. In
   contrast, hydrogenotrophic Methanoculleus increased from 2\% in the
   steady stage to 30\% in the inhibited stage and decreased to 13\% in the
   recovered stage. The abundances of the dominant Firmicutes were 74\% and
   92\%, with and without inhibition, and 58\% in the recovered stage.
   Bacteroidetes decreased from 17\% in the steady stage to 4\% in the
   inhibited stage and thrived to 31\% in the recovered stage.
   CONCLUSIONProcess resilience was proven even after serious inhibition.
   Recoverable shifted archaeal and chaotic shifted bacterial communities
   with functional stability were observed. This result reveals that TAN
   has an obvious effect on microbial community shifts and the functional
   resilience of the process. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{Based on fractal theory, the fractal characteristics of soil particle
   size distribution (PSD) and soil water retention curve (WRC) under the
   five vegetation types were studied in the mountainous land of Northern
   China. Results showed that: (1) the fractal parameters of soil PSD and
   soil WRC varied greatly under each different vegetation type, with
   Quercus acutissima Carr. and Robina pseudoacacia Linn. mixed plantation
   (QRM) > Pinus thunbergii Parl. and Pistacia chinensis Bunge mixed
   plantation (PPM) > Pinus thunbergii Parl. (PTP) > Juglans rigia Linn.
   (JRL) > abandoned grassland (ABG); (2) the soil fractal dimensions of
   woodlands (QRM, PPM, PTP and JRL) were significantly higher than that in
   ABG, and mixed forests (QRM and PPM) were higher than that in pure
   forests (PTP and JRL); (3) the fractal dimension of soil was positively
   correlated with the silt and clay content but negatively correlated with
   the sand content; and (4) the fractal dimension of soil PSD was
   positively correlated with the soil WRC. These indicated that the
   fractal parameters of soil PSD and soil WRC could act as quantitative
   indices to reflect the physical properties of the soil, and could be
   used to describe the influences of the Return Farmland to Forests

Journal = {{ENGINEERING ANALYSIS WITH BOUNDARY ELEMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel semi-analytical algorithm is developed to
   evaluate the nearly strong and hypersingular integrals on higher order
   elements in two dimensional (2-D) BEM. By analyzing the geometrical
   feature of higher order elements in the intrinsic coordinates, the
   relative distance from a source point to the element of integration is
   defined to describe the character of the nearly singular integrals. By a
   series of deduction, the leading singular part of the integral kernel
   functions on the higher order elements is separated from each of the
   nearly singular integrals. Then the nearly singular integrals on the
   higher order elements close to the source point are transformed to the
   sum of both the non-singular parts and nearly singular parts by the
   subtraction, in which the former are calculated by the conventional
   numerical quadratures and the latter are evaluated by the resulting
   analytical formulations.
   Furthermore, the BEM with the quadratic elements was used to analyze the
   displacements and stresses near the boundary as well as thin-walled
   structures in 2-D elasticity. The numerical results from three examples
   demonstrate that the quadratic BE analysis with the semi-analytical
   algorithm is more accurate and efficient than the Linear BE analysis
   with the analytical algorithm for the nearly singular integrals. In
   fact, the Linear BE analysis has been greatly more advantageous compared
   with the finite element analysis for the thin-walled structures. (C)

Title = {{Perceived changes to swallowing in people with Parkinson's disease}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERAPY AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aims: To describe the relationship between perceived swallowing
   difficulties in people with Parkinson's disease with disease-specific
   measures, carers' perceptions of swallowing problems and control
   participant responses.
   Method: In total, 119 people with Parkinson's disease, their carers and
   matched controls answered a specifically prepared functional swallowing
   changes questionnaire. People with Parkinson's completed a
   water-swallowing test. Motor status, cognition and mood were also
   assessed.
   Results: People with Parkinson's disease scored poorer than controls (p
   < 0.001) on the questionnaire. Those reporting swallowing problems
   scored poorer than those who did not (p < 0.01). However, of 74 people
   with Parkinson's who perceived no swallowing problem, 32 fell below the
   50th percentile on the water-swallowing test, while 41 fell below
   cut-off scores on the questionnaire. There was a weak correlation
   between drinking speeds and questionnaire totals. Carers' evaluations
   correlated with their partners' (r = 0.796) but they perceived changes
   as less severe (p < 0.03).
   Conclusions: Despite reduced swallowing efficiency, some people with
   Parkinson's can successfully compensate. A sizeable proportion, however,
   remain unaware of swallowing problems when asked simply `Do you have a
   problem?', but indicate difficulties with more specific questions. The
   present questionnaire provides a guide for gaining such insights for
   diagnosis, education and outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveNovel countermeasures to increase healthcare expenditures
   should be explored in rapidly aging societies, including Japan. Social
   support is a resource for the older people that effectively reduces
   psychological distress, with or without specialized health service
   provision. This cross-sectional study was conducted to determine whether
   home visits by commissioned welfare volunteers (organizations of
   community residents assigned by national or local governments) are
   associated with a lower risk of psychological distress among the older
   people.
   MethodsQuestionnaires were sent in August 2010 to all residents aged
   65years in three municipalities (n=21,232) in Okayama Prefecture in
   Japan; 13,929 were returned (response rate=65.6\%). The final sample
   size for the analysis was 11,312 participants. Home visits,
   psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale: K6>5), and
   severe psychological distress (K6>13) were measured by the
   questionnaire. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence
   intervals (CIs) for psychological distress, adjusting for age, gender,
   education, marital status, and qualification for long-term care
   insurance.
   ResultsThe prevalence was 41.4\% for psychological distress and 6.5\%
   for severe psychological distress among all participants. Home visits
   were significantly associated with a lower risk of psychological
   distress after adjusting for the covariates (OR: 0.71, 95\% CI:
   0.65-0.77). These associations were comparable for men and women. The
   association was clearer for severe psychological distress (OR: 0.51,
   95\% CI: 0.43-0.61).

Abstract = {{The use of direct PCR methods had been highly explored in forensics
   mainly due to reduced costs and also the reduced time spent on the
   analysis. In addition, as the use of washed FTA paper does not allow the
   quantification of DNA, the consequent increasing of PCR sensitivity
   makes this methodology more advantageous than the conventional
   extraction methods. In this study, we successfully sequenced the
   mitochondrial DNA control region from blood FTA samples with the
   elimination of the extraction step. The samples varied from one to eight
   years of storage and were assembled according to Anderson's reference
   sequence. The direct sequencing from dried blood FTA samples could be
   appropriate for the analysis of a large number of samples in a short
   time period, reducing the hands on time and also the manipulation bias.

   from natural molecules consists of integrating the DNA information and a
   simple metabolism into vesicles with the rather ambitious objective of
   obtaining a compartment capable of self-reproduction based on a minimal
   genome. The artificial cell approach consists of assembling cell-sized
   compartments capable of biological functions by integrating natural and
   synthetic molecules to construct hybrid systems with new properties.
   Those three avenues, all multidisciplinary and complementary, give rise
   to new ideas for biotechnologies and medicine.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to develop a computational model to
   simulate the dynamics of intraocular gas behavior in pneumatic
   retinopexy (PR) procedure. The presented model predicted intraocular gas
   volume at any time and determined the tolerance angle within which a
   patient can maneuver and still gas completely covers the tear(s).
   Computational fluid dynamics calculations were conducted to describe PR
   procedure. The geometrical model was constructed based on the rabbit and
   human eye dimensions. SF6 in the form of pure and diluted with air was
   considered as the injected gas. The presented results indicated that the
   composition of the injected gas affected the gas absorption rate and gas
   volume. After injection of pure SF6, the bubble expanded to 2.3 times of
   its initial volume during the first 23 h, but when diluted SF6 was used,
   no significant expansion was observed. Also, head positioning for the
   treatment of retinal tear influenced the rate of gas absorption.
   Moreover, the determined tolerance angle depended on the bubble and tear
   size. More bubble expansion and smaller retinal tear caused greater
   tolerance angle. For example, after 23 h, for the tear size of 2 mm the
   tolerance angle of using pure SF6 is 1.4 times more than that of using
   diluted SF6 with 80\% air. Composition of the injected gas and
   conditions of the tear in PR may dramatically affect the gas absorption
   rate and gas volume. Quantifying these effects helps to predict the
   tolerance angle and improve treatment efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reports on the study of the UHI phenomenon in Padua, a medium
   size city of the North-East of Italy. During the 2012-2014 period
   experimental measurements and simulations were carried out by the
   Authors in different zones of the city area: urban, sub-urban and rural.
   The analysis of the data highlights the presence of UHI effect with
   different magnitudes in function of the zone of the city, up to 7
   degrees C.
   In this study a very famous square of the city (Prato della Valle) was
   analyzed: it can be considered representative of the phenomenon because
   of the size and the very different characteristics from UHI effect point
   of view. The ENVImet simulation model was used to evaluate the effect of
   some mitigation strategies. Two scenarios besides the actual one
   ({''}AsIs'' scenario) were analyzed: ``Green ground'' (halving the
   asphalt surface and doubling the green and plants surface) and ``Cool
   Pavements'' (increasing the albedo of impervious horizontal surfaces).
   The simulations results are presented both in terms of UHI intensity and
   mean radiant temperature and thermal comfort sensation. The results are
   presented both in spatial and temporal terms for a typical summer day.
   The ``Green ground'' scenario allows till 1.4 degrees C and 3 degrees C
   decrease in air temperature, respectively during the night and the day.
   The same items for the ``Cool Pavements'' scenario are, respectively,
   1.8 and 4 degrees C. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   declined most during the first five days post-mortem (PM), while purge

   and calpastatin activity declined significantly up to five days PM,
   suggesting that they may be responsible for tenderization. Cathepsins B,
   BL and H activity increased significantly during ageing. The BF muscle
   had significantly higher pH, lower purge loss, higher cooking loss,
   higher WBSF and higher calpain and calpastatin activity than the LTL. No
   significant differences between the genders or muscles were found for

Abstract = {{Quality organization of the education system is a growing factor in
   achieving continuous economic progress. Therefore it is important to
   measure quality of education through a number of indicators of
   effectiveness. One of the indicators of quality of higher education is
   also to monitor changes in the number of enrolled and graduated students
   at higher education institutions that clearly shows whether the number
   of students who enroll and complete their studies increases or
   decreases. In a last few years Croatia is investing in increasing
   quality of higher education, partly through implementation of Bologna
   process, and partly through internal analysis of institutions of higher
   education. Investing in quality resulted with positive completion rate
   but despite that, Croatia is still behind Europe according to the share
   of highly educated. Efficiency analysis of higher education shows that
   Croatia is continuously increasing its share of highly educated but in
   order to reach the average of European Union, further efforts in
   improving educational image still represent a necessity.}},

   activity in a rat model of Gulf War Illness pain syndrome}},
Journal = {{NEUROTOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{67-79}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Following their return from deployment, Gulf War (GW) veterans reported
   widespread joint and muscle pain at rates that far exceeded those of
   soldiers returning from other conflicts. It is widely believed that
   exposure to insecticides, repellants and nerve gas prophylactics
   contributed to the symptoms of Gulf War Illness (GWI), but an animal
   model of GW pain has been elusive. In our previous work, we observed
   that 4-8 weeks exposure to pyridostigmine bromide (PB), permethrin and
   chlorpyrifos could produce persistent alterations in the physiology of
   Na(v)1.9 and K(v)7 expressed in deep tissue nociceptors of the dorsal
   root ganglion. However, behavioral assessments from these same rats were
   not consistent with a delayed pain syndrome similar to that of GWI pain.
   In the present studies, we intensified the exposure to
   anticholinesterases PB and chlorpyrifos while retaining the same
   dosages. Animals receiving the intensified protocol for 30 days
   exhibited significant increases in resting for about 8 weeks after
   exposure. Thereafter, all measures were comparable to controls. Animals
   treated with intensified anticholinesterases for 60 days exhibited
   increased resting and reduced movement 12 weeks post-exposure. In whole
   cell patch studies, muscle and vascular nociceptor K-DR and K(v)7 ion
   channels exhibited increased amplitude relative to controls (e.g.,
   normalized current and/or peak conductance) at 8 weeks post-exposures;
   however, at 12 weeks post-exposure, the amplitude of these currents was
   significantly decreased in muscle nociceptors. In current clamp studies,
   muscle nociceptors also manifested increased action potential duration,
   afterhyperpolarization and increased discharge to muscarinic agonists 12
   weeks post-exposure. The decline in activity of muscle nociceptor KDR
   and K(v)7 channel proteins was consistent with increased nociceptor
   excitability and a delayed myalgia in rats exposed to GW chemicals. (C)

Abstract = {{This study uses Miami-Dade County, Florida home sales, and Citizens
   Property Insurance Corporation data for the period 2004 through 2009 to
   measure the capitalization effect of increases in premiums on house
   prices. Using hedonic pricing models, spatial autocorrelation models,
   and difference-in-differences models, we find that new information was
   conveyed to homeowners in the higher risk areas by the 2004/2005 storms
   and that consumers appear to use the insurance premium as a ``risk
   signal.{''} We also find some support for the hypothesis that the risk
   of potential hurricane losses is communicated to potential homebuyers
   through windzone maps.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Jeune syndrome (JS) often results in lethal thoracic
   insufficiency syndrome. Since 1991, vertical expandable prosthetic
   titanium rib Dynamic PosteroLateral Expansion Thoracoplasty was used at
   our institution for treatment of JS. This study assesses the safety and
   efficacy of this procedure.
   Methods: Twenty-four JS patients were treated, 2 lost to follow-up, 17
   with a minimum of 2-year follow-up retrospectively reviewed for clinical
   course: Assisted Ventilation Rate, respiratory rate, capillary blood
   gases, pulmonary function testings, and complications. Upright
   anteroposterior/lateral radiographs were measured for Cobb angle,
   kyphosis, lordosis, thoracic width, and thoracic/lumbar spinal height.
   Computed tomography scan lung volumes were obtained in 12 patients.
   Results: Mean age at initial implant was 23 months (7 to 62 mo) with an
   average 8.4 years (2.3 to 15.6 y) of follow-up. Average chest width
   increased from 121 to 168mm at follow-up (P < 0.001). Preoperatively,
   7/17 (41\%) patients had scoliosis. The remainder developed scoliosis
   during treatment, 8 requiring additional implants. Thoracic and lumbar
   spinal height was normal preoperatively and stayed normal during
   treatment. Thoracic kyphosis/lumbar lordosis was stable. Average
   computed tomography scan total lung volumes increased 484 to 740mm(3)
   (P< 0.001), and Assisted Ventilation Rate status tended to improve (P =
   0.07). Average forced vital capacity was 34\% predicted at first test
   and 27\% predicted at last follow-up. Early demise after surgery was
   common with multisystem disease. Mean respiratory rate decreased from 35
   to 24 bpm at last follow-up (P < 0.05). Survival rate of the 22 patients
   was 68\%. Migration of the rib cradles/titanium slings occurred in 12
   patients, superficial infections in 5 patients, deep infections in 4
   patients, and wound dehiscence in 5 patients. Infection rate was 4.6\%
   per procedure.
   Conclusions: The survival rate in JS with surgery was nearly 70\%
   (compared with 70\% to 80\% mortality without treatment) with less
   ventilator dependence. Both C1 stenosis and scoliosis are common in JS.
   Spinal height in JS is normal. Complications are frequent, but tolerable
   in view of the clinical gains and increase in survival.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives The multifaceted nature of the problems faced by someone with
   motor neuron disease requires a knowledgeable multidisciplinary team
   approach. Where available, generally, such services are only provided on
   an outpatient basis, meaning that hospitalised patients are frequently
   admitted to non-specialist wards where understanding of their needs is
   limited. Little is known regarding the inpatient care received by
   patients. Our objective was to address this by exploring the experience
   of hospitalisation following a diagnosis of motor neuron disease from
   the perspective of family carers of those diagnosed with the illness.
   Method This was a qualitative secondary analysis of pre-existing data
   from two previously published, separately conducted, qualitative
   studies. The study involved interview data from 18 bereaved carers and 3
   current carers of family members diagnosed with motor neuron disease in
   Northwest England.
   Results The findings reveal dissatisfaction with the inpatient care
   received, which impacted negatively not only on patient and carer
   enthusiasm for future hospital admissions but also on carer bereavement.
   Conclusions Patients with motor neuron disease have specialist needs
   that are not always met during hospital admission, particularly to
   non-specialist units. The inpatient care provided for these patients
   must be improved as must the knowledge and understanding of the illness
   among healthcare professionals who treat them.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The notion of spirituality/religious belief is recognized
   internationally as a domain within end-of-life care and is important in
   patients' and carers' quality-of-life. When faced with incurable
   illness, patients often become more philosophical about their life; many
   seek comfort in spiritual or religious philosophies. Our intention was
   to understand how personal spirituality and religious faith might help
   those living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease
   (ALS/MND) cope with their impending death.
   Method: Unsolicited narratives (internet and print-published) written by
   individuals diagnosed with the terminal condition of ALS/MND were
   analyzed thematically. Narratives from 161 individuals diagnosed with
   ALS/MND written over a period of 37 years (from 1968 to 2005) were
   included.
   Results: Our findings reveal that religious faith sustains and helps
   people to avoid despair, and personal spirituality helps them make sense
   of what is happening to them.
   Significance of Results: The use of personal narratives by people with
   ALS/MND has provided a vehicle for sharing their deepest spiritual and
   religious thoughts with others. The place of spirituality and religious
   faith within ALS/MND care should not be underestimated. Assessment of
   religious or spiritual needs should become a routine part of practice
   and is the responsibility of all members of the multidisciplinary team.}},

Abstract = {{Occupant behaviour represents one of the greatest sources of uncertainty
   in building energy use. Energy use uncertainty is an undesirable trait
   with regards to sizing equipment and estimating energy use and cost.
   This paper presents one approach to help address this uncertainty: use
   of passive building measures to minimize the occurrence of discomfort so
   that occupants do not have to adapt as frequently in potentially
   energy-intensive ways. A robust design method is proposed whereby
   occupant behaviour models are embedded in building performance
   simulation to test different building designs for their probabilistic
   energy use and adaptive actions. To demonstrate the method, the
   daylighting and solar shading domain is explored. The results indicate
   one possible approach to reducing the impact of occupant behaviour in
   buildings. However, the study also shows the need for more occupant
   monitoring and modelling research as well as more empirical evidence to
   validate robust design strategies.}},

Title = {{Is driver licensing restriction for age-related medical conditions an
   effective mechanism to improve driver safety without unduly impairing
   mobility?}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN GERIATRIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{541-544}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: While medical conditions have been recognised as a minor
   contributing factor to road traffic crashes, clinicians and driver
   licencing agencies need mechanisms for promoting safe mobility for those
   with age-related illnesses which can impact on driving safety.
   Restrictive licensing has been proposed as a possible intervention for
   decreasing the risk of crashes associated with medical crashes, whilst
   not unduly affecting patient mobility.
   Objective: To analyse how the term ``restrictive licensing{''} is
   defined in the literature, and to determine the effectiveness of this
   mechanism in improving driver safety.
   Design: A systematic literature review.
   Methods: A search of the Medline and TRID databases.
   Results: Restrictive licensing is most commonly defined as a
   geographical, time of day or speed restriction placed on the driver.
   Personal and vehicle modifications are considered by some to also be a
   form of restrictive licensing. Existing studies,are supportive of the
   efficacy of restrictive licensing programs, with reduced crash rates for
   drivers carrying restricted licences compared to controls.
   Conclusion: Restrictive licensing has been shown to be an effective
   mechanism of increasing driver safety without unduly impacting driver
   mobility. It has significant potential to have a positive impact on the
   ability of those with medical conditions to drive safely. Further
   research is needed to determine the optimum format and policies for
   advising driver restrictions for age-related disease and disability. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the issues facing Philippine Airlines in its ever
   evolving and changing landscape in the domestic, regional and
   international markets. The Philippine aviation industry had its safety
   status downgraded to Category 2 for six years by the International Civil
   Aviation Organization and the US Federal Aviation Administration. This
   downgrading of the status severely limited Philippine Airlines from
   expanding internationally, but its reinstatement provides huge
   opportunities for the incumbent. However, in the domestic and regional
   markets it faces a threat from rapidly encroaching low-cost carriers.
   The Philippines has the highest domestic low-cost carrier penetration
   rate in the world, while the incumbent has rebranded its low-cost
   subsidiary, AirPhil, to a full-service carrier, PAL Express, which has
   impacted its ability to compete in short-haul markets. Philippine
   Airlines' new routes to the Middle East and Europe have the potential to
   be profitable, but their success is hampered by the lack of domestic
   connectivity and no feeder traffic from partner airlines.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{182-188}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Silicone polymers are used for a wide array of applications from passive
   samplers in environmental studies, to implants used in human
   augmentation and reconstruction. If silicone sequesters toxicants
   throughout implantation, it may represent a history of exposure and
   potentially reduce the body burden of toxicants influencing the risk of
   adverse health outcomes such as breast cancer. Objectives of this
   research included identifying a wide variety of toxicants in human
   silicone implants, and measuring the in vivo absorption of contaminants
   into silicone and surrounding tissue in an animal model. In the first
   study, eight human breast implants were analyzed for over 1400 organic
   contaminants including consumer products, chemicals in commerce, and
   pesticides. A total of 14 compounds including pesticides such as
   trans-nonachlor (1.2-5.9 ng/g) and p,p'-DDE (1.2-34 ng/g) were
   identified in human implants, 13 of which have not been previously
   reported in silicone prostheses. In the second project, female ICR mice
   were implanted with silicone and dosed with p,p'-DDE and PCB118 by
   intraperitoneal injection. After nine days, silicone and adipose samples
   were collected, and all implants in dosed mice had p,p'-DDE and P0118

Abstract = {{ObjectiveAustralian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people suffer
   health inequities, such as high levels of psychological distress and
   multiple life stressors. These have been shaped by colonisation, racism,
   discrimination, and government policies and practices.
   MethodEight Australian psychologists were interviewed with the aim of
   identifying the professional skills and personal competencies that
   enable effective service delivery for this client group, and especially
   those aged 12-25 (i.e., youth).
   ResultsThematic analysis identified that personal and clinical
   credibility, relationship centrism, contextual understanding, a holistic
   approach, and flexibility are important to good practice. Not all of
   these are currently part of standard psychology training, but many are
   covered by guidelines developed by the Australian Psychological Society.
   ConclusionsResults from this study indicate that ongoing adjustments to
   university curricula, professional competency requirements for
   practitioner registration, and continuing professional development will
   all contribute to best practice. Moreover, for Australian psychologists,
   the consolidation of cultural competency into a useful framework for
   professional development is paramount.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Evaluation of scapular posture is an integral component of the
   clinical assessment of painful neck disorders. The aim of this study was
   to evaluate agreement between therapist judgements of scapula posture in
   multiple biomechanical planes in individuals with neck pain.
   Design Inter-therapist reliability study.
   Setting Research laboratory.
   Participants Fifteen participants with chronic neck pain.
   Main outcome measures Four physiotherapists recorded ratings of scapular
   orientation (relative to the thorax) in five different scapula postural
   planes (plane of scapula, sagittal plane, transverse plane, horizontal
   plane, and vertical plane) under four test conditions (at rest, and
   during three isometric shoulder conditions) in all participants.
   Inter-therapist reliability was expressed using both generalized and
   paired kappa coefficient.
   Results Following adjustment for expected agreement and the high
   prevalence of neutral ratings (81\%), on average both the generalised
   kappa (0.37) as well as Cohen's Kappa for the two therapist pairs (0.45
   and 0.42) demonstrated only slight to moderate inter-therapist
   reliability.
   Conclusions The findings suggest that ratings of scapular posture in
   individuals with neck pain by visual inspection has only slight to
   moderate reliability and should only be used in conjunction with other
   clinical tests when judging scapula function in these patients. (C) 2015

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Northern Uganda experienced violent conflict for over 15 years,
   resulting in the internal displacement of over 1,800,000 Ugandans. In
   the five years that followed a cease fire agreement in 2006 nearly all
   the displaced persons returned home. The difference in the growth of
   consumption between returnee households and a comparison group of
   non-displaced households is estimated using propensity score matching.
   After an initial shock to consumption and assets upon return, returnee
   households experience a period of catch-up growth. These results
   contribute to understanding the dynamics of recovery from displacement
   and have implications for the policy response during recovery. (C) 2015

   aqueous phase}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{579-588}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The adsorption rate of three tetracyclines (TCs) (tetracycline,
   oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline) on two activated carbons (ACs) were
   investigated in this work. The experimental adsorption equilibrium data
   of the TCs on both carbons was obtained in a batch adsorber at T=298 K
   and pH range of 4-5, and the Langmuir isotherm better interpreted the
   experimental data than the Freundlich isotherm. The adsorption of TCs on
   the ACs was mainly due to pi-pi interactions. The rate of adsorption of
   TCs was interpreted using kinetic models along with diffusional models.
   The pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order were fitted to the
   experimental concentration decay curves of the TCs for the adsorption of
   TCs on ACs. The first-order kinetic model matched reasonably well the
   experimental concentration decay data, but the rate constant, k(1),
   considerably decreased with time. Thus, the rate of adsorption of TCs on
   ACs cannot be interpreted by the first-order kinetic model. The pore
   volume diffusion model (PVDM) and the pore volume and surface diffusion
   model (PVSDM) were also applied to interpret the rate of adsorption of
   TCs. The PVDM overpredicted the experimental concentration decay data
   indicating that intraparticle diffusion was due to both pore volume and
   surface diffusion mechanisms. The PVSDM fitted quite well the
   experimental concentration decay data of the TCs on both ACs, showing
   that the intraparticle diffusion of TCs is due to the pore volume
   diffusion, as well as the surface diffusion. Furthermore, the
   contribution of surface diffusion is directly dependent on the
   adsorption capacity of the carbons because the concentration of TCs
   adsorbed on the surface is the driving force of surface diffusion.
   Additionally, the contribution of surface diffusion is affected by the
   time and radial position. (C) 2015 The Institution of Chemical

Abstract = {{Surveys of inbred strains of mice are standard approaches to determine
   the heritability and range of phenotypic variation for biomedical
   traits. In addition, they may lead to the identification of novel
   phenotypes and models of human disease. Surprisingly, male reproductive
   phenotypes are among the least-represented traits in the Mouse Phenome
   Database. Here we report the results of a broad survey of the eight
   founder inbred strains of both the Collaborative Cross (CC) and the
   Diversity Outbred populations, two new mouse resources that are being
   used as platforms for systems genetics and sources of mouse models of
   human diseases. Our survey includes representatives of the three main
   subspecies of the house mice and a mix of classical and wild-derived
   inbred strains. In addition to standard staples of male reproductive
   phenotyping such as reproductive organ weights, sperm counts, and sperm
   morphology, our survey includes sperm motility and the first detailed
   survey of testis histology. As expected for such a broad survey,
   heritability varies widely among traits. We conclude that although all
   eight inbred strains are fertile, most display a mix of advantageous and
   deleterious male reproductive traits. The CAST/EiJ strain is an outlier,
   with an unusual combination of deleterious male reproductive traits
   including low sperm counts, high levels of morphologically abnormal
   sperm, and poor motility. In contrast, sperm from the PWK/PhJ and
   WSB/EiJ strains had the greatest percentages of normal morphology and
   vigorous motility. Finally, we report an abnormal testis phenotype that
   is highly heritable and restricted to the WSB/EiJ strain. This phenotype
   is characterized by the presence of a large, but variable, number of
   vacuoles in at least 10\% of the seminiferous tubules. The onset of the
   phenotype between 2 and 3 wk of age is temporally correlated with the
   formation of the blood-testis barrier. We speculate that this phenotype
   may play a role in high rates of extinction in the CC project and in the
   phenotypes associated with speciation in genetic crosses that use the
   WSB/EiJ strain as representative of the Mus muculus domesticus
   subspecies.}},

   conversion of urban greenery to impervious landscapes has been
   identified as a key factor influencing the distinctive urban heat and
   associated consequences. Due to the often high demand for space in urban
   areas, creation and preservation of urban greenery as heat sinks is
   commonly perceived as ``a waste of space{''}. Consequently, there is an
   increasing need for creation and preservation of such spaces. This study
   sought to quantify multi-seasonal heat contribution of major
   Land-Use-Land-Cover (LULC) within the Ethekwini Municipal Area (EMA)
   using the recently launched Landsat 8 and MODIS Land Surface and
   Temperature (LST) data-sets. To determine the contribution of urban
   greenery as possible remedy to Urban Heat Island (UHI), major LULCs were
   grouped into four functional zones and Contribution Index (CI) used to
   determine multi-seasonal heat contribution to EMA. Results show that
   impervious surfaces were the major heat source while the green spaces
   were the major heat sinks. Furthermore, the built-up/green spaces
   transition zones accounted for significantly lower heat contribution to
   the entire landscape. The latter finding indicates the value of
   developing greenery mosaics within the often densely built-up urban
   areas. In addition to determining extents of EMA's valuable greenery,
   this study demonstrates the value of remotely sensed data-sets in
   understanding the implication of LULC types on the urban micro-climate.
   The study is particularly valuable for designing sustainable urban
   socio-economic and environmental strategies at local, regional and
   global climate change}},

Abstract = {{We report the demonstration of a scanning probe coherent diffractive
   imaging method (also known as ptychographic CDI) using a compact and
   partially coherent gas-discharge plasma source of extreme ultraviolet
   (EUV) radiation at a 17.3 nm wavelength. Until now, CDI has been mainly
   carried out with coherent, high-brightness light sources, such as third
   generation synchrotrons, x-ray free-electron lasers, and high harmonic
   generation. Here we performed ptychographic lensless imaging of an
   extended sample using a compact, lab-scale source. The CDI
   reconstructions were achieved by applying constraint relaxation to the
   CDI algorithm. Experimental results indicate that our method can handle
   the low spatial coherence and broadband nature of the EUV illumination,
   as well as the residual background due to visible light emitted by the
   gas-discharge source. The ability to conduct ptychographic imaging with
   lab-scale and partially coherent EUV sources is expected to
   significantly expand the applications of this powerful CDI method. (C)

Abstract = {{The rates of delivery by Cesarean section (CS) have been trending
   upwards in recent decades, perhaps leading to higher rates of
   dysfunction in respiratory adaptation in newborns. We present
   epidemiological data for pulmonary adaptation by mode of delivery for
   healthy late preterm and term infants born at a regional tertiary care
   center. The overall CS rate was 22 \% with the largest proportion of
   these in late preterms (39 \%). This drops to 30 \% in infants born
   after 37 weeks gestation and to 11 \% for those born after 40 weeks.
   Infants needing respiratory support decreased significantly as
   gestational age increased: 88 \% at 34 weeks, 67 \% at 35 weeks, 28 \%
   at 36 weeks, 17 \% at 37 weeks and 8 \% at 40 weeks. The risk of
   respiratory morbidity following CS as compared to vaginal delivery (VD)
   was substantially higher. 50 \% of infants born by CS needed respiratory
   support compared to only 12 \% following VD. 82 \% of all late preterm
   infants born by CS developed respiratory morbidity compared to 36 \%
   following VD. Comparable data for infants born after 37 and 40 weeks
   gestation were 33 \% compared to 9 \% and 26 \% compared to 6 \%
   respectively. Late preterm infants born after 36 weeks gestation showed
   the most marked difference by mode of birth with 66 \% needing
   respiratory support following CS as compared to only 9 \% following VD.
   Our data could be useful in counselling parents about risk associated
   with delivery by Cesarean section. A critical view should be taken of
   increasing CS rates worldwide because of a clear correlation in
   increased morbidity in infants, especially late preterm infants.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. Animal experimental study with intervention.
   Objective. We investigated whether sympathectomy and pharmacological
   sympathetic blockade reduced pain behavior and reversed adrenoceptor
   mRNA expression of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in a lumbar
   radiculopathy model.
   Summary of Background Data. The abnormal sympathetic-somatosensory
   interaction may underlie some forms of neuropathic pain. There are
   several reports that sympathectomy and pharmacological sympathetic
   blockades are often effective to treat neuropathic pain. However, its
   pathophysiological mechanisms remain obscure.
   Methods. We used 91 male Sprague-Dawley rats. Just after root
   constriction (RC), the rats underwent sympathectomy or received 3 local
   injections of subtype-specific alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists
   around the DRG. We evaluated the analgesic effects of sympathectomy and
   sympathetic blockade using behaviors indicative mechanical allodynia and
   thermal hyperalgesia. We estimated the mRNA expression levels of the DRG
   adrenoceptor subtypes using real time reverse transcription polymerase
   chain reaction.
   Results. Sympathectomy and alpha(2)-antagonist significantly reduced the
   mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia after RC. Real time
   reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that
   sympathectomy possibly reversed alpha(2A)- and alpha(2B)-adrenoceptors
   mRNA overexpression in the DRG after RC.
   Conclusion. We considered that pain behaviors of neuropathic pain are
   due, at least in part, to enhanced sympathetic noradrenergic
   transmission within the DRG. Suppression of sympathetic activity by
   reducing adrenergic release, alpha(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation, and/or
   alpha(2)-adrenoceptor upregulation in the DRG may relieve neuropathic
   pain.}},

Abstract = {{Utilizing external collections to improve retrieval performance is
   challenging research because various test collections are created for

   approach. Our method incorporates the structure of external collections
   in estimating individual components in the final feedback model.
   Extensive experiments on three medical collections (TREC CDS, CLEF

   a representative expansion approach utilizing the external collections

Abstract = {{The influence of the reduction process on paired-pulse voltammetry
   (PPV), which consists of two identical triangle-shaped pulses, was
   studied in this study by increasing peak potential duration. We propose
   sawhorse waveform as an optimized PPV waveform for enhancing the
   responses of PPV on dopamine and serotonin (5-HT). To investigate the
   influence of the scanning parameters on the reduction process and
   response of PPV, the responses of dopamine were measured by changing the
   switching potential (from 1.04 to 1.5V), and scan rates (from 400V/s to
   1000V/s) based on triangle shaped PPV. As a result, the oxidation and
   reduction peak ratio in the response of the primary pulse in PPV
   decreased in a linear fashion with increases to the duration between
   oxidation and reduction potential, which lead us to obtain more defined
   features in the subtracted voltammograms (primary-secondary) in PPV.
   Based on these results, sawhorse waveform PPV with prolonged switching
   potential duration was suggested to increase the sensitivity of PPV
   while maintaining its own advantages, and it is also confirmed in an in
   vivo experiment. In addition to the dopamine experiments, we also
   conducted an experiment with serotonin utilizing the N-shaped sawhorse
   waveform PPV. The subtracted voltammogram in the N-shaped PPV with 1.0V
   peak and 4ms peak potential duration clearly showed the characteristics
   of serotonin. In conclusion, PPV waveforms could be optimized to improve
   the sensitivity of PPV responses by the control of the reduction
   process.}},

Abstract = {{The role of death receptor 5 (DR5), a well-known cell surface
   pro-apoptotic protein, in the negative regulation of invasion and
   metastasis of human cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms are

   we have demonstrated that DR5 functions to suppress invasion and
   metastasis of human cancer cells, as evidenced by enhanced cancer cell
   invasion and metastasis upon genetic suppression of DR5 either by gene
   knockdown or knockout. When DR5 is suppressed, FADD and caspase-8 may
   recruit and stabilize TRAF2 to form a metastasis and invasion signaling
   complex, resulting in activation of ERK and JNK/AP-1 signaling that
   mediate the elevation and activation of matrix metalloproteinase-1
   (MMP1) and eventual promotion of cancer invasion and metastasis. Our
   findings thus highlight a novel non-apoptotic function of DR5 as a
   suppressor of human cancer cell invasion and metastasis and suggest a
   basic working model elucidating the underlying biology.}},

   Increased perioperative blood loss (p = 0.029214), a longer hospital
   stay (p = 0.026668) and the development of SSI (p = 0.000181) were
   significantly correlated with the open method. There was no correlation
   between SSI and the body mass index, or between SSI and the length of
   the surgery or diabetes mellitus. However, patients that developed SSI
   tended to be obese.
   The open method was associated with a higher incidence of SSI.
   Therefore, it is necessary to consider potential contamination of the
   surgical field at the time of anastomosis to reduce the incidence of
   SSI.}},

Abstract = {{Based largely on old retrospective reports, the recommendation of
   injecting BoNT as infrequently as possible, with the lowest possible
   dose, was formed. While BoNT is inherently immunogenic, with improved
   production, most patients no longer develop immune resistance and poor
   response to BoNT is often due to other factors.
   In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) using abobotulinumtoxinA for
   cervical dystonia (CD) by the German Dystonia Study Group, half of the
   patients treated with 250 and 500 U, and 39\% in the 1000 U group
   required retreatment after 8 weeks. In a RCT comparing
   onabotulinumtoxinA and incobotulinumtoxinA for CD by Benecke et al.,
   waning of effect was noted in 70 days for both toxins. Finally, two
   long-term prospective trials employing flexible intervals, with
   reinjections based on patient's request, have been performed using
   incobotulinumtoxinA. In the CD study, 22.5\% were re-injected in <10
   weeks and 24.6\% between 10 and 12 weeks. In the blepharospasm study,
   the median injection interval was 6-10 weeks for 23.7\% and 10-12 weeks
   for 32.3\%)
   While long-term studies utilizing flexible/shortened intervals, with
   vigilance over immunogenicity are needed, the majority of current
   evidence no longer support the very stringent adherence to strict 90-day
   BoNT injection intervals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a damage-associated molecular
   pattern (DAMP) protein that binds Toll-like receptors (e.g., TLR4) and
   the receptor for advanced glycated end products (RAGE). The direct
   effects of HMGB1 on airway structural cells are not fully known. As
   epithelial cell responses are fundamental drivers of asthma, including
   abnormal repair-restitution linked to changes in extracellular matrix
   (ECM) synthesis, we tested the hypothesis that HMGB1 promotes bronchial
   epithelial cell wound repair via TLR4 and/or RAGE signaling that
   regulates ECM (fibronectin and the gamma(2)-chain of laminin-5) and
   integrin protein abundance. To assess impact of HMGB1 we used molecular
   and pharmacological inhibitors of RAGE or TLR4 signaling in scratch
   wound, immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting assays to assess wound
   repair, ECM synthesis, and phosphorylation of intracellular signaling.
   HMGB1 increased wound closure, and this effect was attenuated by
   blocking RAGE and TLR4 signaling. HMGB1-induced fibronectin and
   laminin-5 (gamma 2 chain) was diminished by blocking RAGE and/or
   blunting TLR4 signaling. Similarly, induction of alpha(3)-integrin
   receptor for fibronectin and laminin-5 was also diminished by blocking
   TLR4 signaling and RAGE. Lastly, rapid and/or sustained phosphorylation
   of SMAD2, ERK1/2, and JNK signaling modulated HMGB1-induced wound
   closure. Our findings suggest a role for HMGB1 in human airway
   epithelial cell repair and restitution via multiple pathways mediated by
   TLR4 and RAGE that underpin increased ECM synthesis and modulation of
   cell-matrix adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{Volatile compounds with antifungal activity produced by edible mushrooms
   have potential as biological control agents to combat fungal diseases
   and reduce fungicide use in agriculture. Here we investigated the
   antifungal activity of volatile compounds produced by the edible
   mushroom Hypsizygus marmoreus (TUFC 11906) against eight phytopathogenic
   fungi. The results showed that volatile compounds from the mycelia and
   culture filtrates (CFs) of H.marmoreus had antifungal activity against
   some phytopathogenic fungi. Among them, the mycelial growth and conidial
   germination of Alternaria brassicicola were significantly inhibited by
   60 and 100\%, respectively. Moreover, the volatile compounds from CFs
   inhibited the lesion formation of A.brassicicola on detached cabbage
   leaves by 94\%. The volatile compounds had higher antifungal activity
   against A.brassicicola than other fungi. With the removal of the
   volatile compounds from conidia of A.brassicicola, the conidia began to
   germinate, which indicates fungistatic activity of the compounds. The
   volatile compounds were isolated from the CFs of H.marmoreus, and the
   major volatile compound with antifungal activity was estimated to be
   2-methylpropanoic acid 2,2-dimethyl-1-(2-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)propyl
   ester. As the volatile compound produced by H.marmoreus is a product of
   an edible mushroom and has fungistatic activity against some
   phytopathogenic fungi, especially A.brassicicola, it may be possible to
   use the compounds as a novel safe agent for protecting crops in the
   field and during storage.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{Background: There is little information on the impact of statins on
   hospital length of stay (LOS) or readmission among patients with sepsis.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the association
   between statin use and LOS and all-cause readmissions among sepsis
   patients hospitalized in the medical unit. Methods: The design was a
   retrospective propensity score-matched study of adult patients with a
   primary diagnosis of sepsis from 2007 to 2013. Information was extracted
   from the electronic health record. Sepsis patients were identified using
   ICD-9CM codes. Propensity scores estimated the probability that a
   patient would be on statins, and patients who were on statins were then
   matched with those who were not, within +/- 0.05. Additional greedy
   matching criteria were organ dysfunction (yes/no) and all patient
   refined diagnosis-related group (APR-DRG) medical/surgical. The primary
   outcome was LOS, and the secondary outcomes were all-cause readmission
   at 30, 60, and 90 days, adjusted for age, sex, modified Deyo-Charlson
   comorbidity index, APR-DRG severity of illness (SOI), and APR-DRG
   medical/surgical, as appropriate. Results: Patients taking statins had a
   shorter LOS than patients not taking statins, 8.7 +/- 3.7 and 10.3 +/-
   2.7 days, respectively (P value = 0.018). There was no significant
   difference (P> 0.05) in all cause readmissions between statin and
   nonstatin patients. Presence of comorbidities and SOI were significant
   factors for 60- and 90-day readmissions. Conclusions: The use of statins
   among patients admitted with primary sepsis in the medical unit was
   associated with shorter length of hospital stay. However, it did not
   affect frequency of readmissions.}},

Abstract = {{Nile perch (Lates niloticus) viscera oil was extracted by wet rendering
   method and refined by neutralization, deodorization and winterization.
   After winterization, the oil was decanted and separated by filtration
   into a low melting point fraction (LMPF) and a high melting point
   fraction (HMPF). The two fractions were used to carry out storage
   stability study. Each fraction was stored at room temperature (19 - 23
   degrees C) for a period of 20 weeks in transparent and amber colored
   glass containers. The oil fractions were subjected to quality tests to
   assess their storage stability. The effects of package color and storage
   duration were assessed by analyzing for the content of free fatty acids
   (FFA) as oleic acid and the peroxide value (PV) at the beginning of
   storage and at intervals of two weeks during storage. The resulting data
   were subjected to statistical analysis (p d{''} 0.05) using GenStat
   software, 13th edition. There was a general increase in FFA and PV, with
   significant differences between oil fractions and package color over
   storage time. For FFA, there was no interaction between the oil fraction
   and package color while for PV there was significant interaction between
   the oil fraction and package color. FFA increased from 0.26\% to 0.59\%
   for LMPF in clear package, 0.26 - 0.43\% for LMPF in red package, 0.22 -
   0.85\% for HMPF in clear package, and 0.22 - 0.69\% for HMPF in red
   package. PV increased from 0.50 mEq O-2/kg oil to 11.65 mEq O-2/kg oil
   for LMPF in clear package, from 0.5058 mEq O-2/kg oil to 10.58 mEq
   O-2/kg oil for LMPF in red package, from 1.01 mEq O-2/kg oil to 9.94 mEq
   O-2/kg oil for HMPF in clear package, after 20 weeks, and from 1.01 mEq
   O-2/kg oil -6.86 mEq O-2/kg oil for HMPF in red package after 14 weeks.
   The levels of FFA and PV of LMPF in colored package remained within the
   CODEX limits of 0.3\% and 5 mEq O-2/kg oil respectively for refined fish
   oils up to 18 weeks. The FFA of HMPF surpassed the limit after 6 and 10
   weeks for transparent and colored packages respectively. The FFA of LMPF
   in transparent package surpassed the limit after 8 weeks. Only low
   melting point oil fraction in transparent pack had PV above limit at 18
   weeks. Results showed that colored package is more suitable for both oil
   fractions studied. In terms of FFA and PV, HMPF and LMPF can retain good
   quality at ambient temperatures for 10 and 18 weeks respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A considerable number of reports have been published in recent years on
   G protein-coupled receptors, their distribution in the body, mechanism
   of activation, and potential pathways for pharmacological actions.
   Intermediates in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism and the
   tricarboxylic acid cycle, operating as endogenous ligands for a large
   group of ex-orphan receptors, have active roles in regulating metabolic
   processes, while their synthetic analogs, operating as both agonists and
   antagonists, may have potential for the development of new
   pharmaceuticals for a wide range of diseases (diabetes mellitus,
   obesity, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune disorders, hypertension,
   myocardial hypertrophy and ischemia, neurodegenerative processes, liver
   diseases, etc.). The present review addresses GPR91 (SUCNR1) receptors,
   which have been identified in fatty tissue, liver, kidneys, heart,
   brain, retinal neurons, dendritic cells, and platelets, and which are
   regarded as physiological regulators and cell sensors for stress-induced
   damage and hypoxia.}},

Abstract = {{Muscle deoxygenation (i.e., deoxy{[}Hb + Mb]) during exercise assesses
   the matching of oxygen delivery ((Q) over dot(O2)) to oxygen utilization
   ((V) over dot(O2)). Until now limitations in near-infrared spectroscopy
   (NIRS) technology did not permit discrimination of deoxy{[}Hb + Mb]
   between superficial and deep muscles. In humans, the deep quadriceps is
   more highly vascularized and oxidative than the superficial quadriceps.
   Using high-power time-resolved NIRS, we tested the hypothesis that
   deoxygenation of the deep quadriceps would be less than in superficial
   muscle during incremental cycling exercise in eight males. Pulmonary (V)
   over dot(O2) was measured and muscle deoxy{[}Hb + Mb] was determined in
   the superficial vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and rectus
   femoris (RF-s) and the deep rectus femoris (RF-d). deoxy{[}Hb + Mb] in
   RF-d was significantly less than VL at 70\% (67.2 +/- 7.0 vs. 75.5 +/-
   10.7 mu M) and 80\% (71.4 +/- 11.0 vs. 79.0 +/- 15.4 mu M) of peak work
   rate (WRpeak), but greater than VL and VM at WRpeak (87.7 +/- 32.5 vs.
   76.6 +/- 17.5 and 75.1 +/- 19.9 mu M). RF-s was intermediate at WRpeak
   (82.6 +/- 18.7 mu M). Total hemoglobin and myoglobin concentration and
   tissue oxygen saturation were significantly greater in RF-d than RF-s
   throughout exercise. The slope of deoxy{[}Hb + Mb] increase
   (proportional to (Q) over dot(O2)/(V) over dot(O2)) in VL and VM slowed
   markedly above 70\% WRpeak, whereas it became greater in RF-d. This
   divergent deoxygenation pattern may be due to a greater population of
   slowt-witch muscle fibers in the RF-d muscle and the differential
   recruitment profiles and vascular and metabolic control properties of
   specific fiber populations within superficial and deeper muscle regions.}},

Abstract = {{One of the core assumptions of life-history theory is the negative
   trade-off between current and future reproduction. Investment in current
   reproduction is expected to decrease future reproductive success or
   survival, but the physiological mechanisms underlying these costs are
   still obscure. To test for a role of oxidative stress, we measured
   oxidative damage to lipids and proteins in liver, heart, kidneys and
   muscles, as well as the level of antioxidants (total glutathione and
   catalase), in breeding and non-breeding bank voles. We used females from
   lines selected for high aerobic metabolism and non-selected control
   lines and manipulated their reproductive investment by decreasing or
   increasing litter size. Unlike in most previous studies, the females
   reared four consecutive litters (the maximum possible during a breeding
   season). Contrary to predictions, oxidative damage in reproducing
   females was decreased or not changed, and did not differ between the
   selected and control lines. Oxidative damage to lipids and proteins in
   the liver was lower in females that weaned enlarged litters than in
   non-breeding ones, and was intermediate in those with reduced litters.
   Oxidative damage to proteins in the heart also tended to be lower in
   breeding females than in non-breeding ones. A negative relationship
   between the level of oxidative damage and activity of catalase in
   kidneys indicated a protective action of antioxidants. In conclusion,
   our study falsified the hypothesis that oxidative stress is a part of
   the proximate physiological mechanism underlying the fundamental
   life-history trade-off between current and future reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating lung
   disease of unknown etiology. The genes TOLLIP and MUC5B play important
   roles in lung host defense, which is an immune process influenced by
   oxidative signaling. Whether polymorphisms in TOLLIP and MUC5B modify
   the effect of immunosuppressive and antioxidant therapy in individuals
   with IPF is unknown.
   Objectives: To determine whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
   within TOLLIP and MUC5B modify the effect of interventions in subjects
   participating in the Evaluating the Effectiveness of Prednisone,
   Azathioprine, and N-Acetylcysteine in Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary
   Fibrosis (PANTHER-IPF) clinical trial.
   Methods: SNPs within TOLLIP (rs5743890/rs5743894/rs5743854/rs3750920)
   and MUC5B (rs35705950) were genotyped. Interaction modeling was
   conducted with multivariable Cox regression followed by
   genotype-stratified survival analysis using a composite endpoint of
   death, transplantation, hospitalization, or a decline of >= 10\% in FVC.
   Measurements and Main Results: Significant interaction was observed
   between N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy and rs3750920 within TOLLIP
   (P-interaction = 0.001). After stratifying by rs3750920 genotype, NAC
   therapy was associated with a significant reduction in composite
   endpoint risk (hazard ratio, 0.14; 95\% confidence interval, 0.02-0.83;
   P = 0.03) in those with a TT genotype, but a nonsignificant increase in
   composite endpoint risk (hazard ratio, 3.23; 95\% confidence interval,
   0.79-13.16; P = 0.10) was seen in those with a CC genotype. These
   findings were then replicated in an independent IPF cohort.
   Conclusions: NAC may be an efficacious therapy for individuals with IPF
   with an rs3750920 (TOLLIP) TT genotype, but it was associated with a
   trend toward harm in those with a CC genotype. A genotype-stratified
   prospective clinical trial should be conducted before any recommendation
   regarding the use of off-label NAC to treat IPF.}},

   studied in nature (Tver oblast) taking into account their species, sex,
   and age. The research was performed by comparing (criterion chi(2),
   exact confidence interval for binomial distribution) the number of
   recipient individuals captured by traps with the scent of animals that
   previously contacted them and the number of animals that could be
   expected under the random distribution of captures. All responses of the
   animals to the scent unintentionally left by other individuals were
   regarded as manifestations of mediated olfactory communications.
   Positive responses ({''}the observed number of captures is greater than
   that expected{''}) absolutely prevail in the intraspecific relations
   within all the species and sex-age groups. They also play an important
   role in the interspecific relations, which is particularly noticeable in
   the yearlings of red-toothed shrews. The responses of these animals to
   the odor of bank voles vary from neutral to negative. It was shown that
   S. minutus avoids the scent of other species. Seasonal changes in the
   responses to the odor of different species and sex-age groups were
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring change in a latent variable over time is often done using the

Abstract = {{Group A streptococcus (GAS), the causative agent of pharyngitis and
   necrotizing fasciitis, secretes the potent cysteine protease SpeB.
   Several lines of evidence suggest that SpeB is an important virulence
   factor. SpeB is expressed in human infections, protects mice from lethal
   challenge when used as a vaccine, and contributes significantly to
   tissue destruction and dissemination in animal models. However, recent
   descriptions of mutations in genes implicated in SpeB production have
   led to the idea that GAS may be under selective pressure to decrease
   secreted SpeB protease activity during infection. Thus, two divergent
   hypotheses have been proposed. One postulates that SpeB is a key
   contributor to pathogenesis; the other, that GAS is under selection to
   decrease SpeB during infection. In order to distinguish between these
   alternative hypotheses, we performed casein hydrolysis assays to measure
   the SpeB protease activity secreted by 6,775 GAS strains recovered from
   infected humans. The results demonstrated that 84.3\% of the strains
   have a wild-type SpeB protease phenotype. The availability of
   whole-genome sequence data allowed us to determine the relative
   frequencies of mutations in genes implicated in SpeB production. The
   most abundantly mutated genes were direct transcription regulators. We
   also sequenced the genomes of 2,954 GAS isolates recovered from nonhuman
   primates with experimental necrotizing fasciitis. No mutations that
   would result in a SpeB-deficient phenotype were identified. Taken
   together, these data unambiguously demonstrate that the great majority
   of GAS strains recovered from infected humans secrete wild-type levels
   of SpeB protease activity. Our data confirm the important role of SpeB
   in GAS pathogenesis and help end a long-standing controversy.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDThis study examines the extent to which high alcohol
   consumption, drug use, and delinquency vary between schools with
   different socioeconomic characteristics, over and above the pupil's own
   sociodemographic background.
   METHODSAnalyses are based on data on 5484 ninth-grade students
   distributed over 93 schools in Stockholm, from the 2010 Stockholm School
   Survey. School-level information was retrieved from the Swedish National
   Agency for Education. School disadvantage was determined by combining
   information on the level of education among parents and the share of
   pupils with a nonnative background, 2 aspects that have been shown to be
   central to school segregation in Sweden.
   RESULTSResults indicate significant school-to-school differences in
   relation to all outcomes. The risk for high alcohol consumption and drug
   use is greater in more advantaged school settings, adjusting for
   individual characteristics, whereas the opposite is true in relation to
   criminal behavior. The school's level of collective efficacy also seems
   to play an important, albeit not mediating, role.
   CONCLUSIONSRegardless of an adolescent's own background, the risk of
   having adverse health behaviors is higher at certain schools compared to
   others. However, school socioeconomic factors do not influence health
   behaviors consistently; instead, it seems as if the association varies
   depending on the behavior under study.}},

Abstract = {{AimsThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical impact of
   addition of {[}C-11]Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography
   (C-11-PiB PET) on routine clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD)
   dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and to assess diagnostic
   agreement between clinical criteria and research criteria of the
   National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association.
   MethodsThe diagnosis in 85 patients was made according to clinical
   criteria. Imaging examinations, including both magnetic resonance
   imaging and single-photon emission computed tomography/computed
   tomography to identify neuronal injury (NI), and C-11-PiB PET to
   identify amyloid were performed, and all subjects were re-categorized
   according to the research criteria.
   ResultsAmong 40 patients with probable AD dementia (ProAD), 37 were
   NI-positive, 29 were C-11-PiB-positive, and 27 who were both NI- and
   C-11-PiB-positive were categorized as having ProAD dementia with a high
   level of evidence of the AD pathophysiological process'. Among 20
   patients with possible AD dementia (PosAD), 17 were NI-positive, and six
   who were both NI- and C-11-PiB-positive were categorized as having PosAD
   with evidence of the AD pathophysiological process'. Among 25 patients
   with MCI, 18 were NI-positive, 13 were C-11-PiB-positive, and 10 who
   were both NI- and C-11-PiB-positive were categorized as having MCI due
   to AD-high likelihood'.
   ConclusionsDiagnostic concordance between clinical criteria and research
   criteria may not be high in this study. C-11-PiB PET may be of value in
   making the diagnosis of dementia and MCI in cases with high diagnostic
   uncertainty.}},

Title = {{A biomechanical investigation of mandibular molar implants:
   reproducibility and validity of a finite element analysis model}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPLANT DENTISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) is effective
   in analyzing stress distributions around dental implants. However, FEA
   of living tissue involves many conditions, and the structures and
   behaviors are complex; thus, it is difficult to ensure the validity of
   the results. To verify reproducibility and validity, we embedded
   implants in experimental models and constructed FEA models; implant
   displacements were compared under various loading conditions.
   Methods: Implants were embedded in the molar regions of artificial
   mandibles to fabricate three experimental models. A titanium
   superstructure was fabricated and three loading points (buccal, central,
   and lingual) were placed on a first molar. A vertical load of 100 N was
   applied to each loading point and implant displacements were measured.
   Next, the experimental models were scanned on micro-computed tomography
   (CT) and three-dimensional FEA software was used to construct two model
   types. A model where a contact condition was assumed for the implant and
   artificial mandible (a contact model) was constructed, as was a model
   where a fixation condition was assumed (a fixation model). The FEA
   models were analyzed under similar conditions as the experimental
   models; implant displacements under loading conditions were compared
   between the experimental and FEA models. Reproducibility of the models
   was assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV), and validity was
   assessed using a correlation coefficient.
   Results: The CV of implant displacement was 5\% to 10\% in the
   experimental and FEA models under loading conditions. Absolute values of
   implant displacement under loading were smaller in FEA models than the
   experimental model, but the displacement tendency at each loading site
   was similar. The correlation coefficient between the experimental and
   contact models for implant displacement under loading was 0.925 (p <
   0.01). The CVs of equivalent stress values in the FEA models were 0.52\%
   to 45.99\%.
   Conclusions: Three-dimensional FEA models were reflective of
   experimental model displacements and produced highly valid results.
   Three-dimensional FEA is effective for investigating the behavioral
   tendencies of implants under loading conditions. However, the validity
   of the absolute values was low and the reproducibility of the equivalent
   stresses was inferior; thus, the results should be interpreted with
   caution.}},

Abstract = {{Pragmatism, which is one of the mainstreams of the philosophy of law,
   became popular in the UK especially after the 18th century on the basis
   of utilitarianism, and in the USA and Scandinavian countries after the
   19th century on the basis of realism. Books on philosophy of law and
   legal theory discuss these philosophies under the headings of pragmatist
   and realist philosophies of law, and present it basically as a
   continuation of the British and American philosophy. However, the roots
   of these legal movements, which are epistemologically experimental and
   sensational, ontologically realistic, and ethically utilitarian and
   relativist should be sought in the whole history of philosophy
   especially in Ancient Greek Philosophy. Thus, to show this historical
   background, in the article, we try to return to the history of
   utilitarianism, pragmatism, realism and relativism in philosophical
   thought. In the last part of the article, with the help of examples
   taken from some assessments of contemporary pragmatist and realist

Abstract = {{Increasingly, it is recognised that the abundant resources of
   evolutionized biological materials and structures provide an exciting
   opportunity for growth in the area of materials engineering for impact
   and projectile resistance. A bio-inspired cellular structural system is
   developed to contain the radial fracture damage of mortar due to
   projectile impact through boundary impedance mismatch, while utilizing
   its adjacent cells as a mutual confining mechanism to improve
   penetration resistance. The penetration resistance was evaluated on a
   hexagon cell which is confined mutually by six other identical
   neighbouring cells in a rigid mould and subjected to a 7.77 g, 8 mm
   diameter, AISI4140 High Strength Steel projectile impact at similar to
   450 m/s. Three cell sizes (50 mm, 70 mm and 90 mm) with two types of
   cellular interface material (air and silicone) were investigated. These
   were then compared against monolithically cast mortar control specimens
   of their respective sizes. It was found that the cellular design was
   effective in significantly reducing the radial damage for an incoming
   projectile by up to 26\%, with a modest increase in penetration depth of
   up to 12\%. Furthermore, specimens with silicon as the cellular
   interface material demonstrated a 33\% reduction in proximal crater
   damage across all specimen sizes tested, with up to 10\% increase in
   penetration depth. Numerical Simulations using LS-Dyna in 3D
   quarter-symmetry has also led to better understanding of the physical
   shockwave interactions modified by a cellular design, allowed
   verification of the experimental results and supported the authors'
   explanations of the physical phenomena. Overall, penetration depths and
   crater diameters were within 10\% and 20\% of the experimental results
   respectively. This research has useful field applications when extensive
   radial damage is costly to repair, and penetration resistance is not the
   most critical consideration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   formation of antral follicle-like structures (AFLSs) and on the meiotic
   status of bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) embedded in collagen
   gel. Supplementation with dbcAMP increased the mean diameter of AFLSs
   during days 4-8 of culture compared with that of control COCs,
   irrespective of the concentration of dbcAMP used (0.5-2.0 mM). When the
   embedded COCs were cultured for 8 days with hCG, the diameters of AFLSs
   after 4 days of culture tended to be lower in the supplemented COCs than
   in the control COCs without hCG, irrespective of the concentration used
   (1-100 IU/mL). Supplementation with 10 IU/mL hCG increased the
   concentrations of anti-Mullerian hormone but not progesterone and
   oestradiol in the culture medium after 4 days of culture. Almost all
   oocytes collected from AFLSs had resumed meiosis by the end of culture,
   irrespective of supplementation of dbcAMP and hCG. These results
   indicate that although dbcAMP had a positive effect on AFLS formation

Title = {{All-Cause and Cause-Specific Risk of Emergency Transport Attributable to
   Temperature A Nationwide Study}},
Journal = {{MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{51}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although several studies have estimated the associations between
   mortality or morbidity and extreme temperatures in terms of relative
   risk, few studies have investigated the risk of emergency transport
   attributable to the whole temperature range nationwide.
   We acquired data on daily emergency ambulance dispatches in all 47
   prefectures of Japan from 2007 to 2010. We examined the relationship
   between emergency transport and temperature for each prefecture using a
   Poisson regression model in a distributed lag nonlinear model with
   adjustment for time trends. A random-effect multivariate meta-analysis
   was then applied to pool the estimates at the national level.
   Attributable morbidity was calculated for high and low temperatures,
   which were defined as those above or below the optimum temperature (ie,
   the minimum morbidity temperature) and for moderate and also extreme
   temperatures, which were defined using cutoffs at the 2.5th and 97.5th
   temperature percentiles.
   A total of 15,868,086 cases of emergency transport met the inclusion
   criteria. The emergency transport was attributable to nonoptimal
   temperature. The median minimum morbidity percentile was in the 79th
   percentile for all causes, the 96th percentile for cardiovascular
   disease, and the 92th percentile for respiratory disease. The fraction
   attributable to low temperature was 6.94\% (95\% eCI: 5.93-7.70) for all
   causes, 17.93\% (95\% eCI: 16.10-19.25) for cardiovascular disease, and
   12.19\% (95\% eCI: 9.90-13.66) for respiratory disease, whereas the
   fraction attributable to high temperature was small (all causes =
   1.01\%, 95\% eCI: 0.90-1.11; cardiovascular disease = 0.10\%, 95\% eCI:
   0.04-0.14; respiratory disease = 0.29\%, 95\% eCI: 0.07-0.50). The
   all-cause morbidity risk that was attributable to temperature was
   related to moderate cold, with an overall estimate of 6.41\% (95\% eCI:
   5.47-7.20). Extreme temperatures were responsible for a small fraction,
   which corresponded to 0.57\% (95\% eCI: 0.50-0.62) for extreme low
   temperature and 0.29\% (95\% eCI: 0.26-0.32) for extreme high
   temperature. The same trends were observed for cardiovascular and
   respiratory diseases.
   The majority of temperature-related emergency transport burden was
   attributable to lower temperature. The effect of extremely high or low
   temperatures was markedly lower than that attributable to moderately
   nonoptimal temperatures.}},

   (azoxyphenetol, AOP) of an eutectic composition and
   heptakis-(2,3,6-tri-O-benzoyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (Bz-beta-CD) are
   studied. For 30 organic compounds of different classes with linear and
   cyclic molecular structures, including optical isomers of limonene,
   pinene, camphene, and butanediol-2,3, thermodynamic functions are
   determined for their gas-phase sorption using a three-component
   MEAB-AOP-Bz-beta- CD sorbent (62: 28: 10 wt \%). It is found that the
   investigated sorbent possesses high structural selectivity (alpha(p/m) =
   1.128-1.059, 100-130A degrees C, N) and moderate enantioselectivity
   (1.07-1.02) within a broad temperature range (95-170A degrees C)
   including both mesomorphic and isotropic phases of the sorbent. It is
   shown that the enantioselectivity of the sorbent is apparent under
   conditions of both increasing retention when a chiral Bz-beta-CD
   additive is introduced into the MEAB-AOP system (limonenes, pinenes,
   camphenes) and decreasing retention (butanediols-2,3).}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to assess the energy potential of food waste
   energy harvesting system (digestion followed by pyrolysis of digestate).
   Digestate (DFW) with increased calorific content was produced after a
   commercial one stage anaerobic digestion of the raw food waste (RFW).
   Separate pyrolysis of RFW and DEW (digestated food waste) distributed
   15.7 MJ/kg and 17.2 MJ/kg respectively, among the gas, char and bio-oil,
   while energy of pyrolysis at 0.72 MJ/kg for RFW and 0.87 MJ/kg for DEW
   at the heating rate of 10 degrees C/min to 500 degrees C. Increase in
   the digestate specific heat to 2.5 MJ/m(3) and its significant ash
   difference reflects the substrate (RFW) transformation due to
   biochemical treatment. The thermogravimetric analysis indicated the
   substrates mass dynamics and stability extent of the treatment products
   (DFW, RFW500 and DFW500). Generally, transitional energy base products
   (biogas and bio-oil) are generated through the energy harvesting system
   (EHS) of food waste, while energy rich solid fuels can be produced
   through pyrolysis at 500 degrees C. Thus, the sustainable potential of
   EHS to widen and broaden recycling capacity of biomass and smartly
   appropriate its resources are demonstrated to be dependent and pivoted
   on the adopted treatment method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT}},

Volume = {{91}},

Abstract = {{Aim: This study examined the rates of follow-up for a cohort of
   extremely preterm (EP -<28 weeks gestation) and/or extremely low
   birthweight (ELBW -<1000 g) children at two years with related perinatal
   and geographical factors. The secondary aim was to determine the rates
   of developmental delay and disability.
   Methods: A retrospective review of two year follow-up data for all EP
   and/or ELBW infants born in a large tertiary neonatal hospital over a
   two year period was undertaken. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed
   using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Scale - 3rd
   edition (Bayley-III) and neurosensory disability was assessed by a
   paediatrician using a standard proforma. Rates of delay (composite score
   >= 1SD below mean) were determined using the Bayley-III test norms and a
   local cohort normative group. Attrition rates and reasons for loss to
   follow-up were determined.
   Results: Only 50\% (109/219) of eligible children participated in the
   follow-up. The follow-up rate for children engaged in an ongoing
   research project was excellent at 98\% (58/59), however it was only 32\%
   (51/160) for children following the clinical pathway. The main reason
   for not attending the follow-up was loss of contact. Factors associated
   with attendance included a lower gestation, sepsis and living in the
   metropolitan areas. The rates of delay in this cohort were greater with
   reference to local cohort normative data compared to Bayley-III test
   norms with an overall rate of delay of 72\% (95\%CI, 63\% to 81\%)
   compared to 38\% (95\%CI, 29\% to 50\%).
   Conclusions: Follow-up of EP/ELBW infants to two years is an important
   part of clinical care, however the high rate of attrition in routine
   clinical follow-up and consequent difficulty in accurately determining
   rates of delay highlight challenges for centres providing ongoing care.

   The active porosity is taken to mean the bulk porosity less the pore

   active porosity discussed in the paper are based on finding the
   adsorbed-water volume at the maximal air-dry moisture of soil and

Abstract = {{Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) is a minimally invasive
   technique that is increasingly being used to treat early rectal cancer
   (T1/T2). We studied the outcomes of TEM for rectal cancer at our
   institution looking at the indication, recurrence rate, need for further
   radical surgery, 30-day and 12-month mortality and complication rate. We
   performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of
   cases between 2008 and 2012: 110 TEM procedures were performed during
   this period: 40 were confirmed rectal cancers and 70 were benign. We
   analysed the data for the 40 patients with confirmed rectal cancer.
   Thirty (75 \%) of the subjects were male with a mean age of 71 +/- 10
   years (range 49-90 years) and 19 (48 \%) patients were ASA 3 and 4.
   Nineteen (48 \%) of cancers were pT1, eighteen (45 \%) were pT2, two (5
   \%) were pT3 and one was yPT0. Mean specimen size was 66 +/- 20 mm
   (range 33-120 mm) with a mean polyp size of 41 +/- 24 mm (range 18-110
   mm). The mean cancer size was 24 +/- 13 mm (range 2-50 mm). Average
   distance from the anal verge was 70 +/- 37mm (range 10-150 mm), and the
   mean operating time was 72 +/- 22 min (range 40-120 min), with an
   average blood loss of 28 +/- 15ml (range 10-50ml). Median hospital stay
   was 2 +/- 1 days (range 1-7 days). Complete excision (R0) was achieved
   in 37 (93 \%) patients. Minor post-operative complications included
   urinary retention in two and pyrexia in three patients. There were no
   30-day or 12-month mortalities. Mean follow-up was 13 +/- 11 months,
   range (3-40 months) Local recurrence occurred in two (5 \%) patients,
   both underwent redo TEM. Twelve (30 \%) patients underwent laparoscopic
   radical resections (seven AR and five APER) post-TEM. Post-operative
   histology confirmed pT0N0 in 7/12 patients. Three were lymph
   node-positive (T0N1), one was pT3N1 and the fifth was pT3N2. TEM is
   associated with quicker recovery, shorter hospital stay and fewer
   complications than radical surgery. It is a good alternative to radical
   surgery in early rectal cancer, especially for high-risk patients.
   Recurrent tumours can be treated with redo TEM.}},

Abstract = {{Aims Recent cost-effectiveness analyses of percutaneous coronary
   intervention (PCI) versus coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) have
   been limited by a short time horizon or were restricted to the US
   healthcare perspective. We, therefore, used individual patient-level
   data from the SYNTAX trial to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PCI
   versus CABG from a European (Dutch) perspective.
   Methods and results Between 2005 and 2007, 1800 patients with
   three-vessel or left main coronary artery disease were randomised to
   either CABG (n=897) or PCI with drug-eluting stents (DES; n=903). Costs
   were estimated for all patients based on observed healthcare resource
   usage over 5 years of follow-up. Health state utilities were evaluated
   with the EuroQOL questionnaire. A patient-level microsimulation model
   based on Dutch life-tables was used to extrapolate the 5-year in-trial
   data to a lifetime horizon. Although initial procedural costs were lower
   for CABG, total initial hospitalisation costs per patient were higher
   ((sic)17 506 vs (isc)14 037, p<0.001). PCI was more costly during the
   next 5 years of follow-up, due to more frequent hospitalisations, repeat
   revascularisation procedures and higher medication costs. Nevertheless,
   total 5-year costs remained (sic)2465/patient higher with CABG. When the
   in-trial results were extrapolated to a lifetime horizon, CABG was
   projected to be economically attractive relative to DES-PCI, with gains
   in both life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy. The
   incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ((sic)5390/quality-adjusted
   life year (QALY) gained) was favourable and remained <(sic)80 000/QALY
   in >90\% of the bootstrap replicates. Outcomes were similar when
   incorporating the prognostic impact of non-fatal myocardial infarction
   and stroke, as well as across a broad range of assumptions regarding the
   effect of CABG on post-trial survival and costs. However, DES-PCI was
   economically dominant compared with CABG in patients with a SYNTAX Score
   <= 22 or in those with left main disease. In patients for whom the
   SYNTAX Score II favoured PCI based on lower predicted 4-year mortality,
   PCI was also economically dominant, whereas in those patients for whom
   the SYNTAX Score II favoured surgery, CABG was highly economically
   attractive (ICER range, (sic)2967 to (sic)3737/QALY gained).
   Conclusions For the broad population with three-vessel or left main
   disease who are candidates for either CABG or PCI, we found that CABG is
   a clinically and economically attractive revascularisation strategy
   compared with DES-PCI from a Dutch healthcare perspective. The
   cost-effectiveness of CABG versus PCI differed according to several
   anatomic factors, however. The newly developed SYNTAX Score II provides
   enhanced prognostic discrimination in this population, and may be a
   useful tool to guide resource allocation as well.}},

Abstract = {{The article deals with the validity of judgements in civil and
   administrative cases on the basis of the analysis of the Civil
   Procedural Code of the Russian Federation, the Administrative Court
   Procedure Code of the Russian Federation, the Civil and Family Codes of
   the Russian Federation. The importance of judgement as an act of justice
   can be explained by the aim to arrange and stabilize substantive ties. A
   judgement can perform such function when court's findings will be valid
   for the subjects of substantive relations. The institution of
   judgement's validity comprises three components characterizing its
   essence: a) concept (or content) of validity; b) the effective time of
   validity; c) objective and subjective limits of validity. The validity
   of judgement from the viewpoint of its inner content is a set of such
   its characteristics (or qualities) which ensure the stability of proven
   facts and legal relations as well as the protection of violated
   (contested) rights, freedoms and legal interests of substantive
   relations.
   The validity of judgement has such characteristics as invariability,
   cogency, exclusivity, prejudicialness, bindingness, enforceability. The
   invariability of a judgement means such a quality of its validity which
   makes a judgement final and unalterable by means of a prohibition
   against its changes and reverse after it came into force. The cogency of
   a valid judgement implies a prohibition addressed to those involved in a
   trial against appealing it. Exclusivity is such a property of a valid
   judgement that ensures stability of court's findings by means of
   prohibition against a repeated claim by the parties to a trial and a
   repeated hearing by court. Being a property of a valid judgement,
   prejudicialness is a bilaterally binding prohibition addressed to the
   court and parties to a trial against another estimation and litigation
   of the facts and legal relations in other civil or administrative
   trials. The bindingness of a valid judgement is a quality which ensures
   the stability, firmness and irreversibility of it in non-procedural
   sphere i.e. beyond the limits of concrete legal relations within the
   frame of which the given judgement was passed. Being a characteristic of
   a valid judgement, enforceability ensures its stability by procedural
   means and ways, by voluntary or forced realization of authoritative
   prescriptions contained in the judgement.
   The effective time of judgement depends on its appealing. The objective
   limits of judgement's validity are restricted by the framework of an
   adjudicated case. The subjective limits are, as a rule, restricted by
   the scope of persons involved in a case.}},

Title = {{Maternal healthcare in context: A qualitative study of women's tactics
   to improve their experience of public healthcare in rural Burkina Faso}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{98-104}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Improving the use of public maternal health facilities to prevent
   maternal death is a priority in developing countries. Accumulating
   evidence suggests that a key factor in choosing a facility-based
   delivery is the collaboration and the communication between healthcare
   providers and women. This article attempts to provide a fine-grained
   understanding of health system deficiencies, healthcare provider
   practices and women's experiences with maternal public healthcare.
   This article presents findings from ethnographic research conducted in
   the Central-East Region of Burkina Faso over a period of eight months
   (January-August 2013). It is based on monthly interviews with 14 women
   from village (10) and town (4) and on structured observations of
   clinical encounters in three primary healthcare facilities (two rural
   and one urban) (23 days). In addition, 13 health workers were
   interviewed and 11 focus groups with women from village (6) and town (5)
   were conducted (48 participants).
   Guided by an analytic focus on strategies and tactics and drawing on
   recent discussions on the notion of `biomedical security', the article
   explores what tactics women employ in their efforts to maximize their
   chances of having a positive experience with public maternal healthcare.
   The synthesis of the cases shows that, in a context of poverty and
   social insecurity, women employ five tactics: establishing good
   relations with health workers, being mindful of their `health booklet',
   attending prenatal care consultations, minimizing the waiting time at
   the maternity unit and using traditional medicines. In this way, women
   strive to achieve biomedical security for themselves and their child and
   to preserve their social reputation. The study reveals difficulty in the
   collaboration and communication between health workers and women and
   suggests that greater attention should be paid to social relations
   between healthcare providers and users. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe complexity of treatment regimens, costs and pill burden
   decrease the medication adherence and contribute to shortfall in
   cardiovascular preventive drug coverage. The polypill, a fixed dose
   combination pill of established drugs, is expected to increase adherence
   and reduce the costs whilst preventing major cardiovascular events
   (MCVE). Design and methodsThe PolyIran trial is a pragmatic cluster
   randomized trial nested within the Golestan Cohort Study (GCS). Subjects
   were randomized to either non-pharmacological preventive interventions
   alone (minimal care arm) or together with a polypill (polypill arm)
   comprising hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, atorvastatin and either
   enalapril or valsartan. This study benefits from the infrastructure of
   the primary health care system in Iran and the interventions are
   delivered by the local auxiliary health workers (Behvarz) to the
   participants. The primary outcome of the study is the occurrence of
   first MCVE within five years defined as non-fatal and fatal myocardial
   infarction, unstable angina, sudden death, heart failure, coronary
   artery revascularization procedures, and non-fatal and fatal stroke.
   Trial statusFrom February 2011 to April 2013, 8410 individuals (236
   clusters) attended the eligibility assessment. Of those, 3421 in the
   polypill arm and 3417 in the minimal care arm were eligible. The study
   is ongoing. ConclusionThe infrastructure of GCS and the primary health
   care system in Iran enabled the conduct of this pragmatic large-scale
   trial. If the polypill strategy proves effective, it may be implemented
   to prevent cardiovascular disease in developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{The applied science model of teacher education implies that the
   relationship between theory and practice is unidirectional. In this
   study, however, the researchers make a case in the opposite direction,
   i.e., they believe that professional practice can also shed some light
   on theories of language teaching. Since narrative inquiry is best for
   capturing the detailed stories or life experiences of a single life, the
   researchers took it as a legitimate mode of research to uncover and make
   sense of the professional experience of an experienced and
   professionally popular language teacher. Analysis revealed six themes,
   which reflect the participant's professional beliefs. Among other
   things, she believes that optimizing teaching practice depends on
   maximizing learner involvement, focusing on responsive teaching, leaving
   room for practice, and personalizing practice. The study has clear
   implications for practitioners and teacher educators.}},

Abstract = {{Several gap junction connexins have been shown to be essential for
   appropriate placental development and function. It is known that the
   expression and distribution of connexins change in response to
   environmental oxygen levels. The placenta develops under various oxygen
   levels, beginning at a low oxygen tension of approximately 2\% and
   increasing to a tension of 8\% after the onset of the uteroplacental
   circulation. Moreover, it has been shown that during preeclampsia (PE)
   placentas are subjected to chronic hypoxia. Therefore, we investigated
   oxygen sensitivity of placental connexins 43 and 46. Using the
   trophoblast cell line Jar, we demonstrated that the expression of
   connexin43 increased during acute hypoxia but decreased during chronic
   hypoxia. Chronic hypoxia resulted in the translocation of connexin43
   from the membrane to the cytoplasm and in a reduction in its
   communication properties. In contrast, the expression of connexin46 was
   down-regulated during chronic hypoxia and was translocated from
   perinuclear areas to the cell membrane. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)
   knockdown showed that the translocation of connexin43 but not that of
   connexin46 was HIF-2 dependent and was mediated by phosphoinositide
   3-kinase. The up-regulation of connexin43 in combination with the
   down-regulation of connexin46 was confirmed in placental explants
   cultivated under low oxygen and in placentas with early-onset PE. Taken
   together, in Jar cells, placental connexins 43 and 46 are regulated
   during periods of low oxygen in opposite manners. The oxygen sensing of
   connexins in the trophoblast may play a role in physiological and
   pathophysiological oxygen conditions and thus may contribute to PE. J.

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the acquisition digital rectal examination (DRE)
   skills by medical students through an alternative teaching method.
   Materials and methods: Medical students at the National Cheng-Kung
   University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan in 2009 were assigned to receive
   training through supervised rectal examination (DRE) with real-time
   feedback in a transrectal sonography room during their standard urologic
   rotation. Students completed a questionnaire (before and after the
   training) regarding their experiences in performing DRE to assess their
   confidence levels. Direct observation of practical skills (DOPS) was
   used to assess the students' competence in performing DRE at the end of
   urologic rotation.
   Results: A total of 75 students received the questionnaire, of which 72
   (96\%) responded. On average, every student had an experience of 6.6
   supervised patient examinations with real-time feedback in a transrectal
   sonography room. Following the training, students were more confident in
   their ability to give an opinion based on their findings related to DRE.
   The overall rate of the students' ability to interpret the DRE findings
   after urologic rotation improved from 69\% to 100\% for identification
   of the prostate, from 14\% to 60\% for assessment of prostate size, from
   32\% to 95\% to describe prostate consistency accurately, and from 9.8\%
   to 64\% to identify overt prostate cancer from benign prostate
   hyperplasia. All students met expectations or were above expectations
   according to the grading scale of performing DOPS.
   Conclusion: Students' skills and confidence with regard to performing
   DRE were improved significantly through supervised examination with
   real-time feedback in a transrectal sonography room. Copyright (C) 2014,

Abstract = {{Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of
   developmental pathways. However, their roles in human cardiac precursor
   cell (CPC) remain unexplored. To characterize the long noncoding
   transcriptome during human CPC cardiac differentiation, we profiled the
   lncRNA transcriptome in CPCs isolated from the human fetal heart and
   identified 570 lncRNAs that were modulated during cardiac
   differentiation. Many of these were associated with active cardiac
   enhancer and super enhancers (SE) with their expression being correlated
   with proximal cardiac genes. One of the most upregulated lncRNAs was a
   SE-associated lncRNA that was named CARMEN, (CAR)diac (M)esoderm
   (E)nhancer-associated (N)oncoding RNA. CARMEN exhibits RNA-dependent
   enhancing activity and is upstream of the cardiac mesoderm-specifying
   gene regulatory network. Interestingly, CARMEN interacts with SUZ12 and
   EZH2, two components of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). We
   demonstrate that CARMEN knockdown inhibits cardiac specification and
   differentiation in cardiac precursor cells independently of MIR-143 and
   -145 expression, two microRNAs located proximal to the enhancer
   sequences. Importantly, CARMEN expression was activated during
   pathological remodeling in the mouse and human hearts, and was necessary
   for maintaining cardiac identity in differentiated cardiomyocytes. This
   study demonstrates therefore that CARMEN is a crucial regulator of
   cardiac cell differentiation and homeostasis. (c) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{In the tropical rainforest at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica,
   regional bedrock groundwater high in dissolved carbon discharges into
   some streams and wetlands, with the potential for multiple cascading
   effects on ecosystem carbon pools and fluxes. We investigated carbon
   dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) degassing from two streams at La Selva:
   the Arboleda, where approximately one third of the streamflow is from
   regional groundwater, and the Taconazo, fed exclusively by local
   groundwater recharged within the catchment. The regional groundwater
   inflow to the Arboleda had no measurable effect on stream gas exchange
   velocity, dissolved CH4 concentration, or CH4 emissions but
   significantly increased stream CO2 concentration and degassing. CO2
   evasion from the reach of the Arboleda receiving regional groundwater
   (lower Arboleda) averaged 5.5molCm(-2)d(-1), similar to 7.5 times higher
   than the average (0.7molCm(-2)d(-1)) from the stream reaches with no
   regional groundwater inflow (the Taconazo and upper Arboleda). Carbon
   emissions from both streams were dominated by CO2; CH4 accounted for
   only 0.06-1.70\% of the total (average of both streams:
   5x10(-3)molCm(-2)d(-1)). Annual stream degassing fluxes normalized by
   watershed area were 48 and 299gCm(-2) for the Taconazo and Arboleda,
   respectively. CO2 degassing from the Arboleda is a significant carbon
   flux, similar in magnitude to the average net ecosystem exchange
   estimated by eddy covariance. Examining the effects of catchment
   connections to underlying hydrogeological systems can help avoid
   overestimation of ecosystem respiration and advance our understanding of
   carbon source/sink status and overall terrestrial ecosystem carbon
   budgets.}},

Abstract = {{An outbreak of acute gastroenteritis occurred at a restaurant in
   Yokohama in December 2011. Because many of the customers had consumed
   raw sea snail, sea snail was suspected to be the source of this
   outbreak. To determine whether sea snail contains Norovirus (NoV) or
   Sapovirus (SaV), we analyzed 27 sea snail samples collected over 5
   months (May, June, August, October, and December 2012) and 59.3 \% were
   positive for NoV and/or SaV. The levels of NoV ranged from 1.5 x 10(3)
   to 1.5 x 10(5) copies/g tissue, and those of SaV from 1.5 x 10(2) to 1.3
   x 10(3) copies/g tissue. The highest levels were observed in sea snails
   collected in December. A phylogenetic analysis of the NoVs showed that
   the viral strains were NoV genotypes GI.4, GI.6, GII.4, GII.12, GII.13,
   and GII.14, and the SaV strains were genotypes GI.2 and GI.3. The NoV
   GII.4 Sydney 2012 variants were only detected in December. This variant
   was a major source of gastroenteritis in Japan in the winter of
   2012/2013. In contrast, the NoV GII.4 strains detected in May and June
   2012 were not the Sydney 2012 variant. This study demonstrates that sea
   snail contains multiple genogroups and genotypes of NoV and SaV strains.
   We conclude that the sea snail presents a risk of gastroenteritis when
   consumed raw.}},

Abstract = {{We present a hybrid pneumatic/flexible sandwich structure with
   thermoplastic (TP) nanocomposite skins to enable the morphing of a
   nacelle inlet lip. The design consists of pneumatic inflatables as
   actuators and a flexible sandwich panel that morphs under variable
   pressure combinations to adapt different flight conditions and save
   fuel. The sandwich panel forms the outer layer of the nacelle inlet lip.
   It is lightweight, compliant and impact resistant with no
   discontinuities, and consists of graphene-doped thermoplastic
   polyurethane (G/TPU) skins that are supported by an aluminium Flex-core
   honeycomb in the middle, with near zero in-plane Poisson's ratio
   behaviour. A test rig for a reduced-scale demonstrator was designed and
   built to test the prototype of morphing nacelle with custom-made
   pneumatic actuators. The output force and the deflections of the
   experimental demonstrator are verified with the internal pressures of
   the actuators varying from 0 to 0.41 MPa. The results show the
   feasibility and promise of the hybrid inflatable/nanocomposite sandwich
   panel for morphing nacelle airframes.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the effect of percutaneous access site on the
   success and complication rates of isolated calyceal stones.
   Material and methods: We retrospectively evaluated 2700 patients who
   underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) in our clinic between
   October 2002 and August 2014. We selected only the patients with
   isolated lower, middle or upper calyceal stones and we grouped the
   patients according to the location of their stones. Successful operation
   was defined as complete stone clearence or retention of stone fragments
   smaller than 4 mm which do not lead to infection, obstruction or pain
   requiring treatment. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were
   also recorded.
   Results: Totally 360 patients underwent PNL for their isolated upper,
   middle and lower calyceal stones. Access sites for those patients were
   selected based on stone location. The stones were localized in the lower
   (n=304), middle (n=14), and upper (n=42) calices. There was no
   statistically significant difference between the groups with respect to
   operation and scopy times. Hemoglobin drop was seen more frequently in
   the upper calyceal access group, without any significant intergroup
   difference. Thoracic complications including hemothorax, pneumothorax
   and pleural effusion were more common in the upper calyceal access group
   (11.9\%; p<0.001). Complete stone clerance was accomplished in 81.9\%,
   92.9\% and 78.6\% of the patients with lower, middle and upper calyceal
   stones respectively without any significant intergroup difference
   (p=0.537).
   Conclusion: PNL is an effective and safe treatment modality for isolated
   calyceal kidney stones and upper calyceal access causes thoracic
   complications more than other access sites.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of carvacrol at different levels (0.1\%, 0.5\%, and 1\%) on

   monocytogenes, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Salmonella Paratyphi A) was
   studied using a rapid high-performance liquid chromatography method.
   Significant differences among bacteria (P < 0.05) in AMN and BA
   production were observed using a tyrosine decarboxylase broth. Tyramine,
   dopamine, agmatine, spermine, and putrescine were the main amines
   produced by the bacteria. Tyramine production by P. aeruginosa was the
   highest (967 mg/L), whereas K. pneumoniae was the poorest tyramine
   producer (6.42 mg/L). AMN and BA production varied significantly
   depending on carvacrol levels and the specific bacterial strains.
   Tyramine production for all bacterial strains was significantly
   suppressed by addition of carvacrol at levels of 0.5\% and 1\%, but not
   0.1\%. Consequently, the effect of carvacrol on BA and AMN formation by
   FBP was dependent on bacterial strain as well as carvacrol level.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The purpose of this study was to estimate the rate of
   incomplete fetal anatomic surveys during a second-trimester scan due to
   an unfavorable fetal position in a nonobese population.
   Methods All pregnant women who came to the Altamedica Fetal-Maternal
   Medical Center, a specialized center for prenatal diagnosis, for a
   routine second-trimester scan between January 2012 and April 2013 were
   retrospectively included in the analysis. Patients with a body mass
   index higher than 30.0 kg/m(2) or anterior fibroids larger than 5 cm
   were not included in the study.
   Results Of 4000 pregnant women admitted for a second-trimester scan,
   169(4.2\%) came back within 2 weeks to complete the examination because
   of an unfavorable fetal position. In particular, 104(2.6\%) needed
   visualization of only 1 view, and 65 (1.6\%) needed more than 1 view.
   The most difficult organ to visualize was the corpus callosum, in 73
   cases (1.8\%); the face was not visualized in 69 cases (1.7\%); the
   cerebellar vermis was not seen in 47 fetuses (1.1\%); and the heart
   could not be completely examined in 40 fetuses (1.0\%). Of the 4000
   women, 169 (4.2\%) had a nonexhaustive scan; 149 (3.7\%) needed a second
   scan to complete the second-trimester survey; 14(0.35\%) needed a third
   scan; and 2 (0.05\%) remained with a not completely exhaustive scan.
   Conclusions There is always a small percentage of incomplete fetal
   anatomic surveys during a second-trimester scan, which cannot be
   modified by the sonographer's skill or by technical sonographic
   innovations.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The notion of material stability is examined in the context of active
   muscle tissue modeling, where the nonlinear constitutive law is
   dependent both on the physiologically driven muscle contraction and
   finite mechanical deformation. First, the governing equations and
   constitutive laws for a general active-elastic material with a single
   preferred direction are linearized about a homogeneous underlying
   configuration with respect to both the active contraction and
   deformation gradient. In order to obtain mathematical restrictions
   analogous to those found in elastic materials, stability conditions are
   derived based on the propagation of homogeneous plane waves with real
   wave speeds, and the generalized acoustic tensor is obtained. Focusing
   on 2D motions, and considering a simplified, decoupled transversely
   isotropic energy function, the restriction on the active acoustic tensor
   is recast in terms of a generally applicable constitutive law, with
   specific attention paid to the fiber contribution. The implication of
   the material stability conditions on material parameters, active
   contraction, and elastic stretch is investigated for prototype material
   models of muscle tissue.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive analysis of the vitamin D status of infertile women is
   the first step in understanding hypovitaminosis impact on reproductive
   potential. We sought to determine vitamin D profiles of women attending
   an infertility center and to investigate non-dietary determinants of
   vitamin D status in this population. In this cross-sectional analysis, a
   cohort of 1072 women (mean age +/- standard deviation 36.3 +/- 4.4
   years) attending an academic infertility center was used to examine
   serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in relation to demographic
   characteristics, seasons and general health risk factors. Both
   unadjusted and adjusted levels of serum 25(OH)D were examined. Median
   25(OH)D concentration was below 30 ng/mL for 89\% of the entire year.
   Over the whole year, 6.5\% of patients had 25(OH)D levels 10 ng/mL,
   40.1\% 20 ng/mL, and 77.4\% 30 ng/mL. Global solar radiation was weakly
   correlated with 25(OH)D levels. At multivariable analysis, 25(OH)D
   levels were inversely associated with BMI; conversely, 25(OH)D levels
   were positively associated with height and endometriosis history. Serum
   25(OH)D levels are highly deficient in women seeking medical help for
   couple's infertility. Levels are significantly associated with body
   composition, seasonal modifications and causes of infertility.
   Importantly, this deficiency status may last during pregnancy with more
   severe consequences.}},

Abstract = {{A model intended to minimize the variability in the productive process
   is described. Structured in the four phases of the Deming cycle, the
   model incorporated the online quality engineering to the current
   practices of the concentrated vegetable pulp industrial process. Based
   on the analysis of the factors inherent to the process, the variability
   in the raw material of the various providers was identified as the main
   cause of the instability in the physicochemical quality characteristics
   of the final product. To cope with this problem, the puree design was
   adapted by reformulating pulp mixtures so as to guarantee its
   insensibility to the variability initially introduced. The robustness of
   the process was achieved with the stability of the product's
   characteristics: consistency and acidity. This result had repercussions
   on the process efficiency as proven by the decrease in the value of the
   loss function, sign of the validity of the model to improve a productive
   process by minimizing variability.}},

Abstract = {{Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is a highly sensitive technique for
   investigating the dielectric and optical properties of dielectrics at
   metal-dielectric interface. In the present article, the dielectric
   properties of various wide band gap (WBG) semiconductor have been
   studied using SPR technique at different wavelengths. The metal oxide
   thin films of interest are tungsten oxide (WO3), tin oxide (SnO2) and
   zinc oxide (ZnO) which were deposited by rf magnetron sputtering under
   optimized growth conditions. Gold coated glass prisms have been
   utlilized to excite the surface plasmon waves at the metal-dielectric
   (air) interface. When metal oxide thin films are integrated with the
   surface of metal thin film, a significant shift in the SPR curve has
   been observed due to change in the propagation constant of Surface
   Plasmon Wave (SPW) at metal-dielectric interface. The optical and
   dielectric parameters of WBG thin films were estimated by fitting
   experimental SPR data with the Fresnel's equations. SPR reflectance
   curves obtained using laser of various wavelengths were ultilized to
   determine the wavelength dispersion of the dielectric properties of
   these metal oxide thin films.}},

Abstract = {{Innate-like B1a lymphocytes arise from long-lived progenitors produced
   exclusively by fetal stem cells. Any insults coinciding with this early
   lymphopoietic wave could have a permanent impact on the B1a population
   and its unique protein products, the natural antibodies (NAb). We
   investigated early life nutritional influences on NAb concentrations of
   pre-adolescent children (n=290) in rural Nepal for whom we had extensive
   information on exposures from pregnancy and early infancy. Infant size
   and growth were strongly associated with NAb concentrations at 9-13
   years of age among males (e.g., for neonatal weight: beta(BOYS)=0.43;
   P<0.001), but not females (e.g., for neonatal weight: beta(GIRLS)=-0.16;
   P=0.26). In females, season of birth was associated with NAb
   concentrations, with marked reductions among girls born during the
   pre-monsoon (March-May; (GIRLS)=-0.39; P=0.01) and pre-harvest
   (September-November; beta(GIRLS)=-0.35; P=0.03) seasons. Our findings
   suggest that nutritional or other environmental influences on immune
   development may vary by sex, with potential consequences for immune
   function during infancy and long-term risk of immune-mediated disease.}},

Abstract = {{In recent studies, innovative high-pressure high-temperature processing
   (HPHT) has presented itself as an interesting alternative for furan
   reduction in sterilized, vegetable-based foods. In order to explain the
   observed furan reduction following HPHT treatment, furan formation was
   studied under a range of pressure, temperature and time conditions,
   using spinach puree as a case study. For all the treatments, no furan
   was detected during the dynamic heating-up phase, followed by a steady
   increase in furan concentrations at isothermal(-isobaric) conditions.
   The increase in furan concentrations at isothermal(-isobaric) treatment
   conditions could be adequately described by an empirical, zero-order
   model. A pressure level of 600 MPa did not affect the rate of furan
   formation in spinach puree, as opposed to the processing temperature and
   time. As a result, the reduced furan concentrations for HPHT processing
   could be explained by the faster heating and cooling rates, resulting in
   shorter processing times as compared with conventional retort
   processing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we extend the movable type (MT) sampling method to
   molecular conformational searches (MT-CS) on the free energy surface of
   the molecule in question. Differing from traditional systematic and
   stochastic searching algorithms, this method uses Boltzmann energy
   information to facilitate the selection of the best conformations. The
   generated ensembles provided good coverage of the available
   conformational space including available crystal structures.
   Furthermore, our approach directly provides the solvation free energies
   and the relative gas and aqueous phase free energies for all generated
   conformers. The method is validated by a thorough analysis of thrombin
   ligands as well as against structures extracted from both the Protein
   Data Bank (PDB) and the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). An in-depth
   comparison between OMEGA and MT-CS is presented to illustrate the
   differences between the two conformational searching strategies, i.e.,
   energy-based versus free energy-based searching. These studies
   demonstrate that our MT-based ligand conformational search algorithm is
   a powerful approach to delineate the conformational ensembles of
   molecular species on free energy surfaces.}},

   Feedback}},
Journal = {{IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we report a novel single-mode laser with high immunity to
   external optical feedback following the principle of active-filter-tuned
   oscillator. Within the conventional Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity, a high-Q
   bandpass filter formed by two tilted gratings with detuned Bragg
   wavelengths is embedded, and the resultant mode selection mechanism can
   purify the lasing spectrum by eliminating all but one of the FP cavity
   modes near the peak wavelength of the said filter. The proposed laser
   inherently bears the distinct feature of being robust against any small
   disturbances to oscillation loop. Simulation results from the
   large-signal dynamic model show that a stable single-mode operation has
   been achieved with a side-mode suppression ratio of as high as 50 dB.
   Further, compared with conventional index-coupled distributed feedback
   lasers, the proposed laser exhibits a much higher immunity to external
   optical feedback, even at a very high feedback level of -3 dB, and its
   single-mode yield is also less susceptible to variations of effective
   facet phases caused by cleaving in semiconductor laser fabrications.}},

Abstract = {{The global consumption of beer is increasing and consumers are
   interested in varieties rather than the only traditional beer prepared
   from malted barley; hence, it is necessary to search for unique
   potential substrates for beer production. The current study focuses on
   the preparation technology and the biochemical and sensory
   characteristics of beer samples by using purple sweet potato (PSP)
   (Ipomoea batatas L.) flakes as ingredient. Anthocyanin-rich beer was
   developed by fermenting a combination of PSP flakes and grist (crushed
   malt) prepared from barley through Saccharomyces cerevisiae without
   altering the originality of beer preparation. Among the beer samples
   (prepared from 0, 30, 50 and 100\% PSP flakes as adjunct), the beer
   prepared from 30\% PSP flakes + 70\% grist was the best as recommended
   by the sensory panelists, followed by the beer prepared from 50\% PSP
   flakes + 50\% grist. The beer prepared with 30\% PSP flakes had the
   following compositions: total soluble solids, 3.57 degrees Brix; starch,
   0.77 g/100 mL; total sugar, 6.93 g/100 mL; specific gravity, 1.02; pH,
   3.05; titratable acidity, 0.76 g tartaric acid/100 mL; lactic acid, 0.10

   3.77\% (v/v) and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging
   activity, 6.31\% at a dose of 250 mu g/mL. Strong loading of anthocyanin
   pigment (+ ve), phenol (+ ve) and the DPPH scavenging activity (+ ve) on

Abstract = {{Macrotyloma uniflorum Lam. (Verdc.) known as horse gram is an
   underutilized and unexplored food legume distributed throughout Asia and
   Africa. Its seeds are rich in phenolic acids, p-coumaric acid being the
   most abundant phenolic acid. The present study evaluates the antiulcer
   and antioxidant activity of the hydroalcoholic extract of the seeds of
   M. uniflorum (MUSE) and p-coumaric acid against indomethacin
   (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and absolute ethanol (necrotizing
   agent) induced ulcers in rats. Pre-treatment with MUSE and p-coumaric
   acid showed a dose-dependent decrease in the ulcer index in both models.
   MUSE and p-coumaric acid elicited significant antioxidant activity by
   attenuating the ulcer elevated levels of malondialdehyde and restored
   the ulcer-depleted levels of reduced glutathione and the antioxidant
   enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and
   glutathione reductase. In conclusion, MUSE possesses potent antiulcer
   activity which may be attributed to an underlying antioxidant activity.

Abstract = {{The extraction of chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) tensors of protons
   either directly bonded to N-14 nuclei (I = 1) or lying in their vicinity
   using rotor-synchronous recoupling pulse sequence is always fraught with
   difficulty due to simultaneous recoupling of N-14-H-1 heteronuclear
   dipolar couplings and the lack of methods to efficiently decouple these
   interactions. This difficulty mainly arises from the presence of large
   N-14 quadrupolar interactions in comparison to the rf field that can
   practically be achieved. In the present work it is demonstrated that the
   application of on-resonance N-14-H-1 decoupling with rf field strength
   similar to 30 times weaker than the N-14 quadrupolar coupling during H-1
   CSA recoupling under ultrafast MAS (90 kHz) results in CSA lineshapes
   that are free from any distortions from recoupled N-14-H-1 interactions.
   With the use of extensive numerical simulations we have shown the
   applicability of our proposed method on a naturally abundant r-Histidine

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The isolated forearm technique enables a patient, otherwise paralysed by
   neuromuscular blockade, to communicate by movement if wakeful during
   surgery. The positive response rate to verbal command is high (similar
   to 32\%). The 5th National Audit Project recommended that this
   monitoring technique should become more widely taught and considered, so
   this study was designed to assess its utility as a standard of care in
   unparalysed patients. A positive response rate as high as in the
   paralysed would justify local adoption. Therefore, 100 consecutive
   patients undergoing urology surgery were given verbal commands to move
   at two-minute intervals from induction of anaesthesia (fentanyl and
   propofol) to full emergence and extubation of the supraglottic airway.
   Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen/nitrous oxide.
   Although 24 patients moved during surgery (and therefore needed
   additional anaesthetic), none moved to verbal command. Even at
   extubation, when patients moved to expel the airway, there was no
   response to command until after wakening. These results suggest that in
   contrast to its use in paralysed patients, the isolated forearm
   technique does not yield useful information about the patient's state of
   wakefulness in the unparalysed. Another interpretation is that
   unparalysed patients are less prone to wakefulness than the paralysed.}},

   the best anticancer properties. However, while Cl-Irbb(16) was active
   against the metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells (3 mu M), it was relatively
   inactive against the nonmetastatic MCF-7 line (29 mu M). The three
   geometric isomers of Cl-Irbb(16) were isolated and characterised by NMR
   spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, and their anticancer activities,
   lipophilicities (logP) and DNA-binding abilities were examined. The
   trans, trans (t,t) isomer (IC50 = 2 mu M against MDA-MB-231) showed
   considerably greater anticancer activity than the cis, trans (c,t) and
   cis, cis (c, c) isomers (8 and 31 mu M, respectively). From logP
   measurements, the t, t isomer of Cl-Irbb(16) (logP = -0.62) was found to
   be slightly more lipophilic than the other geometric isomers (-0.95 and
   -0.98 for the c, c and c, t isomers, respectively). Calf-thymus (CT)
   DNA-binding experiments demonstrated that the t, t isomer did induce a
   different alteration to the helix conformation compared to the other
   isomers. The results of this study also high-light the significance of
   the differences in three-dimensional shape that can be obtained through
   geometric isomerism for octahedral coordination complexes.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the development of a computationally efficient
   algorithm for the offline identification of system parameters in
   nonlinear dynamical systems from noisy response measurements. The
   proposed methodology is built on the bootstrap particle filter available

   measurement equations are formulated in terms of the system parameters
   to be identified - treated as random variables, with all other
   parameters being considered as internal variables. Subsequently, the
   problem is transformed into a mathematical subspace spanned by a set of
   orthogonal basis functions obtained from polynomial chaos expansions of
   the unknown system parameters. The bootstrap filtering carried out in
   the transformed space enables identification of system parameters in a
   computationally efficient manner. The efficiency of the proposed
   algorithm is demonstrated through two numerical examples - a Duffing

   oscillating airfoil in an unsteady flow. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH

Abstract = {{We have shown previously that changes in LiaFSR, a three-component
   regulatory system predicted to orchestrate the cell membrane stress
   response, are important mediators of daptomycin (DAP) resistance in
   enterococci. Indeed, deletion of the gene encoding the response
   regulator LiaR in a clinical strain of Enterococcus faecalis reversed
   DAP resistance (DAP-R) and produced a strain hypersusceptible to
   antimicrobial peptides. Since LiaFSR is conserved in Enterococcus
   faecium, we investigated the role of LiaR in a variety of clinical E.
   faecium strains representing the most common DAP-R genetic backgrounds.
   Deletion of liaR in DAP-R E. faecium R446F (DAP MIC of 16 mu g/ml) and
   R497F (MIC of 24 mu g/ml; harboring changes in LiaRS) strains fully
   reversed resistance (DAP MICs decreasing to 0.25 and 0.094 mu g/ml,
   respectively). Moreover, DAP at concentrations of 13 mu g/ml (achieved
   with human doses of 12 mg/kg body weight) retained bactericidal activity
   against the mutants. Furthermore, the liaR deletion derivatives of these
   two DAP-R strains exhibited increased binding of boron-dipyrromethene
   difluoride (BODIPY)daptomycin, suggesting that high-level DAP-R mediated
   by LiaR in E. faecium involves repulsion of the calcium-DAP complex from
   the cell surface. In DAP-tolerant strains HOU503F and HOU515F (DAP MICs
   within the susceptible range but bacteria not killed by DAP
   concentrations of 5 x the MIC), deletion of liaR not only markedly
   decreased the DAP MICs (0.064 and 0.047 mu g/ml, respectively) but also
   restored the bactericidal activity of DAP at concentrations as low as 4
   mu g/ml (achieved with human doses of 4 mg/kg). Our results suggest that
   LiaR plays a relevant role in the enterococcal cell membrane adaptive
   response to antimicrobial peptides independent of the genetic background
   and emerges as an attractive target to restore the activity of DAP
   against multidrug-resistant strains.}},

Abstract = {{Pyoluteorin is an antifungal agent composed of a 4,5-dichlorinated
   pyrrole group linked to a resorcinol moiety. The pyoluteorin
   biosynthetic gene cluster in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 encodes the
   halogenase PltA, which has been previously demonstrated to perform both
   chlorinations in vitro. PltA selectively accepts as a substrate a
   pyrrole moiety covalently tethered to a nonribosomal peptide thiolation
   domain Pith (pyrrolyl-S-PltL) for FAD-dependent di-chlorination,
   yielding 4,5-dichloropyrrolyl-S-Plth We report a 2.75
   angstrom-resolution crystal structure of PltA in complex with FAD and
   chloride. PltA is a dimeric enzyme, containing a flavin-binding fold
   conserved in flavin-dependent halogenases and monooxygenases, and an
   additional unique helical region at the C-terminus. This C-terminal
   region blocks a putative substrate-binding cleft, suggesting that a
   conformational change involving repositioning of this region is
   necessary to allow binding of the pyrrolyl-S-Plth substrate for its
   dichlorination by PltA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We carried out a comprehensive literature review of the medicinal use of
   palms in northwestern South America and complemented it with a large
   number of field interviews. We investigated patterns of medicinal use
   across three ecoregions (Amazon, Andes, Choc), four countries (Colombia,
   Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia), and three human groups (indigenous, mestizos,
   and Afro-Americans). Overall, we reviewed 129 references with medicinal
   palm data and conducted 1956 field interviews, which yielded 93
   medicinal palm species, 924 uses for the treatment of 157 diseases and
   ailments, and 1553 use-reports. The Amazon ecoregion showed the highest
   incidence of medicinal use, but overall use patterns were similar to
   those in the Andes and the Choc. Ecuador was the most intensively
   studied country, whereas our fieldwork demonstrated that the Andes of
   all countries, and the Choc of Colombia could still yield more
   information. The most common medicinal uses were associated to Digestive
   system, Skin and subcutaneous tissue, Infections and infestations, and
   Respiratory system. The medicinal use of palms was clearly more
   prominent among the indigenous than amongst mestizos and Afro-Americans.
   Medicinal palm use was not random, but rather showed similar patterns
   across ecoregions and countries, covering the livelihoods and needs of
   primary health care, often unmet by Western health systems.}},

Title = {{Non-uniform plasma distribution in dc magnetron sputtering: origin,
   shape and structuring of spokes}},
Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Non-homogeneous plasma distribution in the form of organized patterns
   called spokes was first observed in high power impulse magnetron
   sputtering (HiPIMS). In the present work we investigate the spoke
   phenomenon in non-pulsed low-current dc magnetron sputtering (DCMS).
   Using a high-speed camera the spokes were systematically studied with
   respect to discharge current, pressure, target material and magnetic
   field strength. Increase in the discharge current and/or gas pressure
   resulted in the sequential formation of two, then three and more spokes.
   The observed patterns were reproducible for the same discharge
   conditions. Spokes at low currents and pressures formed an elongated
   arrowhead-like shape and were commonly arranged in symmetrical patterns.
   Similar spoke patterns were observed for different target materials.
   When using a magnetron with a weaker magnetic field, spokes had an
   indistinct and diffuse shape, whereas in stronger magnetic fields spokes
   exhibited an arrowhead-like shape.
   The properties of spokes are discussed in relation to the azimuthally
   dependent electron-argon interactions. It is suggested that a single
   spoke is formed due to local gas breakdown and subsequent electron drift
   in the azimuthal direction. The spoke is self-sustained by electrons
   drifting in complex electric and magnetic fields that cause and govern
   azimuthally dependent processes: ionization, sputtering, and secondary
   electron emission. In this view plasma evolves from a single spoke into
   different patterns when discharge conditions are changed either by the
   discharge current, pressure or magnetic field strength. The azimuthal
   length of the spoke is associated with the electron-Ar collision
   frequency which increases with pressure and results in shortening of
   spoke until an additional spoke forms at a particular threshold
   pressure. It is proposed that the formation of additional spokes at
   higher pressures and discharge currents is, in part, related to the
   increased transport of charge towards the central part of the magnetron.}},

Title = {{A comparison of non-biologically active truncated EGF (EGFt) and
   full-length hEGF for delivery of Auger electron-emitting In-111 to
   EGFR-positive breast cancer cells and tumor xenografts in athymic mice}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{42}},

Pages = {{931-938}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: EGFt is a truncated form of human epidermal growth factor
   (hEGF) that is non-biologically active but retains binding and
   internalization into EGFR-positive cells. Our aim was to compare EGFt
   and hEGF for delivery of In-111 to human breast cancer (BC) cells and
   tumors and evaluate its cytotoxicity against EGFR-positive BC cells,
   mediated by the Auger electron emissions of In-111.
   Methods: The binding, internalization and nuclear localization of EGFt
   and hEGF in MDA-MB-468 human BC cells were first assessed by confocal
   fluorescence microscopy. Subcellular fractionation was then used to
   quantify the cellular and nuclear uptake of In-111-EGFt and In-111-hEGF
   in MDA-MB-468 cells. The effect of exposure in vitro to In-111-EGFt or
   In-111-hEGF on the clonogenic survival of MDA-MB-468 (10(6) EGFR/cell)
   or MCF-7 cells (10(4) EGFR/cell) was determined. The pharmacokinetics
   and tumor and normal tissue biodistribution of In-111-EGFt was compared
   to In-111-hEGF in CD-1 athymic mice with s.c. MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7
   tumors. Nuclear importation in MDA-MB-468 tumors was determined ex vivo
   by subcellular fractionation.
   Results: Fluorescently-labeled EGFt and hEGF were bound, internalized
   and localized in the nucleus of MDA-MB-468 cells. Binding of In-111-EGFt
   to MDA-MB-468 cells was 8-fold lower than In-111-hEGF, but nuclear
   importation as a proportion of cell-bound In-111 was 3.6-fold greater
   than In-111-hEGF. Nuclear uptake of In-111-EGFt was lower than
   In-111-hEGF when differences in cell binding were taken into account.
   The cytotoxicity of In-111-EGFt (1.0 MBq/mL; 10 nmols/L) against
   MDA-MB-468 cells was 9-fold lower than In-111-hEGF but only 2-fold lower
   at a higher concentration (1.85 MBq/mL; 40 nmols/L). In-111-EGFt and
   In-111-hEGF exhibited greater cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-468 cells than
   MCF-7 cells. In-111-EGFt was eliminated more slowly from the blood of
   tumor-bearing mice and exhibited lower liver uptake but higher kidney
   accumulation. Uptake of In-111-EGFt in MDA-MB-468 tumors was 2.2-fold
   lower than In-111-hEGF, and was blocked by anti-EGFR monoclonal
   antibody, nimotuzumab. Nuclear uptake into MDA-MB-468 tumor cells was
   higher for In-111-EGFt than In-111-hEGF, but when the lower tumor uptake
   of In-111-EGFt was considered, there were no overall differences.
   Conclusion: We conclude that the absence of biological activity of EGFt
   makes it attractive for delivery of Auger electron-emitting In-111 to
   EGFR-overexpressing BC, but its lower cellular and tumor uptake would
   limit its effectiveness compared to In-111-hEGF.
   Advances in Knowledge and Implications for Patient Care: In-111-EGFt may
   reduce the adverse effects previously observed in patients administered
   In-111-hEGF since it is not biologically active, but its lower uptake by
   BC cells and tumors would limit its effectiveness for treatment of
   breast cancer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   shaft failed due to rotating bending fatigue initiated from the surface
   and close to the keyway area. The origin is located on a surface flaw
   (recess or dent) of approximately 100 lm depth, which could have
   probably being caused either during installation, operation, or
   maintenance. In addition, scoring lines formed due to friction-related
   processes and found on the journal surface were considered as stress
   raisers acting as potential sites for fatigue crack initiation. Careful
   review of the shaft service conditions and the implementation of
   suitable inspection procedures adapted to the vessel planned maintenance
   are recommended as necessary corrective actions for failure prevention.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are autoantibodies that
   increase the risk of women developing the hypertensive disorder
   pre-eclampsia. aPL are internalised by the syncytiotrophoblast and
   increase extrusion of necrotic multinucleated syncytial nuclear
   aggregates (SNAs), which may trigger endothelial dysfunction in
   pre-eclampsia. The mechanisms by which aPL alter death processes in the
   syncytiotrophoblast leading to extrusion of SNAs are unknown.
   Methods: First trimester human placentae (n = 10) were dissected into
   explants and cultured either with aPL (50 mu g/mL), isotype-matched
   control antibody (50 mu g/mL), or media for 24 h. Harvested SNAs
   underwent iTRAQ proteomic analysis. Mitochondria in syncytiotrophoblast
   treated with aPL labelled with FluoroNanogold were visualised using
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
   Results: aPL altered the expression of 72 proteins in SNAs. Thirteen
   proteins were involved in mitochondrial function. TEM demonstrated that
   aPL bind to mitochondria in the syncytiotrophoblast and may cause
   mitochondrial swelling.
   Discussion: aPL disrupt mitochondria increasing the extrusion of SNAs
   with an altered proteome from the syncytiotrophoblast These altered SNAs
   may trigger endothelial dysfunction and pre-eclampsia in these
   pregnancies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A study was undertaken for the evaluation of the pesticide pollution
   caused by the agricultural activities in the basin of Lake Vistonis,
   Greece during the years 2010-2012. Water samples were collected from
   Lake Vistonis, four major rivers and various small streams and
   agriculture drainage canals. The concentration of 302 compounds was
   determined after solid-phase extraction of the water samples and
   subsequent LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS analysis of the extracts. Overall,
   herbicides were the most frequently detected pesticides (57\%), followed
   by insecticides (28\%) and fungicides (14\%). In Lake Vistonis 11
   pesticides were detected. Specifically, fluometuron was detected in the
   75\% of the samples (maximum concentration 0.088 mu g/L) whereas
   lambdacyhalothrin was detected in all the samples of spring 2011 and
   alphamethrin in all the samples of spring 2012 (maximum concentration
   0.041 and 0.168 mu g/L, respectively). In the rivers and drainage canals
   68 pesticides were detected. Specifically, fluometuron was detected in
   the 53\% of the samples (maximum concentration 317.6 mu g/L) followed by
   chlorpyrifos and prometryn (16 and 13\% of the samples respectively). An
   environmental risk assessment was performed by employing the Risk
   Quotient (RQ) method. The risk assessment revealed that at least one
   pesticide concentration led to a RQ N 1 in 20\% of the samples. In Lake
   Vistonis, alphamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin concentrations resulted in
   RQ N 1, whereas in the other water bodies this was mainly the result of
   chlorpyrifos-methyl and alphamethrin exposure. In contrast, herbicide
   and fungicide concentrations contributed substantially less to
   environmental risks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The action-sentence compatibility effect (ACE; Glenberg \& Kaschak,
   2002), a hallmark finding in Embodied Cognition, implicates the motor
   system in language comprehension. In the ACE, people process sentences
   implying movement toward or away from themselves, responding with
   actions toward or away from their bodies. These processes interact,
   implying a linkage between linguistic and motor systems. From a
   theoretical perspective, the ACE has been extremely influential, being
   widely cited evidence in favor of embodied cognition. The present study
   began as an attempt to extend the ACE in a new direction, but eventually
   became a series of attempts to simply replicate the effect. Across 8
   experiments, I tested whether the ACE extends to a novel mouse-tracking
   method and/or is susceptible to higher-order cognitive influences. In 3
   experiments, attempts were made to ``disembody{''} the ACE by presenting
   participants' names on the computer screen (as in Markman \& Brendl,
   2005). In each experiment, the ACE could not be disembodied, because the
   ACE did not occur. In further experiments, the ACE was not observed in
   reading times, regardless of response mode (mouse movements vs.
   button-presses) or stimuli, including those from the original research.
   Similarly, no ACE was observed in physical movement times. Bayes Factor
   analyses of the current experiments, and the previous ACE literature,
   suggest that the evidence for the ACE is generally weak: Many studies
   considered as positive evidence actually support the null hypothesis,
   and very few published results offer strong evidence for the ACE.
   Implications for the embodiment hypothesis are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic yield of
   comparative genomic hybridization microarrays (aCGH) and compare it with
   conventional karyotype analysis of standard > 5-Mb resolution.
   Method A total of 1763 prenatal samples were analyzed by aCGH (CytoChip
   Focus Constitutional microarrays, BlueGnome, Cambridge). The diagnostic
   yield of chromosomal abnormalities detected by aCGH was assessed,
   compared with conventional karyotype analysis.
   Results The result was pathogenic/unknown penetrance in 125 cases
   (7.1\%), and a variant of unknown significance (VOUS) was detected in 13
   cases (0.7\%). Out of the 125 cases with abnormal findings, 110 were
   also detected by conventional karyotype analysis. The aCGH increment in
   diagnostic yield was 0.9\% (15/1763) and 1.6\% when VOUS were included.
   Stratifying the sample according to indications for prenatal invasive
   testing, the highest values of diagnostic yield increment were observed
   for patients positive for second-trimester sonographic markers (1.5\%)
   and for the presence of fetal structural anomalies (1.3\%). In contrast,
   the incremental yield was marginal in patients with fetus with increased
   nuchal translucency (0.5\%).
   Conclusion The present study indicates that routine implementation of
   aCGH offers an incremental yield over conventional karyotype analysis,
   which is also present in cases with `milder' indications, further
   supporting its use as a first-tier test. (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Diabetes adversely impacts many organ systems including the skeleton.
   Clinical trials have revealed a startling elevation in fracture risk in
   diabetic patients. Bone fractures can be life threatening: nearly 1 in 6
   hip fracture patients die within one year. Because physical exercise is
   proven to improve bone properties and reduce fracture risk in
   non-diabetic subjects, we tested its efficacy in type 1 diabetes. We
   hypothesized that diabetic bone's response to anabolic mechanical
   loading would be attenuated, partially due to impaired mechanosensing of
   osteocytes under hyperglycemia. Heterozygous C57BL/6-Ins2(Akita)/J
   (Akita) male and female diabetic mice and their age- and gender-matched
   wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J controls (7-month-old, N = 5-7 mice/group) were
   subjected to unilateral axial ulnar loading with a peak strain of 3500
   mu epsilon at 2 Hz and 3 min/day for 5 days. The Akita female mice,
   which exhibited a relatively normal body weight and a mild 40\%
   elevation of blood glucose level, responded with increased bone
   formation (+6.5\% in Ct.B.Ar, and 4 to 36-fold increase in Ec.BFR/BS and
   Ps.BFR/BS), and the loading effects, in terms of changes of static and
   dynamic indices, did not differ between Akita and WT females (p >= 0.1).
   However, loading-induced anabolic effects were greatly diminished in
   Akita males, which exhibited reduced body weight, severe hyperglycemia
   (+230\%), diminished bone formation (Delta Ct.B.Ar: 0.003 vs. 0.030
   mm(2), p = 0.005), and suppressed periosteal bone appositions (Delta
   Ps.BFR/BS, p = 0.02). Hyperglycemia (25 mM glucose) was further found to
   impair the flow-induced intracellular calcium signaling in MLO-Y4
   osteocytes, and significantly inhibited the flow-induced downstream
   responses including reduction in apoptosis and sRANKL secretion and
   PGE(2) release. These results, along with previous findings showing
   adverse effects of hyperglycemia on osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem
   cells, suggest that failure to maintain normal glucose levels may impair
   bone's responses to mechanical loading in diabetics. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this article, the author analyzes the evolution of the slam poetry
   movement in the Gatineau-Ottawa area. He describes the rapid evolution
   of slam performances from the first competitions in the United States in
   1975 to the appearance of competitive teams in Montreal and throughout
   Quebec and Ontario. Despite the geopolitical and linguistic boundaries
   that define the urban spaces of Gatineau and Ottawa, slammers-both
   Franco-Ontarian and Quebecois-move freely among the various slam venues.
   It seems relevant, therefore, to examine the slam scene in this region
   where internationally-known oral poets such as Marjolaine Beauchamp,
   Lise Careau, Pierre Cadieu and Mehdi Hamdad come to perform.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{During the last decades, medical paternalism was rejected in favour of
   the patient's right to self-determination and, by extension, to its
   right to consent or refuse care offered to him. In the clinical setting,
   the obligation to inform user and to obtain its free and informed
   consent about such care is widely recognized, but rarely problematized.
   The aim of this paper is to analyze the construct of ``consent to
   care{''} and the different conceptualizations of autonomy that are part
   of this juridical vehicle. A socio-legal analysis was conducted through
   a narrative review of literature relative to nursing sciences,
   humanities, philosophy and bioethics, and legal sciences. Although
   obtaining consent is often approached as a formality, this process is
   situated at the intersection of an interface that is both relational and
   personal. This perspective requires recognition of the intersubjective
   process that takes place between the user and the clinician, and of the
   negotiating space in which they both are situated. It is finally
   proposed to develop further researches addressing this phenomenon, and
   the actor-network theories would represent a potential epistemological
   perspective to do so.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine whether lesion stiffness measured by shear-wave
   elastography (SWE) can be used to predict the histologic underestimation
   of ultrasound (US)-guided 14-gauge core needle biopsy (CNB) for breast
   masses.
   Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 99 breast masses from 93
   patients, including 40 high-risk lesions and 59 ductal carcinoma in situ
   (DCIS), which were diagnosed by US-guided 14-gauge CNB. SWE was
   performed for all breast masses to measure quantitative elasticity
   values before US-guided CNB. To identify the preoperative factors
   associated with histologic underestimation, patients' age, symptoms,
   lesion size, B-mode US findings, and quantitative SWE parameters were
   compared according to the histologic upgrade after surgery using the
   chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, or independent t-test. The
   independent factors for predicting histologic upgrade were evaluated
   using multivariate logistic regression analysis.
   Results: The underestimation rate was 28.3\% (28/99) in total, 25.0\%
   (10/40) in high-risk lesions, and 30.5\% (18159) in DCIS. All elasticity
   values of the upgrade group were significantly higher than those of the
   non-upgrade group (P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, the mean (Odds
   ratio {[}OR] = 1.021, P = 0.001), maximum (OR= 1.015, P=0.008), and
   minimum (OR = 1.028, P = 0.001) elasticity values were independently
   associated with histologic underestimation. The patients' age, lesion
   size, and final assessment category on US of the upgrade group were
   higher than those of the non-upgrade group (P=0.046 for age; P=0.021 for
   lesion size; P=0.030 for US category), but these were not independent
   predictors of histologic underestimation on multivariate analysis.
   Conclusion: Breast lesion stiffness quantitatively measured by SWE could
   be helpful to predict the underestimation of malignancy in US-guided
   14-gauge CNB. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background Large-scale epidemiologic analysis for hematologic
   malignancies will be helpful to understand the trends in incidence and
   survival.
   Methods The Korea Central Cancer Registry (KCCR) updated the nationwide
   analysis on the incidence and survival of myeloid malignancies, from the
   Korean National Cancer Incidence Database between 1999 and 2012. Myeloid
   malignancies were classified based on the International Classification
   of Diseases for Oncology 3rd edition (ICD-O-3).
   Results Overall 3,771 cases of myeloid diseases, which was 1.7\% of all
   cancers, were identified in 2012. The highest incidence of myeloid
   malignancies was observed in age 70s and male predominance was noted
   (1.3: 1). Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was the most frequent subtype,
   followed by myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), myelodysplastic syndrome
   (MDS) and MDS/MPN: age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) in 2012 for
   each disease were 2.02, 1.95, 1.13, and 0.12 per 100,000 persons,
   respectively. The ASR for all myeloid malignancies was increased from
   3.31 in 1999 to 5.70 in 2012 with the annual percentage change (APC) of
   5.4 \%. Five-year relative survival rate (RS) for myeloid malignancies
   has gradually improved for decades. RS changed from 26.3\% to 34.8\% in
   AML, specifically from 51.6\% to 69.6\% in acute promyelocytic leukemia
   (APL) and from 23.8\% to 29.9\% in non-APL AML, between 1996-2000 and
   2008-2012. RS also increased from 81.8\% to 87.1\% in MPN, with a
   significant improvement in CML (from 74.5\% to 85.5\%), and from 27.3\%
   to 31.7\% in MDS/MPN between 2001-2005 and 2008-2012. However, there was
   no survival improvement in MDS during the study period (45.6\% in
   2001-2005 to 44.4\% in 2008-2012).
   Conclusion This report updated the nationwide statistical analysis on
   myeloid malignancies since 2008, showing increasing incidence and
   improving trends in survival.}},

Abstract = {{In the fierce competition at the global logistics markets, Korean
   logistics providers were deemed more vulnerable than global logistics
   providers in terms of the quality and price competitiveness. To
   strengthen their competitiveness, logistics providers in Korea have
   focused on delivering integrated logistics services. In this regard, the
   Korean government has enacted the ``Integrated Logistics Industry
   Certification Act{''}in 2006 to assist integrated logistics providers to
   offer logistics services based on their specialization and
   differentiation. It has been several years since the system was
   implemented, and the evaluation of the system implementation was
   necessary. Hence, in our study, we attempt to examine the efficiency and
   productivity of fourteen certified Korean logistics providers employing
   the DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) method with a five- year panel data
   since the inception of the Act. Through our static and dynamic analyses,
   We found that Pantos Logistics and HYUNDAI Glovis are running their
   businesses at the highest level of efficiency and Hanjin Transportation
   was the most stable company in their logistics operation. Copyright

Abstract = {{Traditionally, the superimposition of serial, two-dimensional
   cephalometric radiographs has been used for the evaluation of growth and
   treatment effects. Nowadays, the superimposition of cone-beam computed

   three-dimensional (3D) assessment of changes with growth or treatment.
   However, the assessment of changes with 3D image superimposition poses
   many challenges such as accuracy and reproducibility. Various methods
   for the reconstruction of 3D CBCT images have been used in diagnosis,
   treatment planning, and simulation. In this article, the various 3D CBCT
   superimposition techniques and relevant evidences are discussed.
   Furthermore, their clinical applications, benefits, and limitations are

   after the pronoun, cognate language, and terms of address were expressed
   in English, they became highly unnatural expressions in the Thai
   language or did not properly express family relationships, producing
   mistranslations. Regarding living customs, after the Korean customs and
   lifestyles with which Thai people are familiar were retranslated using
   poor vocabularies, they were translated into English, reducing
   equivalence. In the Ideas category, after traditional beliefs related to
   rites of passage-such as marriage or death-practiced by both Koreans and
   the Thai, and related world views, were translated directly into
   English, they were retranslated insufficiently or omitted. Lastly, in
   the Material category, after vocabularies related to Korean food
   culture-well known to the Thai-were translated into English,
   mistranslations and lack of equivalence resulted in ambiguous

Abstract = {{Sporting celebrities are rarely discussed within the broader realms of
   theological debate. Yet that is not to say that their identities cannot
   offer insight into wider patterns of cultural influence. Indeed, it is
   our contention within this paper that the reverse is true; that analyses
   of the autobiographical details of contemporary sporting figures
   represent key sites through which cultural influence can be examined. To
   this end, we take one sporting icon of recent times, American Football
   (NFL) star Tim Tebow and assess his popular cultural image in terms of
   its contribution to debates surrounding identity, Christianity and
   morality. Our central thesis is that whilst Tebow's popular cultural
   image affords all the hallmarks of modern-day `platform ministry', his
   articulation of particular norms and values raises questions about the
   kinds of moral responsibilities high-profile Christian athletes have in
   relation to their expressions of faith.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Iron-deficiency anemia is a major public health problem
   among school-aged children in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of micronutrient-fortified rice
   to increase hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and reduce the prevalence of
   anemia among schoolchildren.
   Methods: Nine hundred four schoolchildren participated in this
   cluster-randomized trial during a 7-month intervention period. The study
   was conducted in 12 primary schools in rural Burundi. Hemoglobin,
   socioeconomic status, febrile illness, and dietary diversity were
   measured at baseline and follow-up. The changes in Hb concentration and
   anemia status were analyzed using linear and logistic mixed models,
   respectively. The micronutrient formulation contained an iron-to-zinc
   molar ratio of approximately 2.2.
   Results: There was no significant difference in Hb concentration between
   the intervention and control groups (beta = .09 g/dL; 95\% confidence
   interval: -0.21 to 0.38) following the 7-month intervention. Nearly half
   the children reported having a fever within 2 weeks prior to baseline or
   follow-up. Children with febrile illness preceding follow-up were less
   than half as likely to show improvement in anemia status (odds ratio =
   0.47, P < .001), with an average 0.56 g/dL smaller improvement in Hb at
   follow-up (P < .001).
   Conclusion: The high prevalence of fever and low iron-to-zinc molar
   ratio of the Ultra Rice formulation may have contributed to the lack of
   improvement in Hb. Alternatively, the detected anemia may not have been
   due to nutrient deficiencies. Anemia interventions in Burundi should
   implement multiple strategies to eliminate both iron deficiency and
   infectious causes of anemia.}},

Abstract = {{Although various forms for the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds on the effective
   elastic properties of inhomogeneous materials have been written down
   over the last few decades, it is often unclear how to construct and
   compute such bounds when the material is not of simple type (e.g.
   isotropic spheres inside an isotropic host phase). Here, we show how to
   construct, in a straightforward manner, the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds for
   generally transversely isotropic two-phase particulate composites where
   the inclusion phase is spheroidal, and its distribution is governed by
   spheroidal statistics. Note that this case covers a multitude of
   composites used in applications by taking various limits of the
   spheroid, including both layered media and long unidirectional
   composites. Of specific interest in this case is the fact that the
   corresponding Eshelby and Hill tensors can be derived analytically. That
   the shape of the inclusions and their distribution can be specified
   independently is of great utility in composite design. We exhibit the
   implementation of the computations with several examples.}},

Abstract = {{In this essay, Anthony Parr examines Kevin Sharpe's trilogy on images of
   rule in the light of the New Historicist ``turn{''} in study of early
   modern culture. He considers the ways in which these three books take
   the Revisionist historical project into a post modern debate about
   whether the chronicle of the past can be described as any thing other
   than a set of competing narratives or representations, all of which are
   available to us only as texts or images. He finds Sharpe ultimately
   committed to a belief in historical evidence that yields a trove of
   information about all of the reigns examined but also raises questions
   about the focus on a conception of power and authority vested almost
   exclusively in the monarch. From the perspective of literary studies,
   this analysis of Sharpe's project asks where his study of historical
   representation might take us and how future work can avoid the
   intellectual cul-de-sacs of postmodern relativism and purely
   instrumental readings of literature.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the release of his birth certificate, some Americans express
   continued skepticism over whether Barack Obama was born in the United
   States. This study examined two possible causes of birther beliefs: that
   Republicans and conservatives, whose ideological beliefs and policy
   preferences led to disapproval of the president, might be particularly
   prone to accepting birther beliefs, and that negative attitudes toward
   Blacks led some Americans to disapprove of the President and accept
   foreign birthplace claims. A nationally representative survey of
   Americans showed that birther sentiments were predominant among
   conservatives/Republicans and individuals holding anti-Black attitudes.
   These relations were mediated by disapproval of the president. Hence, it
   appears that birther beliefs were motivated both by politically-grounded
   disapproval and racially-driven disapproval of the president. (C) 2014

   Environmental Engineering at Poznan University of Technology, new
   English-language specialty master studies - Construction Technology
   Management was launched in March 2014. Studies are based on the
   cooperation between the student, the industry and the university,
   allowing students to get to know the specifics of the construction
   industry. In addition, Poznan University of Technology is involved in an
   MBAIC project MBA in construction aimed at common study for
   postgraduates. The synergy achieved through the implementation of these
   two projects enables the possibility to educate construction managers
   capable of communication in English, possessing knowledge regarding
   innovation in the construction industry, who are well prepared to enter
   the labour market and have the possibility of subsequent improvement of
   managerial competences.}},

Abstract = {{Dramatic epigenetic changes take place during mammalian differentiation
   from the naive pluripotent state including the silencing of one of the
   two X chromosomes in female cells through X chromosome inactivation.
   Conversely, reprogramming of somatic cells to naive pluripotency is
   coupled to X chromosome reactivation (XCR). Recent studies in the mouse
   system have shed light on the mechanisms of XCR by uncovering the timing
   and steps of XCR during reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells
   (iPSCs), allowing the generation of testable hypotheses during
   embryogenesis. In contrast, analyses of the X chromosome in human iPSCs
   have revealed important differences between mouse and human
   reprogramming processes that can partially be explained by the
   establishment of distinct pluripotent states and impact disease modeling
   and the application of human pluripotent stem cells. Here, we review
   recent literature on XCR as a readout and determinant of reprogramming
   to pluripotency.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with OCD are impaired in multiple domains of functioning and
   quality of life. While associated psychopathology complaints and
   neuropsychological deficits were reported, the subjective experience of
   general fatigue and mental fatigue was scarcely investigated. In this
   single-center case-control study we compared 50 non-depressed OCD
   outpatients consecutively recruited and 50 panic disorder (PD)
   outpatients, to determine whether they experienced fatigue differently.
   Assessment consisted of structured clinical interview for DSM-IV
   criteria by using the SCID-I and the SCID-II. Symptom severity was
   assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, the Hamilton
   Anxiety Rating Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Clinical
   Global Impressions Scale, severity and the Global Assessment of
   Functioning Scale. Fatigue was assessed by using the Multidimensional
   Fatigue Inventory (MFI). Regarding MFI physical fatigue, an OR of 0.196
   (95 \% CI 0.080-0.478) was found, suggesting that its presence is
   associated with lower odds of OCD compared to PD. The same can be said
   for MFI mental fatigue, as an OR of 0.138 (95 \% CI 0.049-0.326) was
   found, suggesting that its presence is associated with lower odds of
   OCD. Notably, OCD patients with OCDP co-morbidity reported higher scores
   of mental fatigue. In this study fatigue, including mental fatigue,
   seems not to be a prominent experience among adult non-depressed OCD
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{In hypoxia, mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species not only
   stimulate accumulation of the transcriptional regulator of hypoxic gene
   expression, hypoxia inducible factor-1 (Hif-1), but also cause oxidative
   base modifications in hypoxic response elements (HREs) of
   hypoxia-inducible genes. When the hypoxia-induced base modifications are
   suppressed, Hif-1 fails to associate with the HRE of the VEGF promoter,
   and VEGF mRNA accumulation is blunted. The mechanism linking base
   modifications to transcription is unknown. Here we determined whether
   recruitment of base excision DNA repair (BER) enzymes in response to
   hypoxia-induced promoter modifications was required for transcription
   complex assembly and VEGF mRNA expression. Using chromatin
   immunoprecipitation analyses in pulmonary artery endothelial cells, we
   found that hypoxia-mediated formation of the base oxidation product
   8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) in VEGF HREs was temporally associated with
   binding of Hif-1 alpha and the BER enzymes 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1
   (Ogg1) and redox effector factor-1 (Ref-1)/apurinic/apyrimidinic
   endonuclease 1 (Ape1) and introduction of DNA strand breaks. Hif-1 alpha
   colocalized with HRE sequences harboring Ref-1/Ape1, but not Ogg1.
   Inhibition of BER by small interfering RNA-mediated reduction in Ogg1
   augmented hypoxia-induced 8-oxoG accumulation and attenuated Hif-1 alpha
   and Ref1/Ape1 binding to VEGF HRE sequences and blunted VEGF mRNA
   expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequence analysis of 8-oxoG
   distribution in hypoxic pulmonary artery endothelial cells showed that
   most of the oxidized base was localized to promoters with virtually no
   overlap between normoxic and hypoxic data sets. Transcription of genes
   whose promoters lost 8-oxoG during hypoxia was reduced, while those
   gaining 8-oxoG was elevated. Collectively, these findings suggest that
   the BER pathway links hypoxia-induced introduction of oxidative DNA
   modifications in promoters of hypoxia-inducible genes to transcriptional
   activation.}},

Abstract = {{A novel trifunctional catalyst with basic, acidic and metal sites was
   synthesized by nanocolloidal method and used in industrially important
   reactions, in the laboratory. The synthesized catalyst consisted of
   palladium and hydrotalcite supported on transition metal modified
   hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) and was characterized in virgin and
   reused states using a number of techniques such as elemental analysis,
   FTIR, NH3-TPD, CO2- TPD, H-2- TPR, XRD and BET surface area. The
   activity of particular catalytic site was engineered so that a desired
   reaction pathway was followed in spite of possibility of multiple series
   and parallel or complex reactions. One pot cascade engineered synthesis
   of ethyl benzyl acetoacetate from benzaldehyde and ethyl acetoacetate
   was studied in solvent free condition in a batch reactor. The effects of
   various parameters on the rates of reaction were analysed to establish
   instantaneous selectivity. Reaction mechanism and kinetic modelling was
   studied to validate the experimental results. The reaction follows
   Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson mechanism involving weak adsorption
   of reactants and products. The apparent activation energy was found to
   be 13 kcal/mol and intrinsic kinetic constant 33 cm(6) mol(-1)
   g(cat)(-1) s(-1). This study was further extended to synthesis of methyl
   isobutyl ketone (MIBK) from acetone in solvent free condition. Similar
   experimental and theoretical analysis was done for MIBK synthesis for
   which the activation energy and intrinsic kinetic constant were found to
   be 12 kcal/mol and 4 cm(6) mol(-1) g(cat)(-1) s(-1), respectively. (C)

Abstract = {{A 48-year-old man presented with recurrent spontaneous hemothoraces,
   which ultimately were found to be secondary to a pedunculated costal
   osteochondroma causing vascular injury. After initially undergoing
   endovascular coil embolization, he ultimately required segmental rib
   resection containing the offending lesion for definite treatment.
   Although a few cases of symptomatic costal osteochondromas have been
   reported in the literature, as far as we know, no previous reports have
   provided direct radiologic confirmation of active bleeding or the role
   of angiographic intervention. In this report, we highlight the
   importance of CT angiography in establishing a direct link between an
   osteochondroma and recurrent hemothorax. We also discuss the diagnostic
   imaging challenges associated with this condition and the use of a
   multidisciplinary treatment strategy involving both angiographic and
   operative management.}},

   The 400-600 degrees C temperature range with two varied residence time
   (1 and 2 h) was considered for bone char synthesis. The results indicate
   that the microstructure, pore diameter and the crystal size have greatly
   been influenced by the increasing temperature and residence time. The
   sample prepared at 400 degrees C-2 h, a mesoporous carbon has been
   prepared which can be considered as a novel low cost adsorbent. The bone

Abstract = {{Efficacy of Allium cepa test system for screening cytotoxicity and
   genotoxicity of treated effluents originated from four types of
   industrial activities (two textile industries, three rubber based
   industries, two common treatment plants of industrial zones, and two
   water treatment plants) was assessed. Physico-chemical parameters
   including the heavy metal/metalloid levels of the effluents varied
   depending on the industry profile, but most of the measured parameters
   in the effluents were within the specified tolerance limits of Sri
   Lankan environmental regulations for discharge of industrial effluents
   into inland surface waters. In the A. cepa test system, the undiluted
   effluents induced statistically significant root growth retardation,
   mitosis depression, and chromosomal aberrations in root meristematic
   cells in most cases in comparison to the dilution water and upstream
   water signifying effluent induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. Ethyl
   methane sulphonate (a mutagen, positive control) and all the effluents
   under 1:8 dilution significantly induced total chromosomal aberrations
   in root meristematic cells in comparison to the dilution water and
   upstream water indicating inadequacy of expected 1:8 dilutions in the
   receiving waters for curtailing genotoxic impacts. The results support
   the use of a practically feasible A. cepa test system for rapid
   screening of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of diverse industrial
   effluents discharging into inland surface waters.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{829-839}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sound insulation of light steel frame (LSF) and wood stud double walls
   is being studied for several decades. However, some specific cases that
   include the presence of horizontal stiffeners or the use of specific
   linings, such as cement boards for the outer lining, instead of
   materials like OSB-resin panels or vinyl siding, are rarely
   investigated. Thus ten different LSF walls, using sheatings made from
   OSB panels, cement boards, plasterboards, Smartside OSB-resin panels,
   PVC panels and polymer mortar covered XPS panels, and having additional
   horizontal stiffeners between the LSF studs, were mounted in a sound
   transmission measurement facility and measurements were carried out in
   accordance with the ISO 10140:2010 package. Sound insulation was
   characterized by means of the sound reduction index R, the weighted
   sound reduction index R-w, spectral adaptation terms C;C-tr and sound
   transmission class. The influence of resilient channels and foam tape,
   placed between panels and the metallic studs, was also evaluated.
   Weighted sound reduction indices R-w ranged from 43 dB to 47 dB, being
   the smallest for a wall that uses PVC cladding and the largest for the
   wall that uses cement board sheating. The addition of resilient channels
   and foam tape provides an increase of up to 5 dB in R-w and STC. The
   slight increase in sound insulation above the modified mass-air-mass
   resonance provided by the resilient channels, leveling off at max 10 dB,
   was predicted correctly by a simple and generic model for the modified
   mass-air-mass resonance from the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Although satellite DNAs are well-explored components of heterochromatin
   and centromeres, little is known about emergence, dispersal and possible
   impact of comparably structured tandem repeats (TRs) on the genome-wide
   scale. Our bioinformatics analysis of assembled Tribolium castaneum
   genome disclosed significant contribution of TRs in euchromatic
   chromosomal arms and clear predominance of satellite DNA-typical 170 bp
   monomers in arrays of >= 5 repeats. By applying different experimental
   approaches, we revealed that the nine most prominent TR families
   Cast1-Cast9 extracted from the assembly comprise similar to 4.3\% of the
   entire genome and reside almost exclusively in euchromatic regions.
   Among them, seven families that build similar to 3.9\% of the genome are
   based on similar to 170 and similar to 340 bp long monomers. Results of
   phylogenetic analyses of 2500 monomers originating from these families
   show high-sequence dynamics, evident by extensive exchanges between
   arrays on non-homologous chromosomes. In addition, our analysis shows
   that concerted evolution acts more efficiently on longer than on shorter
   arrays. Efficient genome-wide distribution of nine TR families implies
   the role of transposition only in expansion of the most dispersed
   family, and involvement of other mechanisms is anticipated. Despite
   similarities in sequence features, FISH experiments indicate high-level
   compartmentalization of centromeric and euchromatic tandem repeats.}},

Abstract = {{The debilitating disease kala-azar or visceral leishmaniasis is caused
   by the kinetoplastid protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. The
   parasite is transmitted by the hematophagous sand fly vector of the
   genus Phlebotomus in the old world and Lutzomyia in the new world. The
   predominant Phlebotomine species associated with the transmission of
   kala-azar are Phlebotomus papatasi and Phlebotomus argentipes.
   Understanding the molecular interaction of the sand fly and Leishmania,
   during the development of parasite within the sand fly gut is crucial to
   the understanding of the parasite life cycle. The complete genome
   sequences of sand flies (Phlebotomus and Lutzomyia) are currently not
   available and this hinders identification of proteins in the sand fly
   vector. The current study utilizes a three frame translated
   transcriptomic data of P. papatasi in the absence of genomic sequences
   to analyze the mass spectrometry data of P. papatasi cell line using a
   proteogenomic approach. Additionally, we have carried out the
   proteogenomic analysis of P. papatasi by comparative homology-based
   searches using related sequenced dipteran protein data. This study
   resulted in the identification of 1313 proteins from P. papatasi based
   on homology. Our study demonstrates the power of proteogenomic
   approaches in mapping the proteomes of unsequenced organisms. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Silurian-Devonian deposits of central western Argentina contain one of
   the most diverse Palaeozoic records of Nereites in Gondwana. Nereites
   cf. cambrensis, Nereites irregularis?, Nereites jacksoni, Nereites
   macleayii, Nereites missouriensis and Nereites pugnus are documented in
   a turbidite-like succession of the San Rafael Block (Rio Seco de los
   Castanos Formation). The succession, historically assumed as deep-sea
   deposits or interpreted as a deltaic system, also contains abundant
   microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS) such as wrinkle marks.
   Glossy surfaces indicate abundant biofilms, where the fossil record
   comprises N. macleayii, N. missouriensis, scarce arthropod trackways
   (Diplichnites?) and undermat-miner structures. Nereites, the pioneer
   colonizer, is in some cases cross-cut by Dictyodora, while undermat
   miners are the late bioturbators. The succession is dominated by gravity
   flow deposits, including storm related, turbidite-like deposits and
   abundant wrinkle marks. These suggest deposition on the shelf rather
   than the deep sea. This study shows that microbial mats were not
   restricted to marginal marine environments during the mid Palaeozoic,
   and documents one of the most diverse Palaeozoic records of Nereites in
   western Gondwana. It also contributes to the record of Nereites,
   Dictyodora, and Zoophycos found, for first time, in association with
   microbial mat structures in the late Silurian-earliest Devonian, the
   Nereites ichnofacies together with abundant wrinkle marks. (C) 2015

   Reliability and Relationship to Neurocognitive Impairment and Symptoms}},

Abstract = {{Background: Convergence insufficiency (CI) is a common binocular vision
   deficit after a sport-related concussion (SRC). CI may result in visual
   discomfort and vision-mediated functional difficulties such as slowed
   reading and compromised attention, leading to impaired academic, work,
   and sport performance.
   Purpose: To test the reliability of repeated near point of convergence
   (NPC) measurements in a sample of athletes after an SRC; compare the
   symptoms and cognitive impairment of athletes with normal NPC to those
   with CI after an SRC; and explore the relationship among age, sex,
   learning disability, migraine history, and CI.
   Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.
   Methods: A total of 78 athletes (mean age, 14.31 2.77 years) who were
   seen a mean 5.79 5.63 days after an SRC were administered 3 trials of an
   NPC assessment, along with neurocognitive (Immediate Post-Concussion
   Assessment and Cognitive Testing {[}ImPACT]) and symptom assessments.
   Patients were divided into normal NPC (NPC 5 cm; n = 45) and CI (NPC >5
   cm; n = 33) groups. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and
   repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) assessed the consistency
   of NPC across the 3 trials. The ANOVAs were employed to examine
   differences on neurocognitive composites and symptoms between the normal
   NPC and CI groups. Stepwise regressions (controlling for age and symptom
   scores on the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale {[}PCSS]) were conducted to
   evaluate the predictive utility of the NPC distance for neurocognitive
   impairment.
   Results: Groups did not differ on demographic or injury characteristics.
   NPC differed between trial 1 and trials 2 (P = .02) and 3 (P = .01) for
   the CI group but not the normal NPC group. Internal consistency was high
   across NPC measurements (ICC range, 0.95-0.98). Patients with CI
   performed worse on verbal memory (P = .02), visual motor speed (P =
   .02), and reaction time (P = .001, (2) = .13) and had greater total
   symptom scores (P = .02) after the injury. Results of hierarchical
   regression revealed that the NPC distance contributed significantly to
   the model for reaction time (P < .001).
   Conclusion: CI was common (similar to 42\%) in athletes evaluated within
   1 month after an SRC. Athletes with CI had worse neurocognitive
   impairment and higher symptom scores than did those with normal NPC.
   Clinicians should consider routinely screening for NPC as part of a
   comprehensive concussion evaluation to help inform treatment
   recommendations, academic accommodations, and referrals for vision
   therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Decision makers often need to simultaneously consider
   multiple criteria or outcomes when deciding whether to adopt new health
   interventions. Objectives: Using decision analysis within the context of
   cervical cancer screening in Norway, we aimed to aid decision makers in
   identifying a subset of relevant strategies that are simultaneously
   efficient, feasible, and optimal. Methods: We developed an age
   stratified probabilistic decision tree model following a cohort of women
   attending primary screening through one screening round. We enumerated
   detected precancers (i.e., cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2
   or more severe (CIN2+)), colposcopies performed, and monetary costs
   associated with 10 alternative triage algorithms for women with abnormal
   cytology results. As efficiency metrics, we calculated incremental
   cost-effectiveness, and harm-benefit, ratios, defined as the additional
   costs, or the additional number of colposcopies, per additional CIN2+
   detected. We estimated capacity requirements and uncertainty surrounding
   which strategy is optimal according to the decision rule, involving
   willingness to pay (monetary or resources consumed per added benefit).
   Results: For ages 25 to 33 years, we eliminated four strategies that did
   not fall on either efficiency frontier, while one strategy was efficient
   with respect to both efficiency metrics. Compared with current practice
   in Norway, two strategies detected more pre-cancers at lower monetary
   costs, but some required more colposcopies. Similar results were found
   for women aged 34 to 69 years. Conclusions: Improving the effectiveness
   and efficiency of cervical cancer screening may necessitate additional
   resources. Although efficient and feasible, both society and individuals
   must specify their willingness to accept the additional resources and
   perceived harms required to increase effectiveness before a strategy can
   be considered optimal.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a paradigm of fuzzy clustering is augmented by available
   domain knowledge expressed in the form of relational constraints built
   with the aid of a collection of fuzzy sets. These constraints are
   described as a collection of Cartesian products of fuzzy sets or their
   logic expressions are used to form an augmented data space and transform
   nonlinearly original data. Depending upon the nature of the constraints,
   discussed are two categories of resulting representations (clustering
   spaces), namely homogeneous spaces (in case when the transformations are
   fully expressed by means of the constraints) and heterogeneous spaces
   (when the resulting space is composed of some original variables present
   in the initially available data space and those being transformed and
   expressed by means of satisfaction levels of the constraints). The role
   of information granules of order-2 is revealed with regard to results of
   clustering produced in the transformed space. A generalization of the
   proposed approach is also discussed in case the clustered data are not
   numeric but are provided in the form of information granules; in this
   case a special attention is paid to a way in which a representation
   (description) of information granules is realized through relational
   constraints. We elaborate on the formation of the space (induced by
   constraints) and original data as well as discuss the detailed
   algorithmic developments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction : Mechanical bowel obstruction (MBO) remains one of the
   most common abdominal surgical emergencies. The aetiology of MBO depends
   on the population demographics and period of time in which a given
   population was studied. We are presenting the results of an analysis
   covering 145 years of observations based on patients operated in our
   department.
   Methods : The single centre retrospective analysis included 1825
   patients with MBO. They were divided into 4 groups depending on the
   years in which they were treated : group 1 (1868-1898), group 2
   (1956-1970), group 3 (1987-1999), group 4 (2000-2013). The analysis
   covered the sex distribution, the mean age of patients versus the life
   expectancy and changes in MBO aetiology in every period.
   Results : We noticed an increase in the mean age and the growing
   divergence between life expectancy. Additionally, an increasing
   percentage of women were observed. There were also significant changes
   in the aetiology. An increase in MBO caused by cancer was observed. The
   rate of strangulated hernias doubled in the second period of time, and
   then it gradually decreased. Intestinal volvulus was common in the first
   period and became one of the rarest causes of MBO in the subsequent
   periods. MBO due to adhesions remained at the same level. It became,
   however, the most common cause in the last period.
   Conclusions : Within nearly 150 years significant changes occurred in
   the demographics and aetiology of MBO. Currently, the most common cause
   is peritoneal adhesions after previous surgeries. Although our results
   represent a single centre experience, they may reflect changing patterns
   in MBO in the Polish population over time.}},

Abstract = {{In everyday human communication, we often express our communicative
   intentions by manually pointing out referents in the material world
   around us to an addressee, often in tight synchronization with
   referential speech. This study investigated whether and how the
   kinematic form of index finger pointing gestures is shaped by the
   gesturer's communicative intentions and how this is modulated by the
   presence of concurrently produced speech. Furthermore, we explored the
   neural mechanisms underpinning the planning of communicative pointing
   gestures and speech. Two experiments were carried out in which
   participants pointed at referents for an addressee while the
   informativeness of their gestures and speech was varied. Kinematic and
   electrophysiological data were recorded online. It was found that
   participants prolonged the duration of the stroke and poststroke hold
   phase of their gesture to be more communicative, in particular when the
   gesture was carrying the main informational burden in their multimodal
   utterance. Frontal and P300 effects in the ERPs suggested the importance
   of intentional and modality-independent attentional mechanisms during
   the planning phase of informative pointing gestures. These findings
   contribute to a better understanding of the complex interplay between
   action, attention, intention, and language in the production of pointing
   gestures, a communicative act core to human interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic factors involved in susceptibility to insect bite
   hypersensitivity (IBH) in Belgian Warmblood horses (BWP) were
   investigated. Data relating to 3409 horses were collected using a
   questionnaire, administered to owners during sport competitions, BWP
   breeding days, breeder visits and after phone calls. Horses were
   classified as IBH-affected or unaffected, based on two `disease
   classifiers': a lifetime record, based on owner information
   (life\_status) and another based on whether or not the horse was showing
   clinical signs at the time of questioning (clin\_status). IBH prevalence
   was 10\% based on life\_status, and 6.2\% based on clin\_status. The
   heritabilities estimated using threshold animal models varied from 0.65
   to 0.78 on the underlying scale (0.18-0.26 on the observed scale). These
   research findings indicate that susceptibility to IBH is a heritable
   trait in BWP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Impulse control disorders (ICDs) occur in a subset of patients with
   Parkinson's disease (PD) who are receiving dopamine replacement therapy.
   In this study, we aimed to investigate structural abnormalities within
   the mesocortical and limbic cortices and subcortical structures in PD
   patients with ICDs. We studied 18 PD patients with ICDs, 18 PD patients
   without ICDs and a group of 24 age and sex-matched healthy controls.
   Cortical thickness (CTh) and subcortical nuclei volume analyses were
   carried out using the automated surface-based analysis package
   FreeSurfer (version 5.3.0). We found significant differences in MRI
   measures between the three groups. There was volume loss in the nucleus
   accumbens of both PD patients with ICDs and without ICDs compared to the
   control group. In addition, PD patients with ICDs showed significant
   atrophy in caudate, hippocampus and amygdala compared to the group of
   healthy controls. PD patients with ICDs had significant increased
   cortical thickness in rostral anterior cingulate cortex and frontal pole
   compared to PD patients without ICDs. Cortical thickness in rostral
   anterior cingulate and frontal pole was increased in PD patients with
   ICDs compared to the control group, but the differences failed to reach
   corrected levels of statistical significance. PD patients with ICDs
   showed increased cortical thickness in medial prefrontal regions. We
   speculate that these findings reflect either a pre-existing neural trait
   vulnerability to impulsivity or the expression of a maladaptive synaptic
   plasticity under non-physiological dopaminergic stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Given the interdependent nature of relationships within
   the family system, the purpose of this study was to examine the
   potential role of child-parent psychotherapy (CPP) to extend its
   positive influence beyond the mother-child relationship within families
   challenged by maternal depression. Accordingly, we analyzed longitudinal
   associations between depressive symptoms and marital satisfaction over 3
   years in order to evaluate if the benefits of CPP to mother-child
   attachment security might generalize within the family and indirectly
   benefit marital relationships. Method: We tested our hypotheses in a
   randomized control trial of CPP (N = 159 families) to examine the
   intervention's efficacy in families with mothers with histories of
   depression since the target child's birth (M-age = 20.4 months, SD =
   2.5; 56\% boys). Results: Using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) with
   an actor-partner interdependence modeling (APIM) framework, the results
   supported our hypothesis as well as revealed significant associations
   between depressive symptoms and marital functioning. Specifically,
   shifts in mothers' depressive symptoms within specific waves of
   follow-up were associated with corresponding shifts in both their
   husbands' and their own relationship satisfaction in those same waves.
   After controlling for those effects, only mothers with a history of
   depression who received CPP demonstrated slight improvements in
   relationship satisfaction over the 3 years of the study, suggesting
   secondary benefits of CPP within the family system. Discussion: Results
   are discussed in terms of the importance of examining therapeutic
   processes within the larger family system. Concerning future research,
   we also suggest examining potential mechanisms through which CPP might
   influence marital satisfaction.}},

Abstract = {{The Nlrp gene family contains 20 members and plays a pivotal role in the
   innate immune and reproductive systems in the mouse. During evolution,
   seven Nlrp4 gene copies (named from Nlrp4a to Nlrp4g). Nlrp4a-Nlrp4g
   have arisen that display specific or preferential ovarian expression
   patterns. However, the expression pattern and localization of Nlrp4g in
   mouse preimplantation embryo development are unknown. Here we report
   that Nlrp4g was highly expressed in mature oocytes and zygotes, then
   downregulated and not detected after the 2-cell embryo stage. NLRP4G
   protein remained present through the blastocyst stage and was mainly
   localized in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, overexpression of Nlrp4g in
   zygotes did not affect normal development in terms of the rate of
   blastocyst formation. These results provide the first evidence that
   NLRP4G is a maternal factor that may play essential role during zygotic
   genome activation in the mouse.}},

Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{As a part of scheduling, Berth Allocation Problem can be considered as a
   problem of minimizing the total service time of vessels which berth at
   the port. The purpose is to optimize the efficiency of the port and the
   passing rate of vessels. The balanced deployment issues of yards can be
   transformed into considered as an equilibrium assignment of yard
   storage. The purpose is to give the loading vessels more choices to
   choose their best lanes and enhance the efficiency of the yard, as well
   as reduce the transportation costs. This paper combines berth allocation
   and yard assignment problems to build a collaborative berth allocation
   model with multiple ports under the background of bulk ports. The
   objective of this model consists of two parts: The minimization of total
   service time of vessels and the equilibrium assignment of yard storage.
   This paper uses two approaches to solve the above-mentioned mixed
   integer nonlinear programming problems: IBM ILOG CPLEX and Genetic
   Algorithm. According to the actual data of Majishan Port and Ore
   Transfer Terminal of Lake Shulang, many numerical experiments are
   conducted. This paper analyzes and compares these two approaches and
   proves the validity and accuracy of Genetic Algorithm and CPLEX. The
   model and the analysis procedure of numerical experiments are of certain
   reference value and practical significance on the management of berth
   allocation and yard assignment with multiple ports.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FUEL CELL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Chemical compatibility of sealing glass with metal interconnects is a
   critical issue for planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). In this paper,
   interface reactions between a sealing glass and a ferritic metal
   interconnect (SS410) are tested under three different heat treatment
   conditions: sealing (static), aging (static), and thermal cycling
   (dynamic). The results show that the BaCrO4 crystals with two different
   morphology (round-shaped and needle-shaped) form both at the three-phase
   boundary (where air, glass, and SS410 meet) and on the surface of the
   sealing glass under the three conditions. Round-shaped BaCrO4 crystals
   form with low O-2 concentration and short reaction time. Needle-shaped
   BaCrO4 crystals form with high O-2 concentration and long reaction time.
   For the thermal cycling condition, the BaCrO4 formed at early stages
   causes the delamination of the sealing interface. Then, O-2 diffuses
   into the interior interface along the delamination path, which results
   in the formation of BaCrO4 at the interior interface. The
   delaminationenhanced BaCrO4 formation during thermal cycling will lead
   to crack along the sealing interface, causing the striking increase of
   leak rates.}},

   that was confirmed by coronary angiography were enrolled in this study
   and completed the follow-up. The serum potassium level was evaluated
   within first 24 h after admission. The primary outcome in this study was
   all-cause mortality. Patients were categorized into five groups to
   determine the relation between admission serum potassium levels and
   long-term mortality: < 3.5, 3.5 to < 4.0, 4.0 to < 4.5, 4.5 to < 5.0,
   and > 5 mEq/L. There was a U-shaped relationship between admission serum
   potassium levels and long-term mortality that persisted after
   multivariable adjustment. The mortality risk was lowest in the group of
   patients with potassium levels of 3.5 to < 4.0 mEq/L, whereas mortality
   was higher in patients with potassium levels > 4.5 {[}hazard ratio (HR)

   and a parts per thousand yen5.0 mEq/L, respectively] or < 3.5 mEq/L (HR
   2.14, 95 \% CI 1.28 to 3.59). There was a U-shaped relationship between
   admission serum potassium levels and long-term mortality for ACS
   patients; in particular, among the examined patients, the lowest
   mortality was observed in those with admission serum potassium levels of
   between 3.5 and < 4.5 mEq/L compared with those who had higher or lower
   potassium levels.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) is considered the standard
   of care in the management of stage II/III rectal cancer. The aim of this
   retrospective study was to assess the efficacy and safety of
   preoperative CRT in our patient cohort with locally advanced rectal
   adenocarcinoma.
   Methods: Forty patients with cT3-4N0-2M0 adenocarcinoma of the lower (n
   = 26) and mid/upper (n = 14) rectum were enrolled in this study between
   2001 and 2012. Radiotherapy (RT) was given to the pelvis. The median
   prescribed dose was 45 Gy (daily dose, 1.8 - 2.0 Gy). All patients
   received chemotherapy concurrently with RT and underwent surgery 6 - 8
   weeks after CRT. Low anterior resection (LAR) was achieved in 21
   patients. Total mesorectal excision (TME) was performed in 24 patients.
   Results: Tumor downstaging (expressed as TN downstaging) was observed in
   15 patients (38\%); a pathological complete response (pCR) was
   pathologically confirmed in six of them. In nine out of the 26 (23\%)
   patients with low lying tumors, sphincter preservation (SP) was
   possible. SP was also possible in all but one patient (13\%) who
   achieved a pCR. In three out of 15 patients (8\%) with preoperative
   sphincter infiltration, SP was achieved. With a median follow-up of 58
   months, the 4-year local control (LC), distant metastases-free survival
   (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were
   89.7\%, 86.9\%, 79.5\% and 81.2\%, respectively. The pretreatment tumor
   size was predictive of response to preoperative CRT. The response to
   preoperative CRT did show a significant impact on DFS and on OS. TME
   resulted in a statistically significant increased DFS rate. No grade 3/4
   acute toxicity was reported. Three patients developed grade 3 late side
   effects.
   Conclusion: Preoperative CRT demonstrates encouraging rates of disease
   control and facilitates complete resection and SP in advanced rectal
   cancer with acceptable late toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of ouabain (OUA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vivo on
   hippocampal membranes (RHM) of Wistar male rats aged 3 months were
   analyzed. After intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of OUA only, LPS only,
   OUA plus LPS, or saline, the content of proteins, phospholipids,
   cholesterol and gangliosides from RHM was analyzed. The total protein
   and cholesterol contents of RHM were not significantly affected by OUA
   or LPS for the experimentally paired groups. In contrast, total
   phospholipids and gangliosides were strongly modulated by either OUA or
   LPS treatments. LPS reduced the total phospholipids (roughly 23 \%) and
   increased the total gangliosides (approximately 40 \%). OUA alone
   increased the total phospholipids (around 23 \%) and also the total
   gangliosides (nearly 34 \%). OUA pretreatment compensated the
   LPS-induced changes, preserving the total phospholipids and gangliosides
   around the same levels of the control. Thus, an acute treatment with OUA
   not only modulated the composition of hippocampal membranes from
   3-month-old rats, but also was apparently able to counteract membrane
   alterations resulting from LPS-induced neuroinflammation. This study
   demonstrates for the first time that the OUA capacity modulates the
   lipid composition of hippocampal plasma membranes from rats with
   LPS-induced neuroinflammation.}},

Abstract = {{After-treatment systems for diesel vehicles face a challenge for
   upcoming emission regulations. Regarding the level of nitrogen oxides
   (NOx) and soot required, the global catalytic activity of the exhaust
   line needs to be improved. Hydrothermal aging conditions explored during
   particulate filter regeneration are very stringent for the deNOx
   catalyst and can strongly reduce its durability. Ammonia selective
   catalytic reduction (NH3-SCR) systems mainly based on copper or iron
   exchanged zeolite catalysts have emerged as effective technologies to
   reduce NOx emissions with their durability being continuously improved.
   In this work, we evaluated the impact of different hydrothermal
   treatments on a commercial copper-exchanged zeolite catalyst. The goal
   was to link the catalytic material property changes with catalytic
   performance changes as a function of both aging duration and
   temperature. The evolution of the zeolite structure as well as the
   changes of the copper state were experimentally investigated. Based on a
   detailed material properties analysis of Cu-zeolite, a semi-detailed
   kinetic model of has been built to quantitatively predict adsorption and
   desorption of NH3 as a function of hydrothermal aging conditions. This
   work is a first step to bridge the gap between lab analysis conclusions
   and global reactivity observed in real conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel multimedia information system, called SAPTE,
   for supporting the discourse analysis and information retrieval of
   television programs from their corresponding video recordings. Unlike
   most common systems, SAPTE uses both content independent and dependent
   metadata, which are determined by the application of discourse analysis
   techniques as well as image and audio analysis methods. The proposed
   system was developed in partnership with the free-to-air Brazilian TV
   channel Rede Minas in an attempt to provide TV researchers with
   computational tools to assist their studies about this media universe.
   The system is based on the Matterhorn framework for managing video
   libraries, combining: (1) discourse analysis techniques for describing
   and indexing the videos, by considering aspects, such as, definitions of
   the subject of analysis, the nature of the speaker and the corpus of
   data resulting from the discourse; (2) a state of the art decoder
   software for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, called
   Julius; (3) image and frequency domain techniques to compute visual
   signatures for the video recordings, containing color, shape and texture
   information; and (4) hashing and k-d tree methods for data indexing. The
   capabilities of SAPTE were successfully validated, as demonstrated by
   our experimental results, indicating that SAPTE is a promising
   computational tool for TV researchers.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Dengue is an infection of great global importance with
   different clinical presentations. Objective: To establish the
   seroprevalence of infection by the dengue virus in a district of the
   Paraguayan Chaco. Material and Methods: Cross-sectional study in 418
   inhabitants of three villages in the district of Villa Hayes, Paraguay,
   using a probabilistic household sampling, a questionnaire and blood
   sampling. Antibodies were determined by the ELISA capture IgG anti
   dengue method and factors associated with seroprevalence were evaluated.
   Results: The overall seroprevalence for dengue virus infection was
   24,2\% (CI95\%: 20,2\%-28,6\%); 34\% (n: 142) of respondents reported
   history of dengue in the previous 10-year period. Of the 276 people
   (66\%) who reported no history of dengue infection, 37 (13\%) tested
   positive, which points out asymptomatic individuals. The main factors
   associated with infection were: males with significantly higher
   prevalence than women (31\%); to be over 60 years of age (44\%), be
   residents of Villa Hayes (31,1\%). No association with educational level
   or monthly income of the participants, nor housing condition, drinking
   water source or type of bathroom were observed. The larval infestation
   rate was 0,51\%. Conclusions: The relatively low seroprevalence of
   infection by the dengue virus is consistent with the small size of the
   district and highlights the potential risk of infection in future
   epidemics.}},

Abstract = {{Large group differences in political knowledge raise strong concerns
   about lasting inequities in U.S. politics. I argue such gaps emerge when
   factual questions operate unevenly across diverse populations, thereby
   inflating actual knowledge differences between groups. I illustrate this
   by revisiting the large knowledge deficit often observed among Latinos
   relative to Whites. Using a survey with traditional factual questions
   (e.g., what office is held by John Roberts?) and new Latino-themed items
   (e.g., what office is held by Marco Rubio?), I show that Whites are more
   likely than Latinos to correctly answer many conventional questions due
   to item features that are unrelated to people's level of knowledge
   (i.e., item bias). Latino-themed questions, however, do not display
   these extraneous characteristics. Consequently, Whites and Latinos have
   equal odds in correctly answering these latter items, provided they have
   the necessary knowledge level. I also show how such item quality
   differences matter in practical terms. Accordingly, I establish that
   using a scale of unbiased items reduces the Latino-White knowledge
   deficit from 31 to 8 \%, with the latter gap more fully explained by
   individual differences in established correlates of political knowledge.
   I then show that uneven item performance distorts inferences about
   knowledge's influence on mass opinion. I discuss the implications of
   these results for political knowledge's conceptualization and
   measurement in an increasingly diverse U.S. polity.}},

Abstract = {{Several regions have been transformed from passive locations to active

   this corridor has the characteristics of an innovative environment.
   Based on qualitative analysis, we performed a literature review,
   followed by several interviews with participants in the innovative
   activities within the study region. The results show that this
   industrial corridor was created because of its strategic geographic
   location in order to attract more investments in the region, but without
   a definitive plan. Therefore, a local regulation process was designed
   and implemented, yet is still in under revision. This regulation
   incorporates several strategies aimed at promoting innovation, which the
   government will support if various states in the region and adopt
   similar development patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Local strategies to reduce green-house gases (GHG) imply
   changes of non-climatic exposure patterns. Objective: To assess the
   health impacts of locally relevant transport-related climate change
   policies in Basel, Switzerland.
   Methods: We modelled change in mortality and morbidity for the year 2020
   based on several locally relevant transport scenarios including all
   decided transport policies up to 2020, additional realistic and
   hypothesized traffic reductions, as well as ambitious diffusion levels
   of electric cars. The scenarios were compared to the reference condition
   in 2010 assumed as status quo. The changes in non-climatic population
   exposure included ambient air pollution, physical activity, and noise.
   As secondary outcome, changes in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)
   were put into perspective with predicted changes of CO2 emissions and
   fuel consumption.
   Results: Under the scenario that assumed a strict particle emissions
   standard in diesel cars and all planned transport measures, 3\% of
   premature deaths could be prevented from projected PM2.5 exposure
   reduction. A traffic reduction scenario assuming more active trips
   provided only minor added health benefits for any of the changes in
   exposure considered. A hypothetical strong support to electric vehicles
   diffusion would have the largest health effectiveness given that the
   energy production in Basel comes from renewable sources.
   Conclusion: The planned local transport related GHG emission reduction
   policies in Basel are sensible for mitigating climate change and
   improving public health. In this context, the most effective policy
   remains increasing zeroemission vehicles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   The current study aggregated data from across all APA-accredited school
   psychology training programs to determine trends in internship types
   that students completed and programmatic requirements that might
   influence those trends. The study showed that 20\% of students are
   completing internships of unknown quality. Further, participation in the
   Match and subsequent success in matching to an APA-accredited or
   APPIC-member internship were more likely to occur for students from
   programs that required or encouraged students to participate in the
   Match, had a firm deadline for dissertation proposals (with earlier
   deadlines being more successful), and were flexible in their policies
   regarding when students could complete a (600-hour) school-based
   organized field experience. There was considerable variability within
   programs, suggesting that students from the same program may have
   different training experiences with unknown implications. These data
   provide a foundation for school psychology organizations and trainers
   from school psychology programs to discuss standards for determining

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy of casein
   phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) and casein
   phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate (CPP-ACFP)
   containing pastes among individuals with Sjogren's syndrome (SS).
   Thirty patients were randomised into three groups: CPP-ACP, CPP-ACFP,
   and 0.05 \% NaF to be used two times a day during a 28-day experimental
   period. Saliva was analysed for flow rate, pH, buffering capacity and
   mineral concentrations. Dental plaque was examined for pH. Following the
   formation of artificial carious lesion, participants wore enamel slabs
   for an in situ remineralisation study. Remineralisation potential was
   examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive
   spectroscopic (EDS) technique. SE microphotographs were subsequently
   analysed for area, diameter, perimeter, roundness and the number of
   enamel defects and percentage of tooth surface affected by defects.
   At the end of the experimental period, a slight increase of salivary pH
   could have been observed. No differences in mineral composition of
   saliva were noted. The use of CPP-ACP and CPP-ACFP contributed to a
   significant rise of plaque pH. Image analysis revealed excessive
   reduction of defects' dimensions in the three experimental groups, and a
   decrease of the number of enamel defects in the CPP-ACP and CPP-ACFP
   groups. The EDS analysis did not show differences in Ca/P, Ca/O and P/O
   ratios in any of the treatment groups.
   CPP-ACP and CPP-ACFP hold promise as remineralising agents for patients
   with SS.
   Pastes containing CPP-ACP/CPP-ACFP show enhanced remineralisation
   potential compared with NaF mouthrinse in patients with SS.}},

Abstract = {{Aims To understand modes of death and factors associated with the risk
   for cardiac and non-cardiac deaths in patients with cardiac
   resynchronization therapy with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
   (CRT-D) vs. implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy, which
   may help clarify the action and limitations of cardiac resynchronization
   therapy (CRT) in relieving myocardial dysfunction.
   Methods and results In Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation
   Trial-Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (MADIT-CRT), during 4 years of
   follow-up, 169 (9.3\%) of 1820 patients died of known causes, 108
   (63.9\%) deemed cardiac, and 61 (36.1\%) non-cardiac. In multivariate
   analysis, increased baseline creatinine was significantly associated
   with both cardiac and non-cardiac deaths {[}hazard ratio (HR) 2.97, P <
   0.001; HR 1.80, P = 0.035, respectively], as was diabetes (HR 1.79, P =
   0.006; HR 1.73, P = 0.038, respectively), and the worst New York Heart
   Association Class > II more than 3 months prior to enrolment (HR 1.90, P
   = 0.012; HR 2.46, P = 0.010, respectively). Baseline left atrial volume
   index was significantly associated only with cardiac mortality (HR 1.28
   per 5 unit increase, P < 0.001). Ischaemic cardiomyopathy was associated
   only with non-cardiac death (HR 3.54, P = 0.001). CRT-D vs. an ICD-only
   was associated with a reduced risk for cardiac death in patients with
   left bundle branch block (LBBB) (HR 0.56, P = 0.029) but was associated
   with an increased risk for non-cardiac death in non-LBBB patients (HR
   3.48, P = 0.048).
   Conclusions In MADIT-CRT, two-thirds of the deaths were cardiac and
   one-third non-cardiac. Many of the same risk factors were associated
   with both cardiac and non-cardiac mortalities. CRT-D was associated with
   a reduced risk for cardiac death in LBBB but an increased risk for
   non-cardiac death in non-LBBB.}},

Abstract = {{The relatively fresh and cold East Greenland Current (EGC) connects the
   Arctic with the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean. Its strength and
   influence on the freshwater balance in the North Atlantic affects both
   the Subpolar Gyre dynamics and deep convection in the Labrador Sea.
   Enhanced freshwater and sea-ice expansion in the subpolar North Atlantic
   is suggested to modify the northward heat transport within the North
   Atlantic Current. High-resolution palaeoceanographic reconstructions,
   based on planktic and benthic foraminifera assemblage data, from the
   central East Greenland shelf (Foster Bugt) reveal distinct centennial to
   millennial-scale oceanographic variability that relates to climatic
   changes during the mid to late Holocene (the last c. 6.3 ka BP). Our
   data highlight intervals of cooling and freshening of the polar surface
   EGC waters that accompany warming in the subsurface Atlantic waters,
   which are a combination of chilled Atlantic Intermediate Water (AIW)
   from the Arctic Ocean and of the Return Atlantic Current (RAC) from the
   West Spitsbergen Current (WSC). Mid Holocene thermal optimum conditions
   prevailed until c. 4.5 ka BP. A thin/absent surface Polar Water layer,
   low drift/sea-ice occurrence and strong contribution of recirculating
   warm Atlantic waters at the subsurface, suggest a relatively weak EGC
   during this period. Subsequently, between 1.4 and 4.5 ka BP, the water
   column became well stratified as the surface Polar Water layer thickened
   and cooled, indicating a strong EGC. This EGC strengthening parallelled
   enhanced subsurface chilled AIW contribution from the Arctic Ocean after
   C. 4.5 ka BP, which culminated from 1.4 to 2.3 ka BP. This coincides
   with warming identified in earlier work of the North Atlantic Current,
   the Irminger Current, and the West Greenland Current. We link the
   enhanced contribution of chilled Atlantic Water during this period to
   the time of the `Roman Warm Period'. The observed warming offshore East
   Greenland, centred at c. 1.8 ka BP, likely occurred in response to
   changes in the interactions of i) a weakened Subpolar Gyre; ii)
   increased northward heat advection in the North Atlantic Current, and
   iii) a predominant positive North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillation mode,
   prevailing during the time of the Roman Warm Period. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We consider a Brownian motion (BM) and its maximal value on a fixed time
   interval {[}0, t]. We study functionals of the maximum of the BM, of the
   form where V(x) can be any arbitrary function and develop various
   analytical tools to compute their statistical properties. These tools
   rely in particular on (i) a ``counting paths{''} method and (ii) a
   path-integral approach. In particular, we focus on the case where , with
   r a real parameter, which is relevant to study the density of
   near-extreme values of the BM (the so called density of states), , which
   is the local time of the BM spent at given distance r from the maximum.
   We also provide a thorough analysis of the family of functionals ,
   corresponding to , with real. As is varied, interpolates between
   different interesting observables. For instance, for , is a random
   variable of the ``area{''}, or ``Airy{''}, type while for it corresponds
   to the maximum time spent by a ballistic particle through a Brownian
   random potential. On the other hand, for , it corresponds to the cost of
   the optimal algorithm to find the maximum of a discrete random walk,
   proposed by Odlyzko. We revisit here, using tools of theoretical
   physics, the statistical properties of this algorithm which had been
   studied before using probabilistic methods. Finally, we extend our
   methods to constrained BM, including in particular the Brownian bridge,
   i.e., the Brownian motion starting and ending at the origin.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-defined, researcher-selected outcomes are routinely used as the
   clinical end-point in randomized controlled trials (RCTs); however,
   individualized approaches may be an effective way to assess outcome in
   mental health research. The present study describes the development and
   evaluation of the Individualized Outcome Measure (IOM), which is a
   patient-specific outcome measure to be used for RCTs of complex
   interventions. IOM was developed using a narrative review, expert
   consultation and piloting with mental health service users (n = 20). The
   final version of IOM comprises two components: Goal Attainment (GA) and
   Personalized Primary Outcome (PPO). For GA, patients identify one
   relevant goal at baseline and rate its attainment at follow-up. For PPO,
   patients choose an outcome domain related to their goal from a
   pre-defined list at baseline, and complete a standardized questionnaire
   assessing the chosen outcome domain at baseline and follow-up. A
   feasibility study indicated that IOM had adequate completion (89\%) and
   acceptability (96\%) rates in a clinical sample (n = 84). IOM was then
   evaluated in a RCT (ISRCTN02507940). GA and PPO components were
   associated with each other and with the trial primary outcome. The use
   of the PPO component of IOM as the primary outcome could be considered
   in future RCTs. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most severe lung
   inflammatory manifestation and has no effective therapy nowadays. Sepsis
   is one of the main illnesses among ARDS causes. The use of fluid
   resuscitation is an important treatment for sepsis, but positive fluid
   balance may induce pulmonary injury. As an alternative, fluid
   resuscitation with hypertonic saline ((HS) NaCl 7.5 \%) has been
   described as a promising therapeutical agent in sepsis-induced ARDS by
   the diminished amount of fluid necessary. Thus, we evaluated the effect
   of hypertonic saline in the treatment of LPS-induced ARDS. We found that
   hypertonic saline (NaCl 7.5 \%) treatment in rat model of LPS-induced
   ARDS avoided pulmonary function worsening and inhibited type I collagen
   deposition. In addition, hypertonic saline prevented pulmonary injury by
   decreasing metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) activity in tissue. Focal
   adhesion kinase (FAK) activation was reduced in HS group as well as
   neutrophil infiltration, NOS2 expression and NO content. Our study shows
   that fluid resuscitation with hypertonic saline decreases the
   progression of LPS-induced ARDS due to inhibition of pulmonary
   remodeling that is observed when regular saline is used.}},

Abstract = {{Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common complication associated with septic
   shock that directly influences the prognosis of sepsis patients.
   Currently, one of the main supportive treatment modalities for septic
   shock is fluid resuscitation. The use of hypertonic saline (HS: 7.5\%
   NaCl) for fluid resuscitation has been described as a promising therapy
   in experimental models of sepsis-induced ALI, but it has failed to
   produce similar results in clinical practice. Thus, we compared
   experimental timing versus clinical timing effectiveness (i.e., early
   vs. late fluid resuscitation) after the inflammatory scenario was
   established in a rat model of bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI.
   We found that late fluid resuscitation with hypertonic saline (NaCl
   7.5\%) did not reduce the mortality rates of animals compared with the
   mortality late associated with early treatment. Late fluid resuscitation
   with both hypertonic and normal saline increased pulmonary inflammation,
   decreased pulmonary function, and induced pulmonary injury by elevating
   metalloproteinase-2 and metalloproteinase-9 activity and collagen
   deposition in the animals, unlike early treatment. The animals with
   lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI that received late resuscitation with any
   kind of fluids demonstrated aggravated pulmonary injury and respiratory
   function. Moreover, we showed that the therapeutic window for a
   beneficial effect of fluid resuscitation with hypertonic saline is very
   narrow.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Observational registries on elderly patients with
   non-valvular atrial firbillation (NVAF) in treatment with the New Oral
   Anticoagulants (NAO) are still very few in the literature.
   Materials and methods. Prospective observational study on patients >=
   65years old with NVAF treated with NAO, referring to the Geriatric
   Clinic in Padua from September 2013 and January 2015. Demographic and
   clinical baseline data were collected at the time of inclusion, while
   side effects and suspensions were evaluated during the follow-up.
   Results. Of 191 enrolled patients, dabigatran was prescribed to 86
   (45\%), rivaroxaban to 72 (37.7\%), apixaban to 33 (17.3\%) patients.
   Mean age was 79.3 and males were more represented (57.1\%). Patients
   treated with low dose NAO were prevalent (71.7\%). Median CHA2DS2-VASc
   was 4 and median HAS-BLED was 3. The main reasons for switching to NAO
   were labile INR (38.2\%) and logistic INR monitoring problems (34\%).
   The most frequently used previous therapy were Vitamin K Antagonists
   (VKA) (54.7\%) and heparin (21.1\%). The most frequent side effects were
   minor bleedings (14.1\%) and gastroenteric intollerance (12\%). Twelve
   percent of patients suspended therapy during the follow-up.
   Discussion. From the preliminary results of a single center in the
   Veneto region, NAO have been prescribed to a population with high mean
   age, high ischemic risk and high bleeding risk. The patients' majority
   were previously in treatment with VKA and the most common reason for
   drug switch was labile INR. Of note, there was a high incidence of
   suspensions.}},

   the constitutional activities of international trading corporations to

   William A Pettigrew sets out the possibilities of corporate
   constitutionalism in the first essay which defines the concept, makes
   the case for viewing trading corporations as constitutional entities at
   home and abroad, signals some possible interpretive benefits for
   historians of empire, corporate historians, global historians, and
   constitutional historians, before offering an illustrative case study
   about the Royal African Company. Leading thinkers in international
   history (David Armitage), legal history (Paul Halliday), constitutional
   theory (VickiHsueh), and corporate history (Thomas Leng and Philip J
   Stern) offer their reflections on the possibilities of this new approach
   to the international activities of trading corporations. Although the
   Forum focuses on seventeenth century English trading corporations, it
   proposes to start a discussion about the utility of corporate
   constitutionalism for other European corporations and for periods both
   before and after the seventeenth century.}},

   Objectives: In this study, we aimed to examine the ameliorative effect
   N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to reduce the incidence of contrast nephropathy.
   Patients and Methods: This study was a prospective, randomized,
   double-blind clinical trial on 150 patients who underwent coronary
   angiography. The study was carried out on patients undergoing coronary
   angiography. Patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups of
   intervention group and control subjects. Intervention group took NAC 600
   mg orally twice a day. It was administered one day before angiography
   and continued until the second day after angiography. Control subjects
   received saline only. Serum creatinine was measured before and three
   days after coronary angiography.
   Results: There was no significant difference between intervention and
   control groups at baseline (P> 0.05). However, there was a significant
   decline in creatinine level among NAC patients (P= 0.001). Saline group
   had significantly higher proportion of nephropathy cases than NAC
   patients
   Conclusion: We found that the consumption of NAC is useful for contrast
   induced nephropathy (CIN) prevention.}},

Title = {{Impact of barley form on equine total tract fibre digestibility and
   colonic microbiota}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1943-1948}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed at assessing the impact of four barley forms on total
   tract apparent digestibility of dietary fibre in horses fed a large
   amount of starch in the morning meal (0.27\% BW). Processed barley forms
   had a greater pre-caecal starch digestibility than the whole form. Based
   on this result, we hypothesised that using barley-processing methods
   would limit the potential dumping of undegraded starch in the hindgut of
   horses and, consequently, the potential negative effect on fibre
   degradation in the hindgut. In a 4x4 latin square design, four mature
   geldings fitted with a right ventral colon-fistula were fed a meadow
   hay: concentrate (62 :38; dry matter (DM) basis) diet at 1.7\% BW. The
   concentrate was made of 80\% barley distributed either as whole grain or
   as processed forms: 2.5 mm ground, pelleted or steam-flaked. For each
   period, total tract apparent digestibilities of DM, NDF and ADF were
   determined over 3 consecutive days by total faecal collection, whereas
   pH, volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentrations and cultural functional
   bacteria counts (total anaerobic, cellulolytic bacteria, lactic acid
   producers, amylolytic bacteria and lactic acid utilisers) in colonic
   content were evaluated on 1 day 4 h after the morning meal. Total tract
   apparent digestibility of DM and dietary fibre was influenced (P<0.05)
   by barley form. Diets including thermo-mechanically treated barley forms
   led to a higher (P<0.05) total tract apparent digestibility of NDF than
   those constituted of ground barley and also led to a greater (P<0.05)
   total tract apparent digestibility of ADF than those made of whole or
   ground barley forms. However, no significant difference was observed in
   colonic pH, VFA concentrations and cultural bacteria concentrations.
   Owing to a high starch supply in the morning meal, the concentration of
   the functional bacteria in the colonic content averaged 7.8 log CFU/ml,
   5.9 NPM/ml, 6.9 and 7.3 CFU/ml for total anaerobic, cellulolytic,
   amylolytic and lactic acid-utilising bacteria, respectively.
   Consequently, providing horses with pelleted or steam-flaked instead of
   ground barley forms may limit the negative impact of starch on fibre
   digestibility in horses fed a high level of starch in the morning meal

Abstract = {{Objectives Persistence of antibodies against pathogens after
   antimicrobial treatment is a marker of therapy failure or evolution to a
   chronic infection. The kinetics of antibody production decrease
   following antigen elimination is highly variable, and predicting the
   duration of soluble immunity in infectious diseases is often impossible.
   This hampers the development and use of immunoassays for diagnostic and
   seroepidemiological purposes. In the case of Trichomonas vaginalis
   infection, the kinetics of antibody levels decrease following therapy
   has never been studied. We thus investigated the clearance of
   circulating anti-T. vaginalis IgGs after pharmacological treatment in
   patients affected by trichomoniasis.
   Methods 18 female patients affected by acute trichomoniasis were
   enrolled in this study. After metronidazole therapy administration,
   subjects were followed up monthly up to 5 months, and serum levels of
   anti-T. vaginalis IgGs were measured by ELISA.
   Results We showed that a successful therapy is characterised by a
   relatively fast decline of specific antibodies, until turning into
   negative by ELISA in 1-3 months. In a few patients we observed that the
   persistence of anti-T. vaginalis antibodies was associated with an
   evolution to chronic infection, which may be due to treatment failure or
   to reinfection by untreated sexual partners.
   Conclusions Our results describe the direct correlation between the
   decline of a specific humoral anti-T. vaginalis response and an
   effective antimicrobial therapy. These findings may facilitate the
   follow-up approach to circumvent limitations in developing new
   diagnostic tools and techniques routinely used in microbiology
   laboratories to assess the presence of T. vaginalis in clinical samples.}},

Abstract = {{To clarify the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in non-muscle invasive
   bladder cancer, HPV-DNA was scrutinized in formalin-fixed,
   paraffin-embedded (FFPE) bladder cancer tissue using single-step PCR
   (HPV L1) for HPV detection, followed by reverse line blot (RLB) for
   genotyping.
   A total of 186 patients who underwent transurethral resection of the
   bladder due to primary, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer from 2006 to
   2009 were reviewed. A positive control group of 22 cervical tissues with
   cervical carcinoma was included.
   Histology confirmed urothelial carcinoma in all patients: primary CIS,
   pTa, pT1 and pTa + pT1 in 14 (7.5 \%), 134 (72 \%), 36 (19.4 \%) and two
   (1.1 \%) patients, respectively. A total of 119 (63.9 \%) of them were
   classified as low-risk, while 67 (36.1 \%) were high-risk cancers. Tumor
   recurrence and progression (a parts per thousand yenpT2) were seen in 79
   and 11 patients (mean follow-up 45 months). The presence of HPV-DNA by
   single-step PCR was detected in four (2.2 \%) patients. HPV 16 and HPV 6
   were positive in two (1.1 \%) and one (0.6 \%) patient, respectively In
   one case, no HPV genotype listed on the RLB assay could be identified.
   In the control group, the HPV infection rate was 100 \%: HPV 16 in 12
   (54.6 \%) patients, HPV 16/18 in four (18.3 \%) patients, HPV 18 in two
   (9.1 \%) patients, HPV 16/45 in one patient (4.5 \%), HPV 18/33 in one
   (4.5 \%) patient, HPV 16/33 in one (4.5 \%) patient and HPV 33 in one
   (4.5 \%) patient.
   Our study demonstrates low prevalence of HPV infection in FFPE bladder
   cancer tissue, arguing against the etiological role of HPV in non-muscle
   urothelial carcinogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Race-associated disparities often occur in patients who undergo lower
   extremity total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Although it is imperative to
   elucidate and describe the disparities in race and ethnicity that may
   influence patient perception, satisfaction, and surgical outcomes, there
   is a paucity of reports detailing the nature of potential racial
   disparities in TJA. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to examine
   racial and ethnic disparities in the (1) physician-patient relationship;
   (2) use of TJA; (3) intraoperative and 30-day postoperative
   complications; and (4) patient-reported outcomes. Although there are
   limited studies that evaluated this topic, it has been shown that there
   are race-specific differences in physician-patient relationships.
   Specifically, African American patients report lower satisfaction rates
   in communication with their physician than their Caucasian counterparts
   and physicians were more apt to describe African Americans as less
   ``medically cooperative.{''} The majority of the studies the authors
   found regarding TJA use indicated that African Americans and Hispanics
   were less likely to undergo lower extremity TJA than Caucasians.
   Furthermore, racial minorities may have higher 30-day readmission and
   intra-and postoperative complication rates compared with Caucasians.
   Despite these compelling findings, concrete conclusions are difficult to
   make due to the presence of multiple confounding patient factors, and
   more studies examining the racial and ethnic disparities in patients
   with TJA are needed.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of human motor redundancy attracted much attention since the
   early studies of motor control, as it highlights the ability of the
   motor system to generate a great variety of movements to achieve any
   well-defined goal. The abundance of degrees of freedom in the human body
   may be a fundamental resource in the learning and remapping problems
   that are encountered in human-machine interfaces (HMIs) developments.
   The HMI can act at different levels decoding brain signals or body
   signals to control an external device. The transformation from neural
   signals to device commands is the core of research on brain-machine
   interfaces (BMIs). However, while BMIs bypass completely the final path
   of the motor system, body-machine interfaces (BoMIs) take advantage of
   motor skills that are still available to the user and have the potential
   to enhance these skills through their consistent use. BoMIs empower
   people with severe motor disabilities with the possibility to control
   external devices, and they concurrently offer the opportunity to focus
   on achieving rehabilitative goals. In this study we describe a
   theoretical paradigm for the use of a BoMI in rehabilitation. The
   proposed BoMI remaps the user's residual upper body mobility to the two
   coordinates of a cursor on a computer screen. This mapping is obtained
   by principal component analysis (PCA). We hypothesize that the BoMI can
   be specifically programmed to engage the users in functional exercises
   aimed at partial recovery of motor skills, while simultaneously
   controlling the cursor and carrying out functional tasks, e.g. playing
   games. Specifically, PCA allows us to select not only the subspace that
   is most comfortable for the user to act upon, but also the degrees of
   freedom and coordination patterns that the user has more difficulty
   engaging. In this article, we describe a family of map modifications
   that can be made to change the motor behavior of the user. Depending on
   the characteristics of the impairment of each high-level spinal cord
   injury (SCI) survivor, we can make modifications to restore a higher
   level of symmetric mobility (left versus right), or to increase the
   strength and range of motion of the upper body that was spared by the
   injury. Results showed that this approach restored symmetry between left
   and right side of the body, with an increase of mobility and strength of
   all the degrees of freedom in the participants involved in the control
   of the interface. This is a proof of concept that our BoMI may be used
   concurrently to control assistive devices and reach specific
   rehabilitative goals. Engaging the users in functional and entertaining
   tasks while practicing the interface and changing the map in the
   proposed ways is a novel approach to rehabilitation treatments
   facilitated by portable and low-cost technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Automatically identification of Equatorial Spread-F occurrence on

Abstract = {{F-region large-scale irregularities, also called plasma bubbles, are one
   of the most interesting equatorial ionospheric phenomena. These
   irregularities are generated in the equatorial region and afterwards
   extend to lower latitudes. They are one of the important topics of
   investigation in equatorial ionosphere electrodynamics and, therefore,
   are subject to intense theoretical and experimental research. The
   ionosonde is the most used scientific equipment to study the ionosphere
   and the F-region. With advancement of digital ionosonde, it is now
   possible to carry out an ionospheric sounding with a cadence of 5 min or
   even with 1-minute cadence. To analyse a large amount of ionograms, more
   sophisticated tools are needed. Thus, development of algorithms to
   identify and analyse different aspects of ionograms degrees has become
   very important to space science researchers. Multiple echoes recorded on
   ionograms are the signature of these irregularities in the ionograms,
   usually called Spread-E Spread-F is classified into three types: range,
   frequency, and mixed. Thus, automatic identification of Spread-F is
   important in ionospheric studies, because studies usually involve the
   analysis and interpretation of large numbers of ionograms. The main
   objective of this paper is to present a new computational tool, based on
   fuzzy relation, designed to automatically identify the occurrence of
   Spread-F in ionograms. The test was conducted in ionograms recorded in
   the Brazilian sector (Sao Jose dos Campos (23.2 degrees S, 45.9 degrees
   W, dip latitude 17.6 S-low latitude) and Palmas (10.2 degrees S, 48.2
   degrees W, dip latitude 5.5 degrees 5-near the magnetic equatorial)).
   The automatic identification of Spread-F occurrence was compared with
   those obtained manually and good agreement was found. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of gamma radiation on shelf-life of mackerel (Scomber
   scombrus) was studied. Changes in raw fish stored at 4 degrees C were
   investigated simultaneously, by performing sensory evaluation, chemical
   analysis (pH value and NH3 concentration), and biochemical analyses of
   histamine concentration and microbiological quality. Analyses showed
   that preservation by gamma irradiation prolonged the freshness and
   sustainability without any unintended sensory changes. Furthermore,
   increasing the dose during the 10 days of storage considerably reduced
   the concentration of histamine, but only slightly reduced the
   concentration of ammonia (NH3). Bacterial examinations showed that gamma
   radiation decreased the total number of bacteria. Our results indicated
   that the shelf-life of mackerel stored at 4 degrees C can be prolonged
   by irradiation with a dose of 3 kGy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An important goal in research and development (R + D) is to enhance
   powder injection moulding (PIM) to combine two or more materials with
   different properties in a single piece manufactured in one process
   cycle. A further advantage is the considerable reduction of mounting
   costs.
   In principle, a certain range of options should be suitable for creating
   multicomponent products. An important option is two-component PIM which
   is mainly characterized by a sophisticated sintering procedure taking
   into account the kinetics of all powder types involved. Investigations
   into how to fabricate immobile or mobile ceramic shaft-wheel components
   have been carried out successfully and even metal and ceramic materials
   can be connected for fixed joints.
   A further opportunity is opened up by In-mould Labelling PIM which uses
   powder filled tapes as the first component. Here again particular
   attention has to be paid to the sintering procedure, but if this is
   done, samples containing nano-sized powders in the surface area of the
   whole body can be obtained.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed GeneBase, a full parser of the National Center for
   Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene database, which generates a fully
   structured local database with an intuitive user-friendly graphic
   interface for personal computers. Features of all the annotated
   eukaryotic genes are accessible through three main software tables,
   including for each entry details such as the gene summary, the gene
   exon/intron structure and the specific Gene Ontology attributions. The
   structuring of the data, the creation of additional calculation fields
   and the integration with nucleotide sequences allow users to make many
   types of comparisons and calculations that are useful for data retrieval
   and analysis. We provide an original example analysis of the existing
   introns across all the available species, through which the classic
   biological problem of the `minimal intron' may find a solution using
   available data. Based on all currently available data, we can define the
   shortest known eukaryotic GT-AG intron length, setting the physical
   limit at the 30 base pair intron belonging to the human MST1L gene. This
   `model intron' will shed light on the minimal requirement elements of
   recognition used for conventional splicing functioning. Remarkably, this
   size is indeed consistent with the sum of the splicing consensus
   sequence lengths.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrazinamide (PZA) is active against major Mycobacterium tuberculosis
   species (M. tuberculosis, M. africanum, and M. microti) but not against
   M. bovis and M. avium. The latter two are mycobacterial species involved
   in human and cattle tuberculosis and in HIV coinfections, respectively.
   PZA is a first-line agent for the treatment of human tuberculosis and
   requires activation by a mycobacterial pyrazinamidase to form the active
   metabolite pyrazinoic acid (POA). As a result of this mechanism,
   resistance to PZA, as is often found in tuberculosis patients, is caused
   by point mutations in pyrazinamidase. In previous work, we have shown
   that POA esters and amides synthesized in our laboratory were stable in
   plasma (M. F. Simoes, E. Valente, M. J. Gomez, E. Anes, and L.
   Constantino, Eur J Pharm Sci 37:257-263, 2009,
   http://dx-doi.ez54.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1016/j.ejps.2009.02.012). Although the amides did
   not present significant activity, the esters were active against
   sensitive mycobacteria at concentrations 5- to 10-fold lower than those
   of PZA. Here, we report that these POA derivatives possess antibacterial
   efficacy in vitro and ex vivo against several species and strains of
   Mycobacterium with natural or acquired resistance to PZA, including M.
   bovis and M. avium. Our results indicate that the resistance probably
   was overcome by cleavage of the prodrugs into POA and a long-chain
   alcohol. Although it is not possible to rule out that the esters have
   intrinsic activity per se, we bring evidence here that long-chain fatty
   alcohols possess a significant antimycobacterial effect against
   PZA-resistant species and strains and are not mere inactive promoieties.
   These findings may lead to candidate dual drugs having enhanced activity
   against both PZA-susceptible and PZA-resistant isolates and being
   suitable for clinical development.}},

Title = {{In Vivo Evolution of CMY-2 to CMY-33 beta-Lactamase in Escherichia coli

   AmpC Conferring Resistance to Cefepime}},

Abstract = {{Cefepime is frequently prescribed to treat infections caused by
   AmpC-producing Gram-negative bacteria. CMY-2 is the most common
   plasmid-mediated AmpC (pAmpC) beta-lactamase. Unfortunately, CMY
   variants conferring enhanced cefepime resistance have been reported.
   Here, we describe the evolution of CMY-2 to an extended-spectrum AmpC
   (ESAC) in clonally identical Escherichia coli isolates obtained from a
   patient. The CMY-2-producing E. coli isolate (CMY-2-Ec) was isolated
   from a wound. Thirty days later, one CMY-33-producing E. coli isolate
   (CMY-33-Ec) was detected in a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample. Two
   weeks before the isolation of CMY-33-Ec, the patient received cefepime.
   CMY-33-Ec and CMY-2-Ec were identical by repetitive extragenic
   palindromic-PCR (rep-PCR), being of hyperepidemic sequence type 131
   (ST131) but showing different beta-lactam MICs (e.g., cefepime MIC, 16
   and <= 0.5 mu g/ml for CMY-33-Ec and CMY-2-Ec, respectively). Identical
   CMY-2-Ec isolates were also found in a rectal swab. CMY-33 differs from
   CMY-2 by a Leu293-Ala294 deletion. Expressed in E. coli strain DH10B,
   both CMYs conferred resistance to ceftazidime (>= 256 mu g/ml), but the
   cefepime MICs were higher for CMY-33 than CMY-2 (8 versus 0.25 mu g/ml,
   respectively). The k(cat)/K-m or inhibitor complex inactivation
   (k(inact))/K-i (app) (mu M-1 s(-1)) indicated that CMY-33 possesses an
   extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-like spectrum compared to that
   of CMY-2 (e.g., cefoxitin, 0.2 versus 0.4; ceftazidime, 0.2 versus not
   measurable; cefepime, 0.2 versus not measurable; and tazobactam, 0.0018
   versus 0.0009, respectively). Using molecular modeling, we show that a
   widened active site (similar to 4-angstrom shift) may play a significant
   role in enhancing cefepime hydrolysis. This is the first in vivo
   demonstration of a pAmpC that under cephalosporin treatment expands its
   substrate spectrum, resembling an ESBL. The prevalence of CMY-2-Ec
   isolates is rapidly increasing worldwide; therefore, awareness that
   cefepime treatment may select for resistant isolates is critical.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach for online signature verification
   that exploits the potential of local stability information in
   handwritten signatures. Different from previous models, this approach
   classifies a signature using a multidomain strategy. A signature is
   first split into different segments based on the stability model of a
   signer. Then, according to the stability model, for each segment, the
   most profitable domain of representation for verification purposes is
   detected. In the verification stage, the authenticity of each segment of
   the unknown signature is evaluated in the most profitable domain of
   representation. The authenticity of the unknown signature is then
   determined by combining local verification decisions. The study was
   carried out on the signatures in the SUSIG database, and the
   experimental results, thus, obtained confirm the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach, when compared with others in the literature.}},

Title = {{Normative misperceptions of tobacco use among university students in

Abstract = {{Introduction: Research conducted in North America suggests that students
   tend to overestimate tobacco use among their peers. This perceived norm
   may impact personal tobacco use. It remains unclear how these
   perceptions influence tobacco use among European students. The two aims
   were to investigate possible self-other discrepancies regarding personal
   use and attitudes towards use and to evaluate if perceptions of peer use
   and peer approval of use are associated with personal use and approval
   of tobacco use.
   Methods: The EU-funded `Social Norms Intervention for the prevention of
   Polydrug usE' study was conducted in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Slovak
   Republic, Spain, Turkey and United Kingdom. In total, 4482 students
   (7.1\% female) answered an online survey including questions on personal
   and perceived tobacco use and personal and perceived attitudes towards
   tobacco use.
   Results: Across all countries, the majority of students perceived
   tobacco use of their peers to be higher than their own use. The
   perception that the majority (>50\%) of peers used tobacco regularly in
   the past two months was significantly associated with higher odds for
   personal regular use (OR: 2.66, 95\% CI: 1.90-3.73). The perception that
   the majority of peers approve of tobacco use was significantly
   associated with higher odds for personal approval of tobacco use (OR:
   6.49, 95\% Cl: 4.54-928).
   Conclusions: Perceived norms are an important predictor of personal
   tobacco use and attitudes towards use. Interventions addressing
   perceived norms may be a viable method to change attitudes and tobacco
   use among European students, and may be a component of future tobacco
   control policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dictionary use is one of the potential vocabulary learning strategies in
   developing learning process and the types of learners' dictionaries have
   been diversified with the development of digital technology in recent
   years. The present study aims at investigating the effect of using
   mobile dictionary on the Iranian EFL learners' ability to recall and use
   the vocabulary. To ensure the homogeneity of the participants, an Oxford
   Placement Test was administered to 85 learners. Then 42 participants
   whose scores were between one above and below the standard deviation
   were selected as homogeneous and were randomly assigned to Mobile
   Dictionary (MD) as the experimental group and Paper Dictionary (PD) as
   the control groups. We administered a pretest to the groups before
   starting the treatment. During 15 sessions of treatment, 15 vocabulary
   categories were instructed to the both groups. The MD group received the
   words through a mobile dictionary to find the meaning and vocabulary use
   of newly taught words, while PD group followed the using a paper
   dictionary. The recall times of vocabularies were recorded at the end of
   each session to see the possible effect of mobile dictionary on the
   learners' ability to recall the vocabulary. Then both groups took a
   posttest administered immediately after the treatment. The results of
   the inferential statistics revealed that the learners in MD group
   outperformed those in PD group. Hence, it is suggested that using mobile
   dictionary can improve learners' ability to recall and use the

Abstract = {{Autoimmune metaplastic atrophic gastritis (AMAG) is a significant risk
   factor for pernicious anemia and gastric neoplasia. Still, the
   histologic features of AMAG are frequently overlooked, especially in the
   early stages of the disease. The purpose of our study, therefore, was to
   catalogue the progression of histologic changes that precede the
   development of AMAG in affected individuals. Over a 2-year period (2012
   to 2014), the diagnosis of AMAG was rendered on material from 113
   patients seen at Johns Hopkins Hospital (approximate to 1.8\% of in
   house gastric biopsies). Prior gastric body biopsies had been performed
   on 54 (48\%) patients in the cohort, and the majority of these specimens
   had also shown AMAG. Eighteen of the previous biopsies, however, carried
   a diagnosis other than AMAG: 13 inactive chronic gastritis, 2 acute
   Helicobacter pylori gastritis, and 1 each of eosinophilic gastritis,
   iron pill gastritis, and proton-pump inhibitor-like effect. Upon review
   of these 18 biopsies, the most common histologic findings were heavy
   full-thickness or deep lamina propria chronic inflammation (12),
   inflammatory destruction of oxyntic glands (12), metaplasia (intestinal,
   pyloric, or pancreatic acinar) (10), prominent lamina propria
   eosinophils (8), and parietal cell pseudohypertrophy (4). At least 2 of
   these features were present in the majority (13, 72\%) of the biopsies.
   In addition, 7 (58\%) of these patients were also found to have another
   autoimmune or inflammatory disorder before the diagnosis of AMAG.
   Although subtle, histologic features of developing AMAG are identifiable
   in routine gastric body biopsies. When metaplasia, full-thickness
   chronic inflammation, and/or oxyntic destruction are seen, a note
   suggesting laboratory testing and/or close clinical follow-up in this
   subset of patients may be warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To identify antenatal events associated with emergency
   caesarean sections in women presenting with antepartum bleeding and
   placenta praevia and to establish a score to predict the risk of
   emergency caesarean after a first bleeding episode has resolved.
   Study design: This retrospective multicentre study included 250 women
   presenting with antepartum bleeding and placenta praevia from 20 weeks
   of gestation until term in three maternity units. The score was
   constructed from data from 163 women after identification of antenatal
   risk factors associated with emergency caesareans for profuse bleeding
   due to placenta praevia. It was validated on a second independent cohort
   of 87 women.
   Results: Three variables were significantly associated with emergency
   caesareans: major or complete praevia, defined as complete or partial
   praevia (OR = 33.15 (95\% CI 4.3-257); p = 0.001), occurrence of 3 or
   more episodes of antepartum of uterine bleeding (OR = 2.53 (95\% CI
   1.1-5.86); p = 0.03), and a first (sentinel) bleeding episode before 29
   weeks of gestation (OR=2.64 (95\% CI 1.17-5.98); p = 0.02). A fourth
   variable, moderate or severe antepartum uterine bleeding, was
   significantly associated with emergency caesareans in the univariate but
   not the multivariate analysis (p = 0.006). These four variables were
   incorporated into a weighted scoring system that included major praevia
   (4 points), three or more episodes of antepartum bleeding (3), first
   bleeding episode before 29 weeks of gestation (3), and bleeding episode
   estimated as moderate or severe (1). A score >= 6/11 had a sensitivity
   of 83\% and a specificity of 65\% for predicting an emergency caesarean
   in the score development group and 95\% and 62\% in the validation
   group.
   Conclusion: A scoring system for placenta praevia with previous bleeding
   events, based on intensity, gestational age at sentinel bleed (before 29
   weeks), number of bleeding episodes (>= 3) and type of praevia (major)
   might be helpful to guide obstetric management and especially to
   determine the need for admission. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Digital image analysis (DIA) enables higher accuracy, reproducibility,
   and capacity to enumerate cell populations by immunohistochemistry;
   however, the most unique benefits may be obtained by evaluating the
   spatial distribution and intra-tissue variance of markers. The
   proliferative activity of breast cancer tissue, estimated by the Ki67
   labeling index (Ki67 LI), is a prognostic and predictive biomarker
   requiring robust measurement methodologies. We performed DIA on
   whole-slide images (WSI) of 302 surgically removed Ki67-stained breast
   cancer specimens; the tumour classifier algorithm was used to
   automatically detect tumour tissue but was not trained to distinguish
   between invasive and non-invasive carcinoma cells. The WSI DIA-generated
   data were subsampled by hexagonal tiling (HexT). Distribution and
   texture parameters were compared to conventional WSI DIA and pathology
   report data. Factor analysis of the data set, including total numbers of
   tumor cells, the Ki67 LI and Ki67 distribution, and texture indicators,
   extracted 4 factors, identified as entropy, proliferation, bimodality,
   and cellularity. The factor scores were further utilized in cluster
   analysis, outlining subcategories of heterogeneous tumors with
   predominant entropy, bimodality, or both at different levels of
   proliferative activity. The methodology also allowed the visualization
   of Ki67 LI heterogeneity in tumors and the automated detection and
   quantitative evaluation of Ki67 hotspots, based on the upper quintile of
   the HexT data, conceptualized as the ``Pareto hotspot{''}. We conclude
   that systematic subsampling of DIA-generated data into HexT enables
   comprehensive Ki67 LI analysis that reflects aspects of intra-tumor
   heterogeneity and may serve as a methodology to improve digital
   immunohistochemistry in general.}},

Abstract = {{An overview of current PCE compositions and synthesis methods is
   provided, followed by novel applications for PCEs including G-S-H-PCE
   nano-composites and a description of still unresolved challenges for PCE
   technology. In addition, the functionality of chemical admixtures in
   specific applications for low-carbon cements and concrete systems is
   discussed. The action mechanisms of retarders and the recycling system
   of sludge water by using retarder are introduced. Furthermore, the
   influence of fluoride ion and the effectiveness of PCE polymers in
   blended cements and the effect of non-adsorbed polymer are presented.
   And the impact of special interface modifying materials, of a refined
   pore structure and of chemical admixtures, particularly
   shrinkage-reducing agents, is described. The article concludes that more
   accurate quantitative micro-analytical methods and modeling tools will
   be needed to obtain a holistic understanding of factors affecting the
   microstructure of concrete, with the final goal of achieving a more

Abstract = {{Introduction: Currently, developing new antibacterial drugs as
   alternative antibiotics is a very active area of research, due to
   widspreading widespread prevalence of resistant strains of
   microorganisms. This work intends to investigate of antibacterial
   properties and influence on immune blood cells of the silver-based
   compound hexamethylenetetramine (methenamine) silver nitrate with
   general formula {[}Ag(CH2)(6) N-4]NO3.
   Materials and Methods: The antibacterial effect of the silver complex
   was investigated by agar diffusion and serial dilution methods. Silver
   complex have been investigated for its impact on the phagocytic activity
   of neutrophils and on immune cells during the reaction of blast
   transformation of lymphocytes (RBTL).
   Results: Studies have shown that hexamethylenetetramine silver nitrate
   possesses both bactericidal and bacteriostatic dose-dependent effect on
   tested bacterial strains, including Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus
   vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae. Escherichia
   coli were shown to be the most susceptible bacteria. Cytotoxic effect of
   silver salt on lymphocytes was detected in high dosage in RBTL. No
   significant immunosuppressive impact on neutrophils phagocytic activity
   of tested complex was shown.
   Conclusion: Agents of nosocomial infections were highly susceptible to
   the drug. Complex has proved to be promising as a prospective
   antibacterial drug with wide range of activity.}},

Abstract = {{The vibration reduction index of heavy junctions is predicted by means
   of a model based on spectral finite elements. This is equivalent to a
   finite element method but faster and with smaller computational costs.
   This advantage is used in order to perform a parametric analysis of the
   vibration reduction index for several junction types: T-shaped, L-shaped
   and +-shaped. The influence of several parameters such as: damping,
   junction dimensions or the mass ratio on the vibration reduction index
   is observed. The study is focussed to provide data and guidelines
   oriented to the EN-12354 design method for flanking transmission in

Abstract = {{Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) partially recovers both the instilled
   saline and the alveolar fluid, so-called epithelial lining fluid (ELF),
   but a correction for the dilution due to the BAL technique itself is
   needed to know the amount of recovered ELF. In this regard, urea
   nitrogen may be useful and has been proposed to calculate ELF. The aim
   of the present study was to develop and validate a new method to measure
   urea nitrogen in BAL fluid (BALF). We used 19 BALF samples obtained from
   neonates and infants with different respiratory conditions. The urea
   nitrogen assay was carried out on Cobas c311 analyzer (Roche
   Diagnostics). A validation study shows that the method is perfectly
   linear (R-2 = 0.999), sensitive (limit of detection = 0.055 mg/dL; limit
   of quantification = 0.16 mg/dL), repeatable (low = 0.15 +/- 0.02,
   13.3\%; high = 1.80 +/- 0.02, 1.1\%), reproducible (low = 0.14 +/- 0.02,
   14.2 \%; high = 1.76 +/- 0.04, 2.2 \%) with accuracy ranging between
   93-96\%. Our results support the robustness of validated procedure since
   the described method appears simple, precise, rapid, and suitable for
   routine analysis. Thus, it may be used to correct concentration of
   various noncellular BAL components and calculate their ELF amounts in
   neonates and infants.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of home orthostatic
   training (HOT) on autonomic reflexes in elderly patients with vasovagal
   syncope (VVS). Methods: Design and Setting: A single-blind randomised
   control trial was conducted at Eastbourne District General Hospital,
   East Sussex NHS Trust. Patients: Individuals with recurrent syncope
   underwent tilt-table testing between August 2007 and October 2009. Those
   with at least two syncopal episodes and tilt-test proven VVS were
   recruited. Participants were divided into those aged >65 years (O65) and
   those aged <65 years (U65). Interventions: Patients in the O65 group
   were randomised 1: 1 to receive active HOT (O65+) or sham HOT (O65-).
   The U65 group received active HOT. Participants performed HOT/sham HOT
   and recorded their training and symptoms. Patients had a repeat tilt
   test at 3 months. Outcome Measures: Time to syncope at repeat tilt-table
   testing, low-frequency heart rate variability (LF-HRV), high-frequency
   heart rate variability (HF-HRV), mean upslope baroreflex sensitivity
   (BRS) and mean downslope BRS were assessed. Results: A total of 106
   patients with recurrent syncope underwent tilt-table testing. Of these,
   45 consecutive patients (30 in the O65 group and 15 in the U65 group)
   were recruited. Two, one and three patients withdrew or were
   lost-to-follow-up in the O65+, O65-, and U65 groups, respectively.
   Symptomatic benefit occurred in four (31 \%) of the O65+, four (29 \%)
   of the O65-, and six (50 \%) of the U65. None of the autonomic measures
   changed significantly in any group. No difference was seen with HF-HRV,
   LF-HRV mean upslope BRS and mean downslope BRS. Fifty per-cent of the
   O65+ group stopped training because of back pain. Time constraint (25
   \%) was the most common reason for cessation in the U65 group.
   Conclusions: Despite good tilt training compliance, no improvement in
   autonomic measures in any group was shown. The most common reason for
   cessation of training was back pain in the elderly groups. This study
   does not support the use of HOT in elderly patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background Animal models suggest that the neurotransmitter inhibitor,
   botulinum toxin, when injected into the epicardial fat pads can suppress
   atrial fibrillation inducibility. The aim of this prospective randomized
   double-blind study was to compare the efficacy and safety of botulinum
   toxin injection into epicardial fat pads for preventing atrial
   tachyarrhythmias.
   Methods and Results Patients with history of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation and indication for coronary artery bypass graft surgery
   were randomized to botulinum toxin (Xeomin, Merz, Germany; 50 U/1 mL at
   each fat pad; n=30) or placebo (0.9\% normal saline, 1 mL at each fat
   pad; n=30) injection into epicardial fat pads during surgery. Patients
   were followed for 1 year to assess maintenance of sinus rhythm using an
   implantable loop recorder. All patients in both groups had successful
   epicardial fat pad injections without complications. The incidence of
   early postoperative atrial fibrillation within 30 days after coronary
   artery bypass graft was 2 of 30 patients (7\%) in the botulinum toxin
   group and 9 of 30 patients (30\%) in the placebo group (P=0.024).
   Between 30 days and up to the 12-month follow-up examination, 7 of the
   30 patients in the placebo group (27\%) and none of the 30 patients in
   the botulinum toxin group (0\%) had recurrent atrial fibrillation
   (P=0.002). There were no complications observed during the 1-year
   follow-up.
   Conclusions Botulinum toxin injection into epicardial fat pads during
   coronary artery bypass graft provided substantial atrial tachyarrhythmia
   suppression both early as well as during 1-year follow-up, without any
   serious adverse events.

Abstract = {{Reconfigurable ADCs bring a lot of functionality, high added value while
   sharing the development time and cost for each targeted application.
   Sigma Delta Modulators (SDMs) are very popular for their suitability for
   a wide range of applications. While individual SDMs can be tailored
   towards specific applications, a reconfigurable SDM addresses several of
   them at the same time. Due to their complexity (introduced by the
   programmability) and the limitations imposed by PVT variations,
   calibration is essential. To this effect, we introduce a new background
   calibration technique based on the limit cycle model of SDMs. We show
   how a simple counting and categorization of output bit-patterns can be
   used for measurement and correction/adjustment of the loop filter in the
   presence of multiple inaccuracies or changing operation conditions. The
   calibration scheme is demonstrated with measurement results from a test
   chip. The chip implements a third-order reconfigurable SDM for ultra-low
   bio-sensor current measurements. The reconfigurablity, coupled with the
   calibration scheme, allows a widely programmable bandwidth and dynamic
   range, making it useful for a variety of applications.}},

Abstract = {{Two star triblock terpolymers (PS-b-P2VP-b-PEO)(3) and one
   dendritic-like terpolymer {[}PS-b-P2VP-b-(PEO)(2)](3) of PS
   (polystyrene), P2VP (poly(2-vinylpyridine)), and PEO (poly(ethylene
   oxide)), never reported before, were synthesized by combining atom
   transfer radical and anionic polymerizations. The synthesis involves the
   transformation of the -Br groups of the previously reported
   Br-terminated 3-arm star diblock copolymers to one or two -OH groups,
   followed by anionic polymerization of ethylene oxide to afford the star
   or dendritic structure, respectively. The well-defined structure of the
   terpolymers was confirmed by static light scattering, size exclusion
   chromatography, and NMR spectroscopy. The self-assembly in solution and
   the morphology in bulk of the terpolymers, studied by dynamic light
   scattering and transmission electron microscopy, respectively, reveal
   new insights in the phase separation of these materials with complex
   macromolecular architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Urban source water protection requires knowledge of sources of fecal
   contamination upstream of drinking water intakes. Combined and sanitary
   sewer overflows (CSOs and SSOs) are primary sources of microbiological
   contamination and wastewater micropollutants (WWMPs) in urban water
   supplies. To quantify the impact of sewer overflows, predictive
   simulation models are required and have not been widely applied for
   microbial contaminants such as fecal indicator bacteria and pathogens in
   urban drainage networks. The objective of this study was to apply a
   simulation model to estimate the dynamics of three contaminants in sewer
   overflows - total suspended solids, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and
   carbamazepine, a WWMP. A mixed combined and pseudo-sanitary drainage
   network in Quebec, Canada was studied and modelled for a total of 7
   events for which water quality data were available. Model results were
   significantly correlated with field water quality data. The model
   confirmed that the contributions of E. coli from runoff and sewer
   deposits were minor and their dominant source was from sewage. In
   contrast, the main sources of total suspended solids were stormwater
   runoff and sewer resuspension. Given that it is not present in
   stormwater, carbamazepine was found to be a useful stable tracer of
   sewage contributions to total contaminant loads and also provided an
   indication of the fraction of total suspended solids originating from
   sewer deposits because of its similar response to increasing flowrates.

Abstract = {{Amphibian vertebrates are important models in regenerative biology
   because they present exceptional regenerative capabilities throughout
   life. However, it takes considerable effort to rear amphibians to
   juvenile and adult stages for regeneration studies, and the relatively
   large sizes that frogs and salamanders achieve during development make
   them difficult to use in chemical screens. Here, we introduce a new tail
   regeneration model using late stage Mexican axolotl embryos. We show
   that axolotl embryos completely regenerate amputated tails in 7 days
   before they exhaust their yolk supply and begin to feed. Further, we
   show that axolotl embryos can be efficiently reared in microtiter plates
   to achieve moderate throughput screening of soluble chemicals to
   investigate toxicity and identify molecules that alter regenerative
   outcome. As proof of principle, we identified integration 1 / wingless
   (Wnt), transforming growth factor beta (Tgf-beta), and fibroblast growth
   factor (Fgf) pathway antagonists that completely block tail regeneration
   and additional chemicals that significantly affected tail outgrowth.
   Furthermore, we used microarray analysis to show that inhibition of Wnt
   signaling broadly affects transcription of genes associated with Wnt,
   Fgf, Tgf-beta, epidermal growth factor (Egf), Notch, nerve growth factor
   (Ngf), homeotic gene (Hox), rat sarcoma/mitogen-activated protein kinase
   (Ras/Mapk), myelocytomatosis viral oncogene (Myc), tumor protein 53
   (p53), and retinoic acid (RA) pathways. Punctuated changes in the
   expression of genes known to regulate vertebrate development were
   observed; this suggests the tail regeneration transcriptional program is
   hierarchically structured and temporally ordered. Our study establishes
   the axolotl as a chemical screening model to investigate signaling
   pathways associated with tissue regeneration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The DDoS attack is more vulnerable attack in the self structured and
   infra structure less MANET environment. The bot net based flooding
   attack is very cheap and easy to implement. Many detection and
   prevention mechanisms has been proposed to avoid DDoS attack. Here we
   have proposed the stochastic model of covariance matrix analysis in
   which the entropy difference has been computed by the frequency
   distribution of rule metrics against the threshold entropy periodically
   which in turn difference is highest can be controlled by reCAPTCHA
   controller to defend against DDoS attack. The prevention mechanism by
   trust evaluation using clustering methodology used to identify the
   attacker and reduce the cost of detection mechanism. The Aumann
   agreement theorem based trust re-evaluation is also proposed in order to
   reduce the false positive and negative probabilities, such that the
   accuracy of the system is enhanced. Finally the nodes identified as
   attacker by their trust values will be evicted and rekeying has been
   done. The experimental analysis in NS2 with CAIDA dataset shows true
   positive rate and detection rate is high in the proposed mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to gain in-depth insight and
   enhance understanding of service users' experiences of the inutero
   transfer (IUT) process, in order to inform policy and improve the
   current service provision of maternal care.
   DesignQualitative descriptive study using semi-structured interviews.
   SettingParticipant's home or hospital in the Midlands, UK.
   PopulationFifteen women transferred in utero to a tertiary level
   maternity hospital; five male partners and two grandmothers.
   MethodsAudio-recorded individual or paired semi-structured interviews
   transcribed verbatum and analysed thematically using nvivo 9.
   Main outcome measuresFacilitators and barriers of the IUT experience.
   ResultsFindings suggest that IUT is an emotional experience that
   financially disadvantages patients and their families. Male partners
   were perceived to be most negatively affected by the experience. The
   quality of the IUT experience was influenced by a range of factors,
   including the lack of proximity to home and the lack of information.
   Patients had little knowledge or awareness of IUT, and most felt
   unprepared for displacement. Despite this, there was resigned acceptance
   that IUT was a necessary rather than adverse experience.
   ConclusionsThe experience of IUT for service users could be enhanced by
   ensuring that they are better informed about the process and the
   circumstances that necessitate displacement, that they are better
   informed about the hospital to which they are being transferred, and
   that they are transferred as close to home as possible. Efforts to
   minimise the emotional and socio-economic impact of IUT on women and
   their families also need to be considered.}},

   (Illumina MiSeq) was performed on baseline and virologic failure samples
   for all subjects analyzed for resistance by population sequencing during

   subjects with virologic response (n = 118). Primary NRTI or NNRTI drug
   resistance mutations present at low frequency (2\% to 20\%) were
   detected in 6.6\% of baseline samples by deep sequencing, all of which
   occurred in control subjects. Deep sequencing results were generally
   consistent with population sequencing but detected additional primary
   NNRTI and NRTI resistance mutations at virologic failure in seven
   samples. HIV-1 drug resistance mutations emerging while on RPV/FTC/TDF
   or EFV/FTC/TDF treatment were not present at low frequency at baseline

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the unsaturated zone and epikarst of karst
   aquifers in order to identify the hydrogeological behavior of these
   important but poorly understood parts of karst systems. A
   high-resolution monitoring of stalactite drips and artificial tracer
   test experiment in the vadose zone allows to draw a conceptual model for
   the local recharge processes through the unsaturated zone of karst
   aquifers. Those aquifers represent major groundwater resources in
   Belgium. Seven years of high-resolution stalactite dripping were
   recorded on 3 sites of the Han-sur-Lesse cave system (South of Belgium).
   The three sites show very different discharge variations but a similar
   behavior from one year to another. Analysis and comparison of the
   dripping cycles over 7 years highlight the vadose zone behavior and its
   relationship with surface infiltration (water excess). For each site, a
   water excess threshold at the beginning of the winter has been
   identified. This threshold is needed to refill the vadose zone/epikarst
   capacity before the dripping. The value of the threshold is relatively
   constant for each site during the 7 years, indicating the regularity of
   the capacitive system of the vadose zone. Unknown features have also
   been observed with discharge decrease during high water excess periods,
   linked to the drainage processes of epikarst. Finally, artificial tracer
   test reveals the duality of the unsaturated zone behavior, with fast
   transmissive pathways (velocity of > 6 m/h) related to a highly
   capacitive system (> 150 days of tracer restitution).}},

Title = {{Dark Matter annihilations in halos and high-redshift sources of
   reionization of the universe}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that annihilations in the homogeneous fluid of dark
   matter (DM) can leave imprints in the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
   anisotropy power spectrum. However, the relevance of DM annihilations in
   halos for cosmological observables is still subject to debate, with
   previous works reaching different conclusions on this point. Also, all
   previous studies used a single type of parameterization for the
   astrophysical reionization, and included no astrophysical source for the
   heating of the intergalactic medium. In this work, we revisit these
   problems. When standard approaches are adopted, we find that the
   ionization fraction does exhibit a very particular (and potentially
   constraining) pattern, but the currently measurable Trek) is left almost
   unchanged: in agreement with most of the previous literature, for
   plausible halo models we find that the modification of the signal with
   respect to the one coming from annihilations in the smooth background is
   tiny, below cosmic variance within currently allowed parameter space.
   However, if different and probably more realistic treatments of the
   astrophysical sources of reionization and heating are adopted, a more
   pronounced effect of the DM annihilation in halos is possible. We thus
   conclude that within currently adopted baseline models the impact of the
   virialised DM structures cannot be uncovered by CMB power spectra
   measurements, but a larger impact is possible if peculiar models are
   invoked for the redshift evolution of the DM annihilation signal or
   different assumptions are made for the astrophysical contributions. A
   better understanding (both theoretical and observational) of the
   reionization and temperature history of the universe, notably via the 21
   cm signal, seems the most promising way for using halo formation as a
   tool in DM searches, improving over the sensitivity of current
   cosmological probes.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-Poststroke fatigue is common and reduces quality
   of life. Current evidence for intervention is limited, and this is the
   first placebo-controlled trial to investigate treatment of poststroke
   fatigue with the wakefulness promoting drug modafinil.
   Methods-The trial was randomized, double-blinded, and
   placebo-controlled. Patients were treated with 400-mg modafinil or
   placebo for 90 days. Assessments were done at inclusion, 30, 90, and 180
   days. The primary end point was fatigue at 90 days measured by the
   Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 general fatigue domain. Secondary
   end points included the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Montreal Cognitive
   Assessment, the modified Rankin Scale and the Stroke-specific quality of
   Life questionnaire. Adult patients with a recent stroke achieving a
   score of >= 12 on the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 general
   fatigue domain were consecutively included. Exclusion criteria were
   severe cognitive disabilities and contraindications for modafinil
   treatment.
   Results-One thousand one hundred twenty-one patients with stroke were
   screened and 41 patients included, 21 received modafinil. The primary
   end point, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 general fatigue
   score, did not differ between groups. Patients in the modafinil group
   obtained better scores on the Fatigue Severity Scale (P=0.02) and in
   some subscales of the stroke-specific quality of life questionnaire
   (0.001<P<0.05), which were secondary outcomes. No serious adverse
   reactions were observed and there was no difference in blood pressure
   between groups.
   Conclusions-There were no significant differences between the 2 groups
   with regard to the primary end point. There were secondary significant
   outcomes that should be explored in future trials.}},

Abstract = {{Background In France, community pharmacists do not have free access to
   patients' lab results, and it is therefore impossible for them to
   identify patients with renal impairment. Objective (1) to evaluate the
   ability of community pharmacists (CPs) to identify drug related problems
   (DRP) in patients at risk for or suffering from renal impairment; (2) to
   evaluate the proportions of recommendations by CPs that lead to a
   modification by GP. Setting A prospective and observational study
   involving 24 community pharmacists in France. Methods Following special
   training, community pharmacists were asked to select 52 patients with
   the following characteristics: a parts per thousand yen65 years of age;
   prescribed at least two diabetic and/or antihypertensive drugs. Serum
   creatinine value was obtained for each patient and glomerular filtration
   rate estimated (eGFR) with the aMDRD formula. Those with a eGFR 60
   ml/min/1.73 mA(2) were considered having chronic kidney disease (CKD).
   Data was collected concerning whether the community pharmacists
   identified drug related problems and tried to inform the GP who
   prescribed the medications. Identified DRP were reviewed by a team of
   nephrologists and hospital clinical pharmacists. Primary outcome The
   proportion of CKD patients and those without serum creatinine
   monitoring, the number of drug related problems identified by community
   pharmacists, and the proportion of drug related problems resolved by the
   community pharmacists intervention to the GP. Results Of the total 791
   patients identified, 180 (22.8 \%) exhibited CKD, and 57 (7.2 \%) had
   not undergone serum creatinine monitoring. Among the 1297 drugs
   prescribed, 260 had to be adapted to eGFR. The proportion of DRP was
   21.5 \% (56/260), of which 40 \% (20) were identified by community
   pharmacists. Once the GP was informed, 33.3 \% (6/18) of DRP were
   resolved. Conclusion Community pharmacists identified 40 \% of DRP
   related to CKD prescriptions, leading to prescription modification by
   GPs in a third of the cases. These interventions are likely to decrease
   drug-related morbidity and mortality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to report the assessment of trends in deaths and
   disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributed to ambient particulate
   matter (PM) pollution from 1990 to 2010 by sex and age in Iran. We used
   the data of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 Study, and then we
   extracted its data on Iran for the years 1990, 2005, and 2010. The
   proportion of deaths and the DALYs caused by specific risk factors were
   assessed by using the comparative risk assessment and calculating the
   attributed burden of exposure level to each risk factor compared with
   the theoretical minimum level of risk exposure. Uncertainties in
   distribution of exposure, relative risks, and relevant outcomes
   calculation were disseminated into the estimates of the attributable
   deaths and DALYs. We found that the age-standardized death rate
   attributed to ambient PM pollution decreased to 27.90 cases per 100,000
   populations from 1990 to 2010 {[}86, 95 \% uncertainty interval (UI)
   76-97 to 62; 95 \% UI 54-71 per 100,000 populations, respectively]. This
   was mainly because of greater decrease in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)
   than in the other diseases attributed to PM pollution. Despite a
   decrease in the total DALYs and mortality rate attributed to PM
   pollution, the death percent increased by 6.94 \%, 95 \% UI 6.06-7.90 \%
   from 1990 to 2010. The number of the DALYs and death in age groups of
   more than 70 years increased in 2010 compared to that in 1990. The
   median percent change of the DALYs and death for all age groups shows
   that the DALYs and death increased by 6 \% (95 \% UI 8-19 \%) and 45 \%
   (95 \% UI 30-60 \%), respectively, in 2010 in comparison to that in
   1990. The increase in the DALYs and mortality attributable to PM
   pollution emphasizes the necessity of the effective interventions for
   improving air quality, as well as for increasing the public awareness to
   reduce the exposure of vulnerable age groups to PM pollution.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This paper describes a pioneering effort to introduce
   smoking cessation into Indonesia's medical school curriculum, and the
   first ever attempt to fully integrate tobacco control in all four years
   of medical school anywhere in Southeast Asia. The development,
   pretesting, and piloting of an innovative modular tobacco curriculum are
   discussed as well as the challenges that face implementation. Methods:
   In-depth interviews were conducted with medical school administrators
   and faculty in four medical colleges to determine interest in and
   willingness to fully integrate tobacco cessation into the college
   curriculum. A tobacco focused curriculum review, student focus groups,
   and a survey of medical students (n = 579) assessed current exposure to
   information about tobacco and interest in learning cessation skills. A
   modular tobacco curriculum was developed and was pretested, modified,
   piloted, and evaluated. Qualitative research was conducted to identify
   potential challenges to future curriculum implementation. Results:
   Fifteen modules were successfully developed focusing on the relationship
   between tobacco and specific organ systems, diseases related to smoking,
   the impact of tobacco on medication effectiveness, and information on
   how to explain to patients about effects of tobacco on their health
   condition. Lecturers and students positively evaluated the curriculum as
   increasing their competency to support cessation during illness as a
   teachable moment. Systemic challenges to implementing the curriculum
   were identified including shifts in pedagogy, decentralized curriculum
   decision-making, and frequent lecturer turnover. Discussion: A fully
   integrated tobacco curriculum for medical schools was piloted and is now
   freely available online. An important lesson learned in Indonesia was
   that a tobacco curriculum must be flexible enough to be adjusted when
   shifts in medical education take place. The curriculum is a resource for
   medical and expert committees in Southeast Asia deliberating how best to
   address lifestyle factors undermining population health.}},

   a lasing medium in which DNA not only acts as a host matrix but also
   functions as a fluorescence enhancer. A dramatic increase in the
   fluorescence led us to the observation of optical amplification in dye
   doped DNA thin films. We also indicate the possible tunability of the
   output emission in the green-yellow region. With the obtained results,
   we have enough reasons to lead to the development of DNA-based

Abstract = {{The number of sheep flocks in Brazil is increasing. It is known that
   lambs must be slaughtered when young for producing quality meat. The
   current study evaluated the inclusion of protected methionine, protected
   lysine, lysophospholipid and amylolytic enzymes in a diet to lambs and
   their effects on weight gain and quantitative carcass traits at
   slaughtering. Eighty non-castrated male crossbred Dorper x Santa Ines
   lambs, 20.57 +/- 4.33 kg live weight, were used. The feedlot lasted 64
   days and 60 animals were slaughtered. There were no differences for live
   weight, daily feed intake, feed conversion and average daily weight gain
   at the first 28 days of feedlot. From the 28th day lysophospholipid
   treatment presented the highest live weight. Lysophospholipid and
   amylolytic enzyme presented the best performance in average daily gain,
   followed by protected methionine, control and protected lysine.
   Lysophospholipid treatment presented higher daily feed intake rates than
   protected lysine and protected methionine. Feed conversion was lower for
   amylolytic enzyme and higher for control. No changing in carcass traits
   was reported due to additives. Better performance may be achieved with
   feedlot lambs fed on diets with the addition of amylolytic enzyme and
   lysophospholipid at the finishing phase.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis is carried out to study the heat transfer in a thin film
   fluid flow over an unsteady stretching surface. The base-fluid is
   assumed to be a two-component non-homogeneous equilibrium model with
   Brownian diffusion and thermophoresis. The fluid is non-Newtonian with
   shear thinning or shear thickening property. In addition, the fluid
   properties, namely the thermal conductivity and the mass diffusivity
   vary linearly with temperature and species concentration respectively.
   Using a similarity transformation, the governing partial differential
   equations are converted into a system of non-linear ordinary
   differential equations with variable coefficients. Solutions of these
   equations are obtained numerically by an implicit difference scheme. The
   effects of the physical parameters on the velocity, temperature and
   concentration fields are analyzed graphically. The results for the film
   thickness, the skin friction, the Nusselt number and the Sherwood number
   are presented through tables. It is observed that the nanoparticles
   increase the energy exchange rate; but the Brownian motion reduces the
   nanoparticle diffusion. However, as the Brownian motion parameter
   increases, the mass transfer rate increases: Quite opposite is true with
   the heat transfer rate. The results obtained reveal many interesting
   behaviors that warrant further study on the thin film power law
   base-fluid flow phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{The laser action from a conductive oligomer 9,9,9',9',9 `',9
   `'-hexakis(octyI)-2,7',2',7 `'-trifluorene (HOTF) has been demonstrated
   in this study. First absorption spectra were studied for HOTF in benzene
   under a wide range of concentrations. The spectra showed that there was
   only one peak at 355 nm under a wide range of concentrations indicating
   the absence of dimerization. The fluorescence spectra for low
   concentrations showed two peaks, at 390 nm and 410 nm, which could be
   attributed to the monomer and the excimer. At higher concentrations, the
   peak at 390 nm almost vanished and the dominant peak was at 410 nm with
   a hump at 435 nm. Laser action was tested in a transverse pumping
   configuration where the conducting oligomer was pumped by laser pulses
   from the third harmonic of an Nd:YAG laser (355 nm). It could be seen
   that there were two amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) peaks, at 390
   and 410 nm. These peaks could be attributed to the monomer and excimer
   of the HOTF oligomer; but, even after our best efforts, we were not able
   observe the ASE peak at 435 nm corresponding to the hump in the
   fluorescence spectra. The power of ASE and the photo-chemical stability
   were remarkably high. This trend for the oligomer is entirely different
   from its conjugated polymer counterpart
   poly(9,9-dioctyl-fluorenyl-2,7-diyl) (PFO). This is perhaps the first
   report on ASE from an excimeric state of the conjugated oligomer HOTF in
   liquid solution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Seemingly every theory of population ethics is confronted with
   unpalatable implications. While various approaches to the subject have
   been taken, including non-consequentialist approaches, this area has
   been dominated by utilitarian thought. The two main approaches to
   population ethics have been total utilitarianism (TU') and average
   utilitarianism (AU'). According to TU, we should seek to bring about the
   state of affairs that maximizes the total amount of happiness. According
   to AU, we should seek to bring about the state of affairs that maximizes
   average per capita happiness. Both theories have been afflicted by
   seemingly strong objections, and as a result, numerous variations and
   hybrids have been introduced. Despite the widespread disagreement in the
   field, though, a near consensus has developed in rejecting AU as an
   absurd view. In this article, however, I will go against the grain and
   argue that AU is the theory of population ethics that we should endorse.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To obtain information from participants in the Prostate,
   Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial regarding
   their perception of the retention materials employed by the screening
   centers. Also, to determine the viability of using email or the internet
   as a data collection tool with an older population.
   Design: Three of ten PLCO screening centers queried participants towards
   the end of the study (2010) as to their opinions of the various
   retention materials and whether they would have been willing to use
   electronic communication for study activities, had the option been
   available. Setting: The questionnaires were administered by mail, and
   responses were returned to the originating screening center.
   Participants: The participants in this study consisted of all the active
   participants at three PLCO screening centers: the University of Colorado
   Anschutz Medical Campus, the University of Utah, and Henry Ford Health
   System.
   Methods: A short, self-administered questionnaire was mailed to all
   active participants at three PLCO centers (n= 41,482). This was a
   one-time mailing with no follow-up, as the responses were designed to be
   anonymous in order to obtain the most honest responses. Results: The
   response rate was 62\%. Of respondents, 97\% reported their PLCO
   experience was good or excellent. Nearly 50\% of respondents indicated
   that receipt of an annual newsletter made them more likely to
   participate; newsletter features they reported as most important were
   those that conveyed information on cancer, study findings, and how their
   data were being used.
   Results did not support study coordinators' suppositions that receipt of
   a token gift or birthday card by participants was important for
   retention. Fewer than 30\% of respondents indicated that they would have
   been unwilling to use a secure website to complete study forms.
   Conclusion: These data indicate the importance of querying participants
   rather than relying on impressions of study staff, and also indicate
   that the internet will be a viable means of data collection in future
   prevention studies that include older Americans.}},

Abstract = {{Objective This study aimed to identify the indirect benefits of health
   care preparedness funding as perceived by current and former recipients
   of the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of the
   Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response's Hospital
   Preparedness Program.
   Methods This was a qualitative inductive content analysis of telephone
   interviews conducted with regional stakeholders from several health care
   coalitions to identify their perceptions of the indirect benefits of
   preparedness funding.
   Results Content analysis of interviewee responses resulted in 2 main
   categories of indirect benefits of federal health care preparedness
   funding: (1) dual-use technology and programs and (2) impact of
   relationships on day-to-day operations. Within the dual-use technology
   and programs category, 3 subcategories were identified: (1) information
   systems, (2) clinical technology, and (3) health care operations.
   Similarly, 3 subcategories relating to the indirect benefits in the
   impact of relationships on day-to-day operations category were
   identified: (1) cooperation, (2) information sharing, and (3) sense of
   community.
   Conclusion This study identified indirect benefits of federal investment
   in hospital and health care preparedness in day-to-day operations. Major
   categories of these benefits included dual-use technology and programs
   and impact of relationships on day-to-day operations. Coalition members
   placed a high value on these benefits, even though they were not direct
   outcomes of grant programs. Further research is needed to quantify the
   economic value of these indirect benefits to more accurately measure the
   total return on investment from federal grant funding. (Disaster Med

Abstract = {{Purpose To determine whether hand surgeons could accurately and
   consistently estimate the size of partial flexor tendon lacerations.
   Materials and methods Thirty-two partial flexor tendon lacerations were
   made in the flexor digitorum profundus tendons of a fresh-frozen
   cadaveric hand. Four hand surgeons and 5 residents estimated the size of
   the lacerations. Estimates were repeated 3 days later. Magnified images
   of the laceration cross-section were used to calculate the true size of
   each laceration. Inter-and intrarater reliability were calculated using
   the intraclass correlation coefficient. Accuracy was measured with the
   mean bias error and the mean absolute error.
   Results Interrater and intrarater reliabilities were both high. There
   was a high level of consistency for both surgeons and residents. In
   terms of accuracy, there was a 3\% bias toward underestimation. The mean
   absolute error was 11\%. There was no statistically significant
   difference between the accuracy of attending hand surgeons and that of
   residents. Participants were less accurate when estimating lacerations
   close to a 60\% laceration threshold for surgical repair (lacerations in
   the 50\%-70\% range). For lacerations within this range, an incorrect
   management decision would have been made 17\% of the time, compared with
   7\% of the time for lacerations outside that range.
   Conclusions The accuracy and reliability of surgeon estimates of partial
   flexor tendon laceration size were high for surgeons and residents.
   Accuracy was lower for lacerations close to the threshold for repair.

Abstract = {{The purpose of the paper is to identify the determinants of role stress
   amongst business school professors in India and explore the coping
   strategies followed by them based on the professional experiences shared

   business schools and the practised coping strategies from the
   professors' perspective based on their narratives of lived experiences.
   We conducted semi-structured interviews with 64 professors from 29
   public and private business schools in India. Analysis of qualitative
   data resulted in the emergence of 11 themes; we make recommendations
   based on the themes for the business schools' management to assist the
   professors in alleviating role stress. As pointed out by Chong and Ahmed
   (2014), phenomenological studies are rarely used for inquiry in the
   higher education context. The insights gathered from IPA help in
   understanding the tenacious causes of role stress in the management

   of the core gene in 31 samples of HCV genotype 3a found in blood donors.
   The polymorphisms of these HCVs were clustered into five RFLP patterns
   (IV). Fifteen samples (48\%) clustered as the RFLP pattern I and ten
   samples (32\%) as pattern III profiles which have been previously
   reported. In addition, there were four samples (13\%) manifest as
   pattern II, one sample (3\%) as pattern IV, and one sample (3\%) as
   pattern V. This study provides pointers to the molecular epidemiology of

Number = {{401}},

Abstract = {{Russian criminal law has long been aware of complicity. However, a more
   concrete and legally perfect definition of complicity was described in
   the Penal Code and Criminal Correction Act of 1845. The Penal Code
   describes two types of collaborative commitment of a crime: the crime
   was committed by several people with prior agreement or without it. A
   prior agreement to commit a crime was seen as the basis for increasing
   the severity of the guilt and, thus, increasing the criminal penalty.
   Certain standards described in the special part of the Penal Code of
   1845 are analyzed as well. This part takes into account certain joint
   criminal activity that occurred outside the frames of the institution of
   complicity, but, at the same time, assumes responsibility for the
   criminal acts of several people: revolt en masse, conspiracy,
   organization of secret societies, and so on. The author devotes special
   attention to the norm that establishes responsibility for organization
   of gangs and gang crimes, considering this form of participation in
   crimes to be the essence of modem organized groups. Through this precise
   lens the author analyzed gangs as a form of joint criminal activity
   described in the wording of the Criminal Law of 1903. The author notes
   that the development of the Soviet criminal law happened quite actively.
   In this context he analyzed documents having to do with the early years
   of Soviet rule and noticed that, ignoring their large quantity, the
   starting point of the development of the Soviet criminal law and the
   institution of complicity are the ``Guiding Principles of Criminal Law
   in the RSFSR{''} of December 12th, 1919. This document is then analyzed
   quite extensively. The law analyzes the institutional norms of joint
   criminal activity described in the Criminal Code of the RSFSR of 1922,
   the Criminal Code of the RSFSR of 1926, and other such documents that in
   one way or the next touch upon this topic, whether it is joint criminal
   activity in general or participation in criminal activity as part of an
   organized group.}},

Abstract = {{Among the more recent applications for natural language processing
   algorithms has been the analysis of spoken language data for diagnostic
   and remedial purposes, fueled by the demand for simple, objective, and
   unobtrusive screening tools for neurological disorders such as dementia.
   The automated analysis of narrative retellings in particular shows
   potential as a component of such a screening tool since the ability to
   produce accurate and meaningful narratives is noticeably impaired in
   individuals with dementia and its frequent precursor, mild cognitive
   impairment, as well as other neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental
   disorders. In this article, we present a method for extracting narrative
   recall scores automatically and highly accurately from a word-level
   alignment between a retelling and the source narrative. We propose
   improvements to existing machine translation-based systems for word
   alignment, including a novel method of word alignment relying on random
   walks on a graph that achieves alignment accuracy superior to that of
   standard expectation maximization-based techniques for word alignment in
   a fraction of the time required for expectation maximization. In
   addition, the narrative recall score features extracted from these
   high-quality word alignments yield diagnostic classification accuracy
   comparable to that achieved using manually assigned scores and
   significantly higher than that achieved with summary-level text
   similarity metrics used in other areas of NLP. These methods can be
   trivially adapted to spontaneous language samples elicited with
   non-linguistic stimuli, thereby demonstrating the flexibility and
   generalizability of these methods.}},

   cells}},
Journal = {{EPIGENETICS \& CHROMATIN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: In female mice, while the presence of two-active
   X-chromosomes characterises pluripotency, it is not tolerated in most
   other cellular contexts. In particular, in the trophoblastic lineage,
   impairment of paternal X (X-P) inactivation results in placental
   defects.
   Results: Here, we show that Trophoblast Stem (TS) cells can undergo a
   complete reversal of imprinted X-inactivation without detectable change
   in cell-type identity. This reversal occurs through a reactivation of
   the XP leading to TS clones showing two active Xs. Intriguingly, within
   such clones, all the cells rapidly and homogeneously either
   re-inactivate the XP or inactivate, de novo, the X-M.
   Conclusion: This secondary non-random inactivation suggests that the
   two-active-X states in TS and in pluripotent contexts are epigenetically
   distinct. These observations also reveal a pronounced plasticity of the
   TS epigenome allowing TS cells to dramatically and accurately reprogram
   gene expression profiles. This plasticity may serve as a back-up system
   when X-linked mono-allelic gene expression is perturbed.}},

Title = {{Factors affecting communication in emergency departments: doctors and

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study investigates clinicians' views of
   clinician-patient and clinician-clinician communication, including key
   factors that prevent clinicians from achieving successful communication
   in a large, high-pressured trilingual Emergency Department (ED) in Hong
   Kong.
   Methods: Researchers interviewed 28 doctors and nurses in the ED. The
   research employed a qualitative ethnographic approach. The interviews
   were audio-recorded, transcribed, translated into English and coded
   using the Nvivo software. The researchers examined issues in both
   clinician-patient and clinician-clinician communication. Through
   thematic analyses, they identified the factors that impede communication
   most significantly, as well as the relationship between these factors.
   This research highlights the significant communication issues and
   patterns in Hong Kong EDs.
   Results: The clinician interviews revealed that communication in EDs is
   complex, nuanced and fragile. The data revealed three types of
   communication issues: (1) the experiential parameter (i.e. processes and
   procedures), (2) the interpersonal parameter (i.e. clinicians'
   engagements with patients and other clinicians) and (3) contextual
   factors (i.e. time pressures, etc.). Within each of these areas, the
   specific problems were the following: compromises in knowledge transfer
   at key points of transition (e.g. triage, handover), inconsistencies in
   medical record keeping, serious pressures on clinicians (e.g. poor
   clinician-patient ratio and long working hours for clinicians) and a
   lack of focus on interpersonal skills.
   Conclusions: These communication problems (experiential, interpersonal
   and contextual) are intertwined, creating a complex yet weak
   communication structure that compromises patient safety, as well as
   patient and clinician satisfaction. The researchers argue that hospitals
   should develop and implement best-practice policies and educational
   programmes for clinicians that focus on the following: (1) understanding
   the primary causes of communication problems in EDs, (2) accepting the
   tenets and practices of patient-centred care, (3) establishing clear and
   consistent knowledge transfer procedures and (4) lowering the
   patient-to-clinician ratio in order to create the conditions that foster
   successful communication. The research provides a model for future
   research on the relationship between communication and the quality and
   safety of the patient safety.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyses the issue of the dynamics of the TARGET2 system
   balances during the sovereign debt crisis, when some countries
   registered a decisive inflow of the central bank liquidity and others
   showed an outflow. The dynamics in the TARGET2 are here explained as
   being due to a fall in the level of confidence in the capacity of the
   Economic and Monetary Union to survive, rather than to disparities in
   the level of competitiveness among countries of the Eurozone. This
   crisis of confidence has to be considered as the consequence of the
   implicit refusal of the European institutions to create a mechanism
   working as lender of last resort for the euro area member States;
   indeed, only when the ECB took this responsibility by launching the
   Outright Monetary Transactions clear signs of improvement were observed
   in the sovereign debt crisis.}},

Abstract = {{Zr and Zr+Fe co-doped ZnO nanopowders were synthesized using a simple
   soft chemical method keeping the doping level of Zr as constant (3 at\%)
   and varying the doping level of Fe (1,5and 10 at\%) in the precursor
   solution. The XRD studies reveal that the synthesized nanopowders
   exhibit hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO. The crystallite size of
   ZnO:Zr nanopowders is found to be 63 nm and then the size decreases
   gradually with the increase in the Fe doping level and attains a minimum
   of 28 nm at 10 at\% of Fe doping level. The Zr doped ZnO nanopowders are
   found to have ferromagnetic property. The material exhibits paramagnetic
   nature up to 5 at\% of Fe doping level. At 10 at\% of Fe doping level
   superparamagnetic behavior is observed. The antibacterial efficiency
   against two different bacterial strains viz Bacillus subtilis and
   Escherichia coli is studied. The antibacterial efficiency is found to be
   the maximum at 10 at\% of Fe doping level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and

Abstract = {{Background: Treatment of glenohumeral osteoarthritis in young patients
   is challenging. Total shoulder arthroplasty reliably addresses pain and
   dysfunction but compromises glenoid bone stock. Various efforts have
   been made to avoid a prosthetic glenoid component or to prevent glenoid
   erosion after hemiarthroplasty. Capsular interposition, meniscal
   allograft, and more recently, GraftJacket (Wright Medical Technology
   Inc, Arlington, TN, USA), a human dermal collagen allograft, have been
   proposed for interposition arthroplasty in young patients with
   glenohumeral osteoarthritis.
   Methods: From 2009 to 2010, GraftJacket was used for glenoid resurfacing
   combined with humeral resurfacing or a stemmed hemiarthroplasty in 6
   patients with a mean age of 47 years (34-57 years). Before GraftJacket
   was available, 5 patients were treated with a meniscal allograft and 6
   with capsular interposition arthroplasty.
   Results: At a mean of 16 months (9-22 months) after the GraftJacket was
   implanted, 5 of the 6 patients were revised to a total shoulder
   arthroplasty or a reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. The sixth patient
   was dissatisfied but declined further surgery. The mean relative,
   preoperative Constant score decreased from 35\% (range, 13\%-61\%) to
   31\% (range, 15\%-43\%) at revision or latest follow-up. Of the 5
   patients with meniscal allograft, 3 underwent revision at a mean of 22
   months (range, 12-40 months), and 4 of the 6 patients with capsular
   interposition were revised at a mean of 34 months (range, 23-45 months).
   The mean relative Constant scores preoperatively and at revision or
   latest follow-up were 44\% (range, 19\%68\%) and 58\% (range, 9\%-96\%)
   for the meniscal allograft patients and 47\% (range, 38\%-62\%) and 63\%
   (range, 32\%-92\%) for the capsular interposition cases.
   Conclusion: In our hands, 3 different types of biological resurfacings
   combined with humeral hemiarthroplasty have an unacceptable early
   failure rate. (C) 2015 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of

Abstract = {{The biological functions and molecular mechanisms of miR-223 action in
   liver cells and liver diseases remain unclear. We therefore determined
   the effect and mechanism of action of miR-233 in Fas-induced hepatocyte
   apoptosis and liver injury. Wild-type (WT) and miR-223 knockout (KO)
   mice were treated i.p. with 0.5 mu g/g body weight anti-Fas antibody
   Jo2, and the animals were monitored for survival and the extent of Liver
   injury. Although WT mice died 4 to 6 hours after Jo2 injection (n = 6),
   all of the miR-223 KO mice (n = 6) survived. In comparison to WT mice,
   the miR-223 KO mice showed resistance to Fas-induced Liver injury, as
   indicated by less tissue damage under histopathological examination,
   fewer apoptotic hepatocytes under caspase-3 immunostaining, and less
   elevation of serum transaminases. miR-223 KO Livers showed less
   caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activation and Less poly
   (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage compared with WT Livers (P < 0.05).
   Furthermore, tail vein injection of miR-223 Lentiviral vector to miR-223
   KO mice restored Jo2-induced liver injury. Transfection of miR-223 KO
   hepatocytes with miR-223 mimic enhanced Jo2-induced activation of
   caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9, whereas transfection of WT
   hepatocytes with the miR-223 inhibitor attenuated Jo2-induced apoptosis.
   These findings demonstrate that miR-223 deficiency protects against
   Fas-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and Liver injury. Further in vitro and
   in vivo data indicate that miR-223 regulates Fas-induced hepatocyte
   apoptosis and liver injury by targeting the insulin-like growth factor 1
   receptor.}},

   outliers that arise from the pedestrian's feet and legs in the images.
   Moreover, a self-pruning linear regression mechanism is presented in
   gait modeling process to attenuate the adverse effects of abnormal
   samples. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
   can achieve better performance compared with the existing methods in
   terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, complex scenario
   experiments where the textures of the ground changed, were also

Abstract = {{In this paper, an exact reconstruction formula is presented for
   near-field three-dimensional (3D) planar millimeter-wave (MMW)
   holographic imaging. The proposed formula is derived based on scalar
   diffraction theory, and the round-trip imaging process is equivalent to
   a unidirectional optical field propagation. Because of compensating the
   propagation loss of the source for the near-field imaging configuration,
   the inconsistency in range domain of the reconstructed 3D images is
   avoided. The proposed reconstruction formula also gives a phase
   correction for the reconstructed complex-valued reflectivity of the
   target and the range coordinate can be exactly determined. Simulations
   and laboratory imaging experiments are performed to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed reconstruction formula.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1) is one of the most important genes
   in human familial breast cancer, which also plays an important role in
   canine mammary tumors. The objectives of this study were to determine
   the promoter sequence of canine BRCA1, to investigate its promoter
   mutation status and to describe BRCA1 expression pattern in canine
   mammary tumors. The promoter sequence of canine BRCA1 was acquired by
   aligning human BRCA1 promoter sequence with canine genomic sequence and
   confirmed by standard promoter activity analysis. Same as human BRCA1
   promoter, the CAAT box and G/C box were found in canine BRCA1 promoter.
   In order to explore the mutation status of the promoter region and to
   investigate the expression pattern of this gene, 10 normal canine
   mammary tissues, 15 benign mammary tumors and 15 malignant mammary
   tumors were used. By sequencing, 46.7\% of the malignant mammary tumors
   were found with a deletion of one cytosine in the promoter region. The
   mRNA expression of BRCA1 was significantly reduced in benign and
   malignant mammary tumors (P< 0.05), and the protein expression of BRCA1
   was significantly reduced in malignant mammary tumors (P< 0.05). This
   study is the first time to determine the canine BRCA1 promoter sequence
   and to describe the promoter mutation status in canine mammary tumors.

   the existence of non-thermal effects in microwave heating process

Journal = {{PHARMACOLOGY RESEARCH \& PERSPECTIVES}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a sensor of
   nociceptive stimuli, expressed predominantly in a subpopulation of
   peptidergic sensory neurons which co-express the noxious heat-sensor
   transient receptor potential vanilloid 1. In this study, we describe a
   spinal cord synaptosome-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release
   assay for examining activation of TRPA1 natively expressed on the
   central terminals of dorsal root ganglion neurons. We have shown for the
   first time that activation of TRPA1 channels expressed on spinal cord
   synaptosomes by a selection of agonists evokes a concentration-dependent
   release of CGRP which is inhibited by TRPA1 antagonists. In addition,
   our results demonstrate that depolarization of spinal cord synaptosomes
   by a high concentration of KCl induces CGRP release via a T-type calcium
   channeldependent mechanism whilst TRPA1-induced CGRP release functions
   independently of voltage-gated calcium channel activation. Finally, we
   have shown that pre-treatment of synaptosomes with the opioid agonist,
   morphine, results in a reduction of depolarization-induced CGRP release.
   This study has demonstrated the use of a dorsal spinal cord homogenate
   assay for investigation of natively expressed TRPA1 channels and for
   modulation of depolarizing stimuli at the level of the dorsal spinal
   cord.}},

Abstract = {{We prove using invariance under the modular S- and ST-transformations
   that every unitary two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) having
   only even-spin primary operators (with no extended chiral algebra and
   with right-and left-central charges c, (c) over tilde > 1) contains a
   primary operator with dimension Delta(1) satisfying 0 < Delta(1) < c
   +(c) over tilde /24 + 0.09280.... After deriving both analytical and
   numerical bounds, we discuss how to extend our methods to bound higher
   conformal dimensions before deriving lower and upper bounds on the
   number of primary operators in a given energy range. Using the
   AdS(3)/CFT2 dictionary, the bound on Delta(1) proves the lightest
   massive excitation in appropriate theories of 3D matter and gravity with
   cosmological constant Lambda < 0 can be no heavier than 1/8G(N) + O
   (root-Lambda); the bounds on the number of operators are related via
   AdS/CFT to the entropy of states in the dual gravitational theory. In
   the flat-space approximation, the limiting mass is exactly that of the
   lightest BTZ black hole.}},

Title = {{Towards non-monotonic sentence alignment}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{323}},
Pages = {{34-47}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{All previous works on sentence alignment were founded on the
   monotonicity assumption that coupled sentences occur in a similar
   sequential order on the two sides of bilingual parallel corpora (i.e.,
   bitexts), leaving out the non-monotonicity in naturally-occurring
   bitexts. This paper presents the very first attempt to specifically
   address this practical issue in sentence alignment, by taking advantage
   of two observations: (1) an initial (or seed) alignment can be made
   available using accessible lexical resources and (2) sentences with high
   affinity in one language tend to have their counterparts with similar
   affinity in the other. They are incorporated as two constraints into
   semisupervised learning to formulate a novel and generalized solution
   for both monotonic and non-monotonic sentence alignment. Our evaluation
   on real-world data from two remote domains and an end-to-end MT
   evaluation show that while representative monotonic aligners suffer more

Abstract = {{A joint power splitting and beamforming design for multiuser
   multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems where receivers have
   capability of decoding information and harvesting energy simultaneously
   from received signals is considered. The objective is to maximize the
   ratio of the achieved utility to the total power consumption subject to
   harvested power requirements and power budget at a base station (BS).
   The utility function of interest combines the sum rate and the total
   harvested power. The design problem is nonconvex, and thus, global
   optimality is difficult to achieve. To solve this problem locally we
   first convert the problem into a more tractable form, and then propose
   an iterative algorithm which is guaranteed to achieve a
   Karush-Kuhn-Tucker solution. Numerical results are provided to
   demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of
   postural sway variability as a potential assessment to detect altered
   postural sway in youth with symptoms related to a concussion. Methods:
   Forty participants (20 who were healthy and 20 who were injured) aged 10
   to 16 years were assessed using the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS)
   and postural sway variability analyses applied to center-of-pressure
   data captured using a force plate. Results: Significant differences were
   observed between the 2 groups for postural sway variability metrics but
   not for the BESS. Specifically, path length was shorter and Sample and
   Renyi Entropies were more regular for the participants who were injured
   compared with the participants who were healthy (P < .05). Conclusion:
   The results of this study indicate that postural sway variability may be
   a more valid measure than the BESS to detect postconcussion alterations
   in postural control in young athletes.}},

Abstract = {{Background and ObjectiveThe angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor has been
   implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bone disorders. This
   study aimed to investigate the effect of an AT1 receptor antagonist in
   infection-induced and arthritis-associated alveolar bone loss in mice.
   Material and MethodsMice were subjected to Aggregatibacter
   actinomycetemcomitans oral infection or antigen-induced arthritis and
   treated daily with 10mg/kg of the prototype AT1 antagonist, losartan.
   Treatment was conducted for 30d in the infectious condition and for 17d
   and 11d in the preventive or therapeutic regimens in the arthritic
   model, respectively. The mice were then killed, and the maxillae, serum
   and knee joints were collected for histomorphometric and immunoenzymatic
   assays. In vitro osteoclast assays were performed using RAW 264.7 cells
   stimulated with A.actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysacharide (LPS).
   ResultsArthritis and A.actinomycetemcomitans infection triggered
   significant alveolar bone loss in mice and increased the levels of
   myeloperoxidase and of TRAP(+) osteoclasts in periodontal tissues.
   Losartan abolished such a phenotype, as well as the arthritis joint
   inflammation. Both arthritis and A.actinomycetemcomitans conditions were
   associated with the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-),
   interferon-gamma, interleukin-17 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1
   and an increased RANKL/osteoprotegerin ratio in periodontal tissues, but
   such expression decreased after losartan treatment, except for TNF-. The
   therapeutic approach was as beneficial as the preventive one. In vitro,
   losartan prevented LPS-induced osteoclast differentiation and activity.
   ConclusionThe blockade of AT1 receptor exerts anti-inflammatory and
   anti-osteoclastic effects, thus protecting periodontal tissues in
   distinct pathophysiological conditions of alveolar bone loss.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe the human temporal bone histopathology in
   NOG-related symphalangism spectrum disorder, a spectrum of congenital
   stape fixation syndromes caused by mutations in the NOG gene. To discuss
   implications for clinical management.
   Patient: A patient with a mutation in the NOG gene.
   Intervention(s): Removal of temporal bones, postmortem temporal bone
   computed tomography, histologic processing, and review of temporal
   bones.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Temporal bone histopathology and correlation
   with clinical, genetic, audiologic, and radiologic evaluations.
   Results: Both temporal bones demonstrated fixation of the stapes
   footplate to the otic capsule because of a circumferential bridge of
   calcified cartilage. In the right ear (unoperated), there was no
   additional abnormality of the ossicles or ossicular joints. In the left
   ear, fenestrations of the stapes footplate and the lateral semicircular
   canal were seen, consistent with a history of stapedectomy and
   fenestration procedure. Severe loss of spiral ganglion neurons
   throughout the left cochlea accounted for the profound sensorineural
   hearing loss; there was a normal number of spiral ganglion neurons in
   the right ear. In both ears, the cochleae demonstrated grossly preserved
   organs of Corti.
   Conclusion: The temporal bone pathologic correlate for conductive
   hearing loss in this patient with a NOG mutation was circumferentially
   calcified cartilage bridging the stapedovestibular joint space. The
   temporal bone histopathology findings suggest that conductive hearing
   loss related to NOG mutation should be improved after stapedectomy;
   however, care must be taken in extrapolating to all patients with NOG
   mutations because there may be variability in the pathology, especially
   given the variability of NOG spectrum disorders.}},

   had gone missing. These photographers did not have the same connections
   to the past as their parents and they produced a wide range of works
   that made a new contribution to the struggle for memory. One particular
   feature of their work was that they found new ways of using stock
   footage and family photographs to show the past they scarcely remember.
   This paper shall describe three highly significant examples of how they
   have done this: the photographic exhibitions Arqueologia de la ausencia
   (Lucila Quieto, 2001), Tarde {[}o temprano] (Clara Rosson, 2006) and
   Fotos tuyas (Ines Ulanovsky, 2000-2001). These three examples used
   creativity and reflection to save images not only from aestheticism,
   which turns images into an attractive (but superficial) substitute for
   absence, but also from blind scepticism, which considers all images to
   be fetishes, and condemns them to the domain of lies and perversity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a method for decomposing a class of convex

   feasible sets of the decomposed problems, and updating the global
   optimal value according to the value of this distance. The latter is
   found by exploiting the method of averaged alternating reflections,
   which is here adapted to the optimisation problem at hand. The method is
   specially suited for non-linear problems and as our numerical results
   show, its convergence is independent of the number of variables of each
   sub-domain. We have tested the method with an illustrative example and

Abstract = {{Introduction. - Mass hysteria is defined as the epidemic occurrence of a
   succession of physical symptoms without organic disorder or identifiable
   illness agents. The hysteria epidemic has been described since the
   Middle Ages, reported in different cultures and religions and affects
   different populations throughout the world. Few studies on the subject
   have been undertaken in Madagascar. We aim at describing in this study
   the clinical and therapeutic aspects of a mass hysteria that has
   occurred in the South of Madagascar.
   Methodology. - The study is retrospective and prospective at the same
   time. It concerns the victims of a mass hysteria that had occurred in a
   village (Ikalahazo) in the South of Madagascar, from the 6th of April
   2009 to the 7th of May 2009. Patients exhibiting clinical symptoms of
   conversive behavior and having undergone an assessment in hospital
   surroundings represent the object of this study. During the study
   period, 27 cases of young women were reported, 22 of them were sent to
   the University Hospital Center of Fianarantsoa (UHCF), a referring
   center of the region, for a thorough clinical examination. Demographic
   data, the clinical aspects and the care and treatment provided are the
   studied parameters.
   Result. - During a land ownership dissension that drags on endlessly in
   Ikalahazo village, exclusively 27 young women, between 8 and 21 years
   old, presented atypical symptoms, strange disorders. A first case
   appeared on the 6th of April 2009, that is to say a month before a large
   manifestation of the crisis. A similar case was observed two years ago,
   but it was an isolated case. The symptoms, primarily with motive
   manifestation, extended rapidly but remained however limited,
   susceptible to the ``Mpiandry{''} (literally ``shepherds{''}) advice. As
   the villagers believed that spiteful spirits were at the origin of the
   deeds, they appealed to the latter. Facing the symptoms persistence, the
   Neuropsychiatry Unit employees of the CHUF were sent to the village on
   the 6th of May 2009. The intense adhesion of villagers to a belief in
   satanic misdeeds complicated their somatic assessment, the results of
   which showed no distinctive features. At the end of the land dissension
   proceedings that was resolved in favor of the villagers, and after the
   isolation of the ``madwomen{''} in the Mpiandry's camp, no more
   pathological cases related to the above occurrence were reported.
   Conclusion. - A mass hysteria diagnosis is retained. It is favored and
   kept up by local dissensions, by the villagers' belief and its large
   media casting, thanks to the shepherds' presence. It mingles culture,
   tradition and modern psychiatry. Therefore, care and treatment of the
   disorder to be appropriate and optimal require the cooperation between
   these three spheres. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2014.}},

Title = {{Homogenization a la Piola produces second gradient continuum models for
   linear pantographic lattices}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{148-172}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the present work, we show that the linearized homogenized model for a
   pantographic lattice must necessarily be a second gradient continuum, as
   defined in Germain (1973). Indeed, we compute the effective mechanical
   properties of pantographic lattices following two routes both based in
   the heuristic homogenization procedure already used by Piola (see
   Mindlin, 1965; dell'Isola et al., 2015a): (i) an analytical method based
   on an evaluation at micro-level of the strain energy density and (ii)
   the extension of the asymptotic expansion method up to the second order.
   Both identification procedures lead to the construction of the same
   second gradient linear continuum. Indeed, its effective mechanical
   properties can be obtained by means of either (i) the identification of
   the homogenized macro strain energy density in terms of the
   corresponding micro-discrete energy or (ii) the homogenization of the
   equilibrium conditions expressed by means of the principle of virtual
   power: actually the two methods produce the same results. Some numerical
   simulations are finally shown, to illustrate some peculiarities of the
   obtained continuum models especially the occurrence of bounday layers
   and transition zones. One has to remark that available well-posedness
   results do not apply immediately to second gradient continua considered
   here. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the achieved data rate of a cooperative Multiple
   Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system in real measured channels. The
   achieved data is computed according to an iterative algorithm, which
   determines the linear transmit and receive beamforming filters that
   maximize the sum-rate. This method allows us to design the transmit
   filter with a simple algorithm. The Channel State Information (CSI) of
   all channels is assumed to be known at the transmitters, and cooperation
   between (BSs) in sharing the CSI is considered. MIMO channels in
   different scenarios were measured in a typical propagation environment
   using two BSs and four handsets, similar to smartphones, held by
   different users. Users were located at different distances from each
   other, and at different orientations with respect to each other. We
   computed the received data rate for four different groups of handsets at
   a fixed SNR of 15 dB. Using the algorithm, we investigated how the
   experimental and theoretical capacity is influenced by cross-correlation
   between the individual user linkages arising from one antenna at the BS,
   and by imbalance in the power of the different linkages. The system
   performs best when the handsets are separated by at least 1 m.
   Furthermore, both in theory and in practice, the algorithm is more
   sensitive to power imbalance rather than cross-correlation.}},

Title = {{Correlation between serum vitamin D level and cardiac function:
   Echocardiographic assessment}},
Journal = {{EGYPTIAN HEART JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{299-305}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The association between vitamin D and
   cardiovascular-diseases especially cardiac function is widely debated.
   Aim of work: To study the relation between serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D
   levels and parameters of cardiac systolic and diastolic functions in
   patients with LV systolic heart failure.
   Patients and methods: The study included 60 patients admitted to our
   hospital for management of symptomatic heart failure with systolic
   dysfunction (ejection fraction < 40\%). Venous samples were taken to
   measure serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Trans-thoracic echocardiography was
   done for all patients and parameters of systolic and diastolic functions
   were taken.
   Results: Compared to patients with vitamin D >= 20 ng/ml, patients with
   vitamin D level < 20 ng/ml had significantly higher average e',
   significantly shorter isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT), and
   significantly lower E/e', which is suggestive of a better diastolic
   function. While, also compared to patients with vitamin D >= 20 ng/ml,
   patients with vitamin D level < 20 ng/ml had higher end systolic volume
   (ESV) (p = 0.05), larger end systolic dimension (ESD) (p = 0.056),
   higher interventricular septum (IVS) thickness (p < 0.001), higher
   posterior wall (PW) thickness (p < 0.001), higher mean LV wall thickness
   (p < 0.001), and higher LV mass (p = 0.05).
   Conclusion: Vitamin D exerts biphasic effect on cardiac function
   according to its serum levels. Reduced vitamin D (< 20 ng/ml) appears to
   be associated with worse systolic functions in terms of end systolic
   volume and end systolic dimension. Higher vitamin D levels (>= 20
   ng/ml), however, seem to be linked to worse LV diastolic functions in
   terms of lower e', higher E/e' and longer IVRT. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{In this work, silane crosslinking of poly (lactic acid) (PLA) was
   studied. PLA was grafted with vinyl trimethoxysilane (VTMO) via melt
   mixing in an internal mixer, followed by a crosslinking reaction in hot
   water for different times. The effect of simultaneous hydrolytic
   degradation in hot water (70 degrees C) during crosslinking was
   monitored. Silane grafting of PLA was characterized using mixing torque
   and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. The results revealed
   that by increasing the silane (0-7 wt\%) and peroxide (0-0.5 wt\%)
   contents, the degree of grafting was increased. A peak corresponding to
   higher molecular weight in GPC chromatograms appeared in comparison to
   pure PLA due to the grafting reaction. Gel content, swelling test, GPC
   and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed to monitor gel
   structure and concurrent hydrolytic degradation. Results confirmed that
   the occurrence of hydrolytic degradation during crosslinking and gel
   content of some samples tended to zero over 10 hr of immersion in hot
   water. The effect of hydrolytic degradation was not significant up to 10
   hr and a tight gel structure was obtained. However, at longer
   crosslinking times, hydrolytic degradation was the dominant mechanism
   that leads to network defects.}},

Title = {{FIT AND MISFIT OF PLURAL SOURCING STRATEGIES AND IT-ENABLED PROCESS
   INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES: CONSEQUENCES OF FIRM PERFORMANCE IN THE US
   ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY}},
Journal = {{MIS QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recent work has shown that a firm's plural sourcing strategy, which
   determines how much it chooses to make versus how much it chooses to
   buy, requires consideration of the complementarities and constraints
   that affect the differential advantages of making and buying.
   Elaborating on this perspective, we theorize how (mis)fit between a
   firm's plural sourcing strategy of simultaneously making and buying and
   its development of information technology (IT) enabled interfirm and
   intrafirm process integration capabilities influences firm performance
   in deregulated markets. We position our theory development and empirical
   tests in the context of the power-generation segment of the U.S.
   electric utility industry (EUI), an asset-intensive industry that has
   been deregulated to promote the separation of key value chain activities
   (i.e., generation, transmission, and distribution) and the development
   of wholesale energy markets. We draw on the transaction cost economics,
   coordination costs, and IT capabilities perspectives to theorize that a
   firm achieves fit (realizing performance benefits) by increasing market
   sourcing intensity (MSI)-or, how much it buys relative to how much it
   makes- and developing IT-enabled interfirm process integration
   capability for external coordination with the market, or misfit
   (realizing performance penalties) by increasing MSI and developing
   IT-enabled intrafirm process integration capability for coordinating
   internal production. We collated data from archival sources for 342
   utility firms in the power-generation segment to construct a panel
   dataset for the period 1994-2004 on (1) firms' MSI from wholesale
   electricity markets, (2) firms' IT investment decisions to develop
   interfirm and intrafirm process integration capabilities, (3) measures
   of firm performance, and (4) several control variables related to
   exogenous shocks (i.e., regulatory change, oil crisis), region of
   operation, and firm-level factors. Our results suggest that fit between
   MSI and the development of IT-enabled interfirm process integration
   capability improves firm profitability, assessed by return on assets,
   and misfit between MSI and the development of IT-enabled intrafirm
   process integration capability extracts penalties in firm profitability.
   We also find evidence that fit between MSI and the development of
   IT-enabled interfirm process integration capability improves market
   valuation, assessed by Tobin's Q, and asset turnover, assessed by
   operating revenue/total assets. We discuss the implications of our
   findings for the development of IT capabilities to accompany a firm's
   plural sourcing strategy and the literature on IT business value.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a global surge in research on amphibians and reptiles,
   insufficient work has been completed in Pakistan. We conducted the
   present study to examine factors influencing the diversity and spatial
   distribution of herpetofauna in the Chakwal District (Chakwal Tehsil),
   Punjab, Pakistan. We gathered data from March 2011 through July 2013 in
   selected sampling sites of the study area using standard methods. We
   used satellite images to identify and classify different landscape
   features. We found that the herpetofaunal diversity varied from 2.07
   (unprotected tropical thorn forest) to 0.27 (mixed habitat in a wildlife
   sanctuary), while evenness oscillated between 1.76 (unprotected tropical
   thorn forest) and 0.21 (mixed habitat in a wildlife sanctuary). The two
   units with the highest similarity (0.82) were wetlands inside a
   protected area and wetlands outside of a protected area. Of the 12
   variables tested, the factor analysis produced seven significant
   variables (r > 0.80) influencing the herpetofauna of the study area.
   These included hard substrate, water availability, agriculture
   activities, road network, traffic, road mortality, and habitat
   conversion. The processed image of the area shows that the area is still
   dominated by natural vegetation and forest. However, the natural areas
   are intersected by road networks that make them easily accessible.
   Changes in the land-use practices such as habitat conversion for
   residential development, housing schemes, and road development may cause
   reductions in the diversity of amphibians and reptiles. Data on current
   diversity and distribution is needed for planning and we have suggested
   options for herpetofauna conservation and management.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Verrucous plaques mimicking chromoblastomycosis are
   frequently seen in dermatology outpatient departments (OPD). However, no
   scientific evaluation has been carried out till date from eastern India.
   So this present endeavour is aimed at a thorough study of those cases to
   readdress the challenges in diagnosis and management in
   chromoblastomycosis from this part of the country.
   Aim: The study is to observe the incidence of proved chromoblastomycosis
   cases from clinically mimicking conditions and to note therapeutic
   prospects by use of different antifungal agents.
   Materials and Methods: Twenty clinically suspected cases attending
   dermatology OPD were included in this study. Relevant histories were
   taken. Apart from routine hematological and biochemical investigations,
   scrapings from lesions were examined by direct microscopy with KOH wet
   mount, calcoflour white mount and fungal culture. Histopatholgical
   examination was also done. Any fungal growth was identified by growth
   characteristics and morphological features.
   Results: Sclerotic bodies were detected in five samples. Of them three
   were found to be culture positive. Two growths were identified as
   Fonsecaea pedrosoi and one as Cladosporium carrionii. Rest 12 cases were
   diagnosed as either lupus vulgaris (3 cases; 15\%), atypical
   mycobacterial infections (3 cases, 15\%), Hyper-trophic lichen planus
   (2, 10\%), Hypertrophic DLE plaque (2; 10\%), Wart (1, 5\%) or fixed
   cutaneous sporothricosis (1, 5\%), zygomycosis (1, 5\%). Three cases
   (15\%) were lost in follow up. Cases of chromoblastomycosis were managed
   with prolonged use of antifungal alone or in combination with saturated
   solution of potassium iodide and/or debridement. They were followed up
   for at least six months post treatment.
   Conclusion: A database comprising diagnostic clues and effective
   therapeutic intervention have been proposed for these rare subcutaneous
   mycoses.}},

Title = {{Variational asymptotic analysis for plates of variable thickness}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75-76}},
Pages = {{81-87}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It is a common assumption in plate theory that the effect of varying
   thickness on plate elastic constants can be simply accounted for by
   incorporating the thickness distribution in the formulae obtained for a
   plate of uniform thickness. For plates whose thickness varies linearly
   in the global directions, the variation described by a set of taper
   parameters, a plate theory has been developed using the
   variational-asymptotic method. In a first of its kind development, both
   the 8 x 8 stiffness matrix and the 3D stress and strain recovery are
   shown to contain these taper parameters explicitly, as opposed to their
   merely being present by virtue of the varying plate thickness.
   Furthermore, terms such as bending-shear and twist-shear coupling are
   shown to be present, which are typically disregarded in published works
   on tapered plates. It is later clearly demonstrated using the full 3D
   finite-element solutions from a test case that an analysis of this kind
   is needed to accurately determine the complete stress distribution. In
   conclusion, merely changing the thickness distributions in results for
   uniform plates may work for some problems but it is clearly not
   sufficient in general, nor can it guarantee good agreement with all
   aspects of plate analysis. This is because these kinds of approximations
   are not in tune with the mechanics of such a problem, as they disregard
   the tilt of the outward-directed normals in the boundary conditions for
   top and bottom surfaces. Furthermore, as always, a theory developed
   using the variational-asymptotic method does not make any assumptions
   regarding the deformation and is generally well suited for capturing
   such effects without fundamental changes in the procedure. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background: Stroke is one of the most common causes for chronic
   disability. Only 5 to 20\% of stroke survivors attain complete
   functional recovery of their affected upper extremity. The primary
   objective of this study was to investigate the effect of mirror therapy
   on hemiparetic upper extremity motor recovery and functions in patients
   with subacute stroke.
   Methods: A total of 30 participants were selected for the study. They
   were randomly assigned to Mirror Therapy Group (MTG) and Sham Mirror
   Therapy Group (SMTG) with fifteen participants in each group. All the
   participants equally took part in conventional stroke rehabilitation
   program 5 days a week for 4 weeks. In addition to the conventional
   stroke rehabilitation program, MTG participated in 30 minutes of mirror
   therapy and SMTG received 30 minutes of sham mirror therapy for the
   affected hemiparetic upper limb. The participants were measured for
   upper extremity motor recovery and functions by FuglMeyer Assessment
   (FMA-UE) and Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI) scales
   respectively.
   Results: Wilcoxon signed ranks test and Mann Whitney U test were used to
   statistically analyze the data. Spearman correlational technique was
   used to analyze the relationship between upper limb functions and motor
   recovery of hand. Based on Wilcoxon signed ranks test, the results were
   highly significant (p<0.05). On the basis of Mann Whitney U test, Mirror
   therapy group showed high significance ( p<0.05) than sham mirror
   therapy group. The Spearman's rho value was 0.65 which indicated
   moderate to maximum positive correlation between the two variables and
   the alpha level was set at 0.01.
   Conclusion: This study concludes that incorporating mirror therapy in
   subacute stroke rehabilitation program improves the hemiparetic upper
   extremity motor recovery and its functions and also motor recovery of
   hand can directly influence the upper limb functions.}},

Abstract = {{In 2011, the National Cancer Institute (NCI, USA) introduced the
   Provocative Questions (PQ) Initiative, a new approach allowing active
   researchers to define major unsolved or neglected problems in oncology
   unaddressed by existing funding. Last year, the U.S. NCI teamed up with
   the Indian Department of Biotechnology (DBT) to pilot the PQ approach in
   three cities in India. Workshop outcomes included the generation of
   fundable ``PQs{''} (perplexing questions understudied by the
   international scientific community), as well as the identification of
   several non-PQ projects and research-related issues of importance to DBT
   and other Indian funding groups. The workshops clearly indicated the
   need to expand beyond crafting ``PQs{''} when considering the best areas
   for research funding in international settings. Nonetheless, the first
   set of PQ workshops provided a forum to discuss key issues regarding
   cancer research in India, including the paucity of cancer research
   funding, and the lack of relevant human resource training and technology
   sharing platforms. Continued open debate between researchers, funders
   and policy makers will be essential to effectively strengthen the cancer

Abstract = {{Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is acquired by
   mammalian hosts from the environment, as quiescent endospores. These
   endospores must germinate inside host cells, forming vegetative bacilli,
   before they can express the virulence factors that enable them to evade
   host defenses and disseminate throughout the body. While the role of
   macrophages and dendritic cells in this initial interaction has been
   established, the role of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) has not
   been adequately defined. We discovered that while B. anthracis 34F2
   Sterne endospores germinate poorly within non-activated human PMNs,
   these phagocytes exhibit rapid microbicidal activity toward the outgrown
   vegetative bacilli, independent of superoxide and nitric oxide. These
   findings suggest that a non-free radical pathway kills B. anthracis
   bacilli. We also find in PMNs an autophagic mechanism of bacterial
   killing based on the rapid induction of LC-3 conversion, beclin-1
   expression, sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) degradation and inhibition of
   bactericidal activity by the inhibitor, 3-methyladenine. These findings
   extend to PMNs an autophagic bactericidal mechanism previously described
   for other phagocytes.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, a comparative study of the detailed phenolic
   profile of fruit and juice samples from an Asturian cider apple breeding
   program was carried out. To achieve this, a fast, selective and
   sensitive UHPLC-DAD strategy was developed and validated. The proposed
   method allowed determining 49 polyphenols in apple samples and 41
   phenolic compounds in apple juice samples in 18 min. Furthermore, six
   minor flavonoids have been quantified for the first time in apples:
   phloretin-hexosyl-hexoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-galactoside,
   isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-arabinopyranoside,
   isorhamnetin-3-O-arabinofuranoside and isorhamnetin-3-O-rhamnoside. The
   selectivity and reliability of this methodology allowed us to apply it
   in a successful manner to select the most interesting descendants from a
   progeny of `Meana' x `Florina' (a cider and a dessert apple,
   respectively) in terms of their phenolic composition. Descendants
   X9701-349, 119, 370, 120 and 069 could be proposed for cider production,
   since they exhibited a higher phenolic content than `Meana' apple juice.
   Although flavan-3-ol, procyanidin and dihydrochalcone levels were
   similar to those observed in `Meana' apple, flavonol levels increased
   slightly. Furthermore, it is worth noting that hydroxycinnamic acid
   concentration was up to three times higher. This fact could lead to an
   increase in cider astringency and color, as well as in cider aroma.
   Thus, this methodology is proposed to be applicable to the determination
   of the phenolic profile in other fruit and/or plant extracts.}},

Abstract = {{ALA (5-aminolevulinic acid) is an important intermediate in the
   synthesis of tetrapyrroles and the use of ALA has been gradually
   increasing in many fields, including medicine and agriculture. In this
   study, improved biological production of ALA in Corynebacterium
   glutamicum was achieved by overexpressing glutamate-initiated C-5
   pathway. For this purpose, copies of the glutamyl t-RNA reductase HemA
   from several bacteria were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis of which
   a HemA version from Salmonella typhimurium exhibited the highest ALA
   production. Cultivation of the HemA-expressing strain produced
   approximately 204 mg/L of ALA, while co-expression with HemL
   (glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase) increased ALA concentration
   to 457 mg/L, representing 11.6- and 25.9-fold increases over the control
   strain (17 mg/L of ALA). Further effects of metabolic perturbation were
   investigated, leading to penicillin addition that further improves ALA
   production to 584 mg/L. In an optimized flask fermentation, engineered
   C. glutamicum strains expressing the HemA and hemAL operon produced up
   to 1.1 and 2.2 g/L ALA, respectively, under glutamate-producing
   conditions. The final yields represent 10.7- and 22.0-fold increases
   over the control strain (0.1 g/L of ALA). From these findings, ALA
   biosynthesis from glucose was successfully demonstrated and this study
   is the first to report ALA overproduction in C glutamicum via metabolic
   engineering. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Leishmania donovani is the known causative agent of both cutaneous (CL)
   and visceral leishmaniasis in Sri Lanka. CL is considered to be
   under-reported partly due to relatively poor sensitivity and specificity
   of microscopic diagnosis. We compared robustness of three previously
   described polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods to detect
   Leishmania DNA in 38 punch biopsy samples from patients presented with
   suspected lesions in 2010. Both, Leishmania genus-specific JW11/JW12
   KDNA and LITSR/L5.8S internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 PCR assays
   detected 92\% (35/38) of the samples whereas a KDNA assay specific for
   L. donovani (LdF/LdR) detected only 71\% (27/38) of samples. All
   positive samples showed a L. donovani banding pattern upon HaeIII ITS1
   PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. PCR assay
   specificity was evaluated in samples containing Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, and human DNA, and there was no
   cross-amplification in JW11/JW12 and LITSR/L5.8S PCR assays. The LdF/LdR
   PCR assay did not amplify M. leprae or human DNA although 500 bp and 700
   bp bands were observed in M. tuberculosis samples. In conclusion, it was
   successfully shown in this study that it is possible to diagnose Sri
   Lankan CL with high accuracy, to genus and species identification, using
   Leishmania DNA PCR assays.}},

Abstract = {{N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GlmU) is a pivotal
   bifunctional enzyme, its N and C terminal domains catalyzes
   uridyltransferase and acetyltransferase activities, respectively. Final
   product of GlmU catalyzed reaction,
   uridine-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), acts as sugar donor
   providing GlcNAc residues in the synthesis of peptidoglycan and a
   disaccharide linker (D-N-GlcNAc-1-rhamnose), the key structural
   components of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) cell wall. In
   the present study, we have searched new inhibitors against
   acetyltransferase activity of M. tuberculosis GlmU. A subset of 1607
   synthetic compounds, selected through dual approach i.e., in-silico and
   whole cell screen against 20,000 compounds from ChemBridge library, was
   further screened using an in-vitro high throughput bioassay to identify
   inhibitors of acetyltransferase domain of M. tuberculosis GlmU. Four
   compounds were found to inhibit GlmU enzyme specific to
   acetyltransferase activity, with IC50 values ranging from 9 to 70 mM.
   Two compounds (6624116, 5655606) also exhibited whole cell activity
   against drug susceptible as well as drug resistant M. tuberculosis.
   These two compounds also exhibited increased anti-TB activity when
   tested in combination with rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol, however
   5655606 was cytotoxic to eukaryotic cell line. These results demonstrate

Abstract = {{Defects are ubiquitous in nanomaterials and it is critical to understand
   and control defect densities in these materials for electronic,
   chemical, and mechanical applications. Until now the relationship
   between nanomaterial structure and defect density during synthesis was
   limited to theoretical studies with no experimental confirmation of the
   predictions. Here we study defect evolution during the synthesis of
   individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) using in situ Raman
   spectroscopy. SWCNTs are an important class of nanomaterials, and offer
   the unique ability to study the effect of their chiral angle on defect
   evolution during growth - a widely explored theoretical area that still
   lacks experimental confirmation. Our data reveals the first experimental
   evidence of chiral angle dependence on the defect density in SWCNTs,
   with lower defect density for higher chiral angle SWCNTs despite their
   faster growth rate. Modeling of the kinetics of defect generation
   reveals formation energy as the critical factor driving steady-state
   defect densities, with higher formation energies for topological defects
   in higher chiral angle SWCNTs and lower energies for low chiral angle
   SWCNTs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{C-type lectins (CTLs) represent a large family of proteins that can bind
   carbohydrate moieties normally in a calcium-dependent manner. CTLs play
   important roles in mediating cell adhesion and the recognition of
   pathogens in the immune system. In the present study, we have identified
   23 CTL genes in domestic silkworm Bombyx mon. CTL-domain proteins
   (CTLDPs) are classified into three groups based on the number of
   carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) and the domain architectures.
   These include twelve CTL-S (Single-CRD), six immulectins (Dual-CRD) and
   five CTL-X (CRD with other domains). We studied their phylogenetic
   features, analyzed the conserved residues, predicted tertiary
   structures, and examined the tissue expression profile and immune
   inducibility. Through bioinformatics analysis, we have putatively
   identified ten secretory and two cytoplasmic CTL-S; four secretory and
   two cytoplasmic immulectins; one secretory, one cytoplasmic and three
   transmembrane forms of CTL-X. Most B. mori CTLDPs form monophyletic
   groups with orthologs from Lepidoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera and
   Hymenoptera species. Immulectins of B. mori and Manduca sexta evolved
   from common ancestor genes perhaps due to gene duplication events of
   CTL-S ancestor genes. Homology modeling revealed that the overall
   structures of B. mori CTL domains are analogous to those of humans with
   a variable loop region. We examined the expression profile. of CTLDP
   genes in naive and immune-stimulated tissues. The expression and
   induction of CTLDP genes were related to the tissues and microorganisms.
   Together, our gene identification, sequence comparison, phylogenetic
   analysis, homology modeling and expression analysis laid a good
   foundation for the further studies of B. mori CTLDPs and comparative
   genomics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetic interactions between
   quinine and lopinavir boosted with ritonavir (LPV/r) in healthy Thai
   adults (8 males and 12 females). Period 1 (day 1): subjects received a
   single oral dose of 600 mg quinine sulfate. Period 2: subjects received
   LPV/r (400/100 mg) twice daily. Period 3: subjects received a single
   quinine sulfate dose plus LPV/r twice a day. Intensive blood sampling
   was performed during each phase. Quinine AUC(0-48)h (area under the
   plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 48 hours),
   AUC(0-infinity) (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from
   time 0 to infinity), and Cmax (maximum concentration over the time-span
   specified), were 56\%, 57\%, and 47\% lower, respectively, in the
   presence of LPV/r. 3-Hydroxyquinine AUC(0-48)h, AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax
   were significantly lower and the metabolite-to-parent ratio was
   significantly reduced. Lopinavir and ritonavir exposures were not
   significantly reduced with quinine coadministration, but C-max of both
   drugs were significantly lower. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) and 90\%
   CI of AUC(0-48h), AUCO(3) and C-max for quinine, 3-hydroxyquinine,
   lopinavir, and ritonavir lay outside the bioequivalent range of
   0.8-1.25. Drug treatments during all periods were generally well
   tolerated. The reduction in systemic exposure of quinine and
   3-hydroxyquinine with concomitant LPV/r use raises concerns of
   suboptimal exposure. Studies in HIV/malaria coinfection patients are
   needed to determine the clinical impact to decide if any change to the
   quinine dose is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{This paper experimentally studies the disposition effects of teams and
   individuals. The disposition effect describes the phenomenon that
   investors are reluctant to realize losses, whereas winners are sold too
   early. Our experiments compare the investments of two-person teams to a
   setting, where investors trade alone. We find that subjects investing
   jointly exhibit more pronounced disposition effects than individuals. A
   closer look reveals that investor teams hardly realize losses and
   predominately sell winners. The data suggest that decision-dependent
   emotions may explain the differences. That is, teams reporting high
   levels of regret exhibit significantly higher disposition effects than
   individuals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disorder affecting millions of
   people. Most scaffolds developed for cartilage regeneration fail due to
   vascularization and matrix mineralization. In this study we present a
   chondrogenic extracellular matrix (ECM) incorporated collagen/chitosan
   scaffold (chondrogenic ECM scaffold) for potential use in cartilage
   regenerative therapy. Biochemical characterization showed that these
   scaffolds possess key pro-chondrogenic ECM components and growth
   factors. MRI characterization showed that the scaffolds possess
   mechanical properties and diffusion characteristics important for
   cartilage tissue regeneration. In vivo implantation of the chondrogenic
   ECM scaffolds with bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
   triggered chondrogenic differentiation of the MSCs without the need for
   external stimulus. Finally, results from in vivo MRI experiments
   indicate that the chondrogenic ECM scaffolds are stable and possess MR
   properties on par with native cartilage. Based on our results, we
   envision that such ECM incorporated scaffolds have great potential in
   cartilage regenerative therapy. Additionally, our validation of MR
   parameters with histology and biochemical analysis indicates the ability
   of MRI techniques to track the progress of our ECM scaffolds
   non-invasively in vivo; highlighting the translatory potential of this
   technology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Triaxial braided structures have proliferated in many applications and
   specifically, they are extensively used as main constituent materials in
   various biomedical and composite systems. The topological nature of
   triaxial braids provides significant enhancement in mechanical
   properties which can be further tuned by elucidating the most important
   geometrical and material parameters. In this study, the geometrical
   models of various braid parameters of triaxial braided structures have
   been developed for predefined strand geometries. These braid parameters
   were then used for computing various tensile properties of triaxial
   braids. Particularly, the elastic properties of triaxial braided
   structures and their composites have been analysed by including the
   effect of axial strand crimp. Furthermore, the full set of stress strain
   characteristics of triaxial braided structures has been predicted based
   upon braid topological characteristics, constituent strand properties
   and braid kinematics. The research findings of stress strain
   characteristics of triaxial braids have been confirmed by making a
   comparison between the theoretical and experimental results. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A biomimicry approach to nanonetworks is proposed here for targeted
   cancer drug delivery (TDD). The swarm of bioinspired nanomachines
   utilizes the blood distribution network and chemotaxis to carry drug
   through the vascular system to the cancer site, recognized by a high
   concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Our approach
   is multi-scale and includes processes that occur both within cells and
   with their neighbors. The proposed bionanonetwork takes advantage of
   several organic processes, some of which already occur within the human
   body, such as a plate-like structure similar to those of red blood cells
   for more environmental contact; a berry fruit architecture for its
   internal multi-foams architecture; the penetrable structure of cancer
   cells, tissue, as well as the porous structure of the capillaries for
   drug penetration; state of glycocalyx for ligand-receptor adhesion; as
   well as changes in pH state of blood and O-2 release for nanomachine
   communication. For a more appropriate evaluation, we compare our work
   with a conventional chemotherapy approach using a mathematical model of
   cancer under actual experimental parameter settings. Simulation results
   show the merits of the proposed method in targeted cancer therapy by
   improving the densities of the relevant cancer cell types and VEGF
   concentration, while following more organic and natural processes.}},

Abstract = {{Development of techniques for characterization of extremely thin films
   is an important challenge in terahertz (THz) science and applications.
   Spectroscopic measurements of materials on the nanometer scale or of
   atomic layer thickness (2D materials) require a sufficient terahertz
   wave-matter interaction length, which is challenging to achieve in
   conventional transmission geometry. Waveguide-based THz spectroscopy
   offers an alternative method to overcome this problem. In this paper, we
   investigate a new parallel-plate waveguide (PPWG) technique for
   measuring dielectric properties of ultrathin gold films, in which we
   mount the thin film sample at the center of the waveguide. We discuss a
   model of THz dielectric parameter extraction based on waveguide theory
   and analyze the response of thin films for both transverse magnetic (TM)
   and transverse electric (TE) waveguide modes. In contrast to other
   waveguide methods, our approach enables comparison of the material
   response with different electromagnetic field distributions without
   significantly changing the experimental setup. As a result, we
   demonstrate that TE modes have a better sensitivity to the properties of
   the thin film. For prototype test samples, optical parameters extracted
   using our method are in good agreement with literature values.}},

Abstract = {{A new carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) anchor is developed and
   tested to delay debonding in reinforced concrete (RC) beams externally
   strengthened with FRP laminate/sheet. The C-shape anchor is made from a
   commercially available CFRP grid. The anchors legs are 95 mm long while
   the spacing between the legs is adjustable, depending on FRP laminate
   and beam widths. Nine full scale RC beams, 3.0 m long, 250 mm wide and
   400 mm deep, were strengthened with CFRP laminate/sheet, with and
   without the C-anchor. The main test parameters were the type and amount
   of FRP laminate and the presence/absence of the anchor. Test results
   showed that beams with the anchor had generally 5\%-10\% higher
   debonding and failure load, and they reached higher deflection at
   failure than the companion beams without anchors. Although complete
   separation of the FRP laminate from the concrete was not observed in any
   of the beams with anchors, there was noticeable slip at failure at one
   end of the laminate. A significant outcome of the study is that anchors
   are effective in limiting the extent of debonding along the laminate,
   thus contributing to the flexural stiffness of the beam by reducing the
   extent of cracking and limiting the crack width along the beam. Finally,
   the anchor allowed the FRP to reach or exceed its theoretically
   allowable strain computed based on the American Concrete Institute (ACI)
   Committee 440 recommendation while in none of the beams without anchors,
   the FRP reached its theoretically allowable strain.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new full-automatic approach to content aware image
   retargeting is proposed. Most image retargeting approaches does not
   incorporate content information and only use local appearance
   information. However, there are some approaches which use high level
   information such as saliency regions, objects mask and depth
   information. Such methods do not use semantic labelling for each object.
   In this paper, object masks as well as their semantic class labels are
   used to propose a new approach to image retargeting. To do so, semantic
   segmentation of image is provided. Hence, a nonparametric approach to
   semantic segmentation is employed which is fast with no need to any
   learning model. This makes it simple and applicable to any dataset. To
   evaluate the proposed approach, besides presenting visual examples, we
   performed a set of subjective evaluations too. The obtained results show
   that our method outperforms other retargeting approaches.}},

Abstract = {{A growing body of research warns of the social challenges facing
   orphans. We examined this issue focusing on differences between orphans
   and non-orphans from mixed households, that is, households that comprise
   both orphans and non-orphans. We examined whether orphans reported worse
   psychosocial outcomes, caregiver interactions and health risk behaviours
   than non-orphans in mixed households. The study sample comprised 134
   children (61 non-orphans, 73 orphans; mean age=14.64, SD=1.85) from the
   Amajuba district in KwaZulu-Natal. Orphans were no worse off in terms of
   anxiety/depression (p=0.65), affability (p=0.11) and resilience (p=0.29)
   in comparison to non-orphans in similar type households. Orphans
   reported similarly positive interactions with caregivers as did their
   non-orphan counterparts (communication with caregivers about problems;
   p=0.67; caregivers' material and practical assistance: p=0.92). No
   significant differences in substance use (cigarettes: p=0.67; drugs:
   p=0.60; alcohol: p=1.00) and sexual activity (p=0.85) were observed. Our
   findings suggest that further consideration should be given to the
   child's living arrangements and caregiver attachments before and after
   parental loss as well as household composition and financial position
   when analysing differences in psychosocial and health-related outcomes
   between orphans and non-orphans in mixed households. The findings call
   for greater thoughtfulness in how we define orphanhood, as even children
   with living parents had other relatives identified as their primary
   caregivers. We emphasise caution with regard to decisions being made
   about which children are considered most vulnerable in contexts of
   poverty and high HIV prevalence, and to whom responses should be
   targeted, whether this be to orphans only or mixed households as a
   whole.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The role of the pig in the subsistence system of the Middle East has a
   long and, in some cases, poorly understood history. It is a common
   domesticated animal in earlier archaeological sites throughout the
   Middle East. Sometime in the first millennium, BC pig use declined, and
   subsequently it became prohibited in large areas of the Middle East. The
   pig is an excellent source of protein, but because of low mobility and
   high water needs, it is difficult to move long distances. While common
   in sites, the pig is rarely mentioned in texts. In contrast, the use of
   cattle, sheep, and goats is extensively documented. In the human
   subsistence system of the arid and semiarid areas of the Middle East,
   the pig was a household-based protein resource that was not of interest
   to the central authority. Sometime in the late second or first
   millennium BC, the chicken was introduced into the Middle East. The
   chicken is an even more ideal household-based protein resource and, like
   the pig, is rarely mentioned in texts. In arid and semiarid areas of the
   Middle East, the pig and the chicken compete for food and labor in the
   human subsistence system. I hypothesize that in arid and semiarid areas
   of the Middle East, the chicken largely replaced the pig because the
   chicken is a more efficient source of protein, it produces a secondary
   product, the egg, and it is a smaller package; hence, a family can
   consume one in a day or two. This made the pig redundant and available
   for use in other human systems. The pig, however, never disappeared from
   the diet of humans in the Middle East.}},

Title = {{Evidence of an IFN-gamma by early life stress interaction in the
   regulation of amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli}},
Journal = {{PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{166-173}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Since numerous studies have found that exposure to early
   life stress leads to increased peripheral inflammation and psychiatric
   disease, it is thought that peripheral immune activation precedes and
   possibly mediates the onset of stress-associated psychiatric disease.
   Despite early studies, IFN gamma has received little attention relative
   to other inflammatory cytokines in the context of the pathophysiology of
   affective disorders. Neuroimaging endophenotypes have emerged recently
   as a promising means of elucidating these types of complex relationships
   including the modeling of the interaction between environmental factors
   and genetic predisposition. Here we investigate the GxE relationship
   between early-life stress and genetic variants of IFN gamma on emotion
   processing.
   Methods: To investigate the impact of the relationship between genetic
   variants of IFN gamma (rs1861494, rs2069718, rs2430561) and early life
   stress on emotion processing, a sample of healthy adults (n = 409)
   undergoing an emotional faces paradigm in an fMRI study were genotyped
   and analysed. Information on early life stress was obtained via
   Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).
   Results: A positive association between early life stress and amygdala
   reactivity was found. Specifically, the main effect of genotype of
   rs1861494 on amygdala reactivity indicates a higher neural response in C
   allele carriers compared to T homozygotes, while we did not find main
   effects of rs2069718 and rs2430561. Importantly, interaction analyses
   revealed a specific interaction between IFN gamma genotype (rs1861494)
   and early life stress affecting amygdala reactivity to emotional faces,
   resulting from a positive association between CTQ scores and amygdala
   reactivity in C allele carriers while this association was absent in T
   homozygotes.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that firstly the genetic variant of
   IFN gamma (rs1861494) is involved with the regulation of amygdala
   reactivity to emotional stimuli and secondly, that this genetic variant
   moderates effects of early life stress on emotion processing. These
   findings reiterate the importance that inflammatory genes play in the
   interaction with early life stress and the regulation of emotion
   processing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiesel Co-Product (BCP) is a complex organic material formed during
   the transesterification of lipids. We investigated the effect of BCP on
   the extracellular microbial matrix or `extracellular polymeric
   substance' (EPS) in soil which is suspected to be a highly influential
   fraction of soil organic matter (SOM). It was hypothesised that more N
   would be transferred to EPS in soil given BCP compared to soil given
   glycerol. An arable soil was amended with BCP produced from either 1)
   waste vegetable oils or 2) pure oilseed rape oil, and compared with soil
   amended with 99\% pure glycerol; all were provided with N-15 labelled
   KNO3. We compared transfer of microbially assimilated N-15 into the
   extracellular amino acid pool, and measured concomitant production of
   exopolysaccharide. Following incubation, the N-15 enrichment of total
   hydrolysable amino acids (THAAs) indicated that intracellular anabolic
   products had incorporated the labelled N primarily as glutamine and
   glutamate. A greater proportion of the amino acids in EPS were found to
   contain N-15 than those in the THAA pool, indicating that the increase
   in EPS was comprised of bioproducts synthesised de novo. Moreover, BCP
   had increased the EPS production efficiency of the soil microbial
   community (mu g EPS per unit ATP) up to approximately double that of
   glycerol, and caused transfer of 21\% more N-15 from soil solution into
   EPS-amino acids. Given the suspected value of EPS in agricultural soils,
   the use of BCP to stimulate exudation is an interesting tool to consider
   in the theme of delivering sustainable intensification. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Autoimmune diseases are characterized by the stimulation of an excessive
   immune response to self-tissues by inner and/or outer organism factors.
   Common characteristics in their etiology include a complex genetic
   predisposition and environmental triggers as well as the implication of
   the major histocompatibility (MHC) locus on human chromosome 6p21. A
   restraint number of non-MHC susceptibility genes, part of the genetic
   component of type 1 diabetes have been identified in human and in animal
   models, while the complete spectrum of genes involved remains unknown.
   We elaborate herein patterns of chromosomal organization of 162 genes
   differentially expressed in the pancreatic lymph nodes of Non-Obese
   Diabetic mice, carefully selected by early subphenotypic evaluation
   (presence or absence of insulin autoantibodies). Chromosomal assignment
   of these genes revealed a non-random distribution on five chromosomes
   (47\%). Significant gene enrichment was observed in particular for two
   chromosomes, 6 and 7. While a subset of these genes coding for secreted
   proteins showed significant enrichment on both chromosomes, the overall
   pool of genes was significantly enriched on chromosome 7. The
   significance of this unexpected gene distribution on the mouse genome is
   discussed in the light of novel findings indicating that genes affecting
   common diseases map to recombination ``hotspot{''} regions of mammalian
   genomes. The genetic architecture of transcripts differentially
   expressed in specific stages of autoimmune diabetes offers novel venues
   towards our understanding of patterns of inheritance potentially
   affecting the pathological disease mechanisms. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Title = {{Isolating the benefits of fluid restriction in patients with heart
   failure: A pilot study}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{495-505}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Fluid restriction (FR) in persons with heart failure (HF) is
   often prescribed, yet self-regulation and the troublesome symptom of
   thirst are difficult for patients to manage.
   Aims: The purpose of this pilot study was to test an educational and
   behavioral intervention (EBI) on adherence with prescribed FR and
   outcome measures of fluid congestion, symptom distress, and health
   related quality of life (HRQL). Secondary aims were to describe the
   relationships between self-reported and objectively measured
   determinants of fluid status and symptoms, and assess the psychometric
   properties of piloted instruments, and intervention effect sizes.
   Methods: NYHA Class II-IV (n=25, 44-83 years, 56\% male, 20\% minority,
   mean EF 23.0+11.7\%) participants were randomized to the EBI or
   attention control (AC) and evaluated at baseline, 3 and 6 months.
   Results: EBI patients trended toward decreasing fluid ingestion
   (p=0.08), experienced less HF symptom frequency (p=0.13) and severity
   (p=0.06), and increased symptoms of thirst (p<0.01) across time. Whereas
   HRQL remained stable in the EBI group, it improved in the AC group over
   time (p=0.01). There were no significant differences in clinical
   measures of fluid congestion between groups.
   Conclusions: These outcomes suggest that patients receiving the EBI
   drank slightly less fluid, experienced less typical HF symptoms, greater
   thirst distress and stable HRQOL. Moderate to large effect sizes for the
   measures used were observed, and outcomes suggest that a randomized
   trial of various levels of FR would not potentiate fluid congestion but
   should specifically address preservation of HRQOL and thirst symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal solutions obtained by flux balance analysis (FBA) are
   typically not unique. Flux modules have recently been shown to be a very
   useful tool to simplify and decompose the space of FBA-optimal
   solutions. Since yield-maximization is sometimes not the primary
   objective encountered in vivo, we are also interested in understanding
   the space of sub-optimal solutions. Unfortunately, the flux modules are
   too restrictive and not suited for this task. We present a
   generalization, called k-module, which compensates the limited
   applicability of flux modules to the space of sub-optimal solutions.
   Intuitively, a k-module is a sub-network with low connectivity to the
   rest of the network. Recursive application of k-modules yields a
   hierarchical decomposition of the metabolic network, which is also known
   as branch decomposition in matroid theory. In particular, decompositions
   computed by existing methods, like the null-space-based approach,
   introduced by Poolman et al. {[}(2007) J. Theor. Biol. 249, 691-705] can
   be interpreted as branch decompositions. With k-modules we can now
   compare alternative decompositions of metabolic networks to the
   classical subsystems of glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, etc.
   They can be used to speed up algorithmic problems {[}theoretically shown
   for elementary flux modes (EFM) enumeration] and have the potential to
   present computational solutions in a more intuitive way independently
   from the classical sub-systems.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the loading frequency effects on the fatigue
   behaviour of adhesively-bonded steel lap joints. S-N diagrams of fatigue
   tests, under constant amplitude loading, were obtained for frequencies
   ranging between 2 and 40 Hz. The fatigue life for variable frequency
   tests was estimated based on constant frequency S-N curves, using a
   linear cumulative damage rule. It is possible to conclude that, for the
   higher shear stresses, the frequency presents only a marginal effect on
   fatigue life. On the other hand, for the lower shear stresses, the
   fatigue life of the adhesive joints is very dependant on the frequency
   level. Good correlations were obtained between fatigue life predictions
   and experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. A sensitive and selective method was developed and validated to
   study the pharmacokinetics of isatin.
   Methods. The blood samples were pretreated by protein precipitation
   method using methanol. Quetiapine was used as an internal standard.
   After pretreatment, the samples were assayed by LC/MS/NIS method and the
   pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by WinNonlin 5.2 using
   non-compartment model. The separation was performed on a Venusil XBP PH
   column (5 mu m, 2.0x100 mm) with an isocratic mobile phase consisted of
   methanol-water (containing 50 mM ammonium formate) (65:35, v/v) at a
   flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The Agilent G6410B triple quadrupole LC/MS
   system was operated under the multiple reactions monitoring mode (MRM)
   using the electrospray ionization technique in positive mode.
   Results. The lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) of the analyte of the
   method was 10 ng/mL. The method was linear with correlation coefficient
   >0.995. The intraday and inter day accuracy and precision of the assay
   were acceptable.
   Conclusion. This method has been applied successfully to a
   pharmacokinetic study involving the oral and intravenous administration
   of isatin to beagle dogs.}},

Abstract = {{Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and SU-8 are currently two very commonly
   used polymeric materials in the microfluidics field for biological
   applications. However; there is a pressing need to find a simple,
   reliable, irreversible bonding method between these two materials for
   their combined use in innovative integrated microsystems. In this paper;
   we attempt to investigate the aminosilane-mediated irreversible bonding
   method for PDMS and SU-8 with X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
   surface analysis and bonding strength tests. Additionally; the selected
   bonding method was applied in fabricating a microelectrode array (MEA)
   device, including microfluidic features, which allows
   electrophysiological observations on compartmentalized neuronal
   cultures. As there is a growing trend towards microfluidic devices for
   neuroscience research, this type of integrated microdevice, which can
   observe functional alterations on compartmentalized neuronal culture,
   can potentially be used for neurodegenerative disease research and
   pharmaceutical development.}},

Abstract = {{Deviations from Gaussian statistics of the cosmological density
   fluctuations, so-called primordial non-Gaussianities (NG), are one of
   the most informative fingerprints of the origin of structures in the
   universe. Indeed, they can probe physics at energy scales inaccessible
   to laboratory experiments, and are sensitive to the interactions of the
   field(s) that generated the primordial fluctuations, contrary to the
   Gaussian linear theory. As a result, they can discriminate between
   inflationary models that are otherwise almost indistinguishable. In this
   short review, we explain how to compute the non-Gaussian properties in
   any inflationary scenario. We review the theoretical predictions of
   several important classes of models. We then describe the ways NG can be
   probed observationally, and we highlight the recent constraints from the
   Planck mission, as well as their implications. We finally identify well
   motivated theoretical targets for future experiments and discuss
   observational prospects. (C) 2015 Academie des sciences. Published by

Abstract = {{This article analyses all the associate professor accreditations
   delivered by the National University Council (CNU) between 2005 and 2013
   by subjecting them to two statistical operations. The first makes
   visible the relational space between disciplines through the case of
   individuals who have been simultaneously accredited by several sections
   of the CNU. The second accounts for the strong relationship between the
   establishment of a disciplinary section and the chances of securing an
   academic position for candidates. This sheds light on an important issue
   that approaches based solely on bibliometrics tend to bypass: the
   entanglement of academic and scientific logics. Far from being random,
   multiple accreditations express both epistemological closeness and
   professional strategies. The upstream social factors that facilitate the
   disposition toward interdisciplinarity and the downstream logic of
   academic marketability to which they seem to correspond make it possible
   to understand differently the recent calls for interdisciplinarity.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the effectiveness of two cancer prevention
   interventions in improving balanced diet among French children aged
   12-14 years. The educational techniques used were taken from the
   taxonomy of behaviour change techniques (BCTs; Abraham \& Michie, 2008).
   Allocation to intervention group (intervention versus control) was
   randomised at the school-level, the intervention group received two
   interventions, each of 1-h duration, containing BCTs including advocated
   attitude, anticipated success/regret, behaviour modelling and barrier
   identification. Self-reported diet was assessed pre- and
   post-interventions. The resulting data were coded by a nutritionist and
   transformed into a novel measure representing the extent to which the
   participant achieved a balanced diet. Multilevel modelling indicated
   that, having taken into account the clustered nature of the data, gender
   and the differing socio-economic status of the participants, balanced
   diet decreased over time, b = -1.23, t(1830) = -2.79, p = 0.005, but
   this was qualified by a significant interaction effect with
   intervention, b = 1.42, t(1830) = 1.98, p = 0.047. Separate models for
   each intervention group revealed that balanced diet decreased over time
   in the control group, b = -1.25, t(1195) = -2.47, p = 0.014, but did not
   in the intervention group, b = 0.19, t(635) = 0.44, p = 0.66, suggesting
   a buffering effect of the interventions on balanced diet over time.
   These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of educational
   interventions using established behaviour change techniques, to change
   behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Endoprosthetic joint replacement is one of the most common and most
   successful operations in current medicine. With the increase in joint
   prosthesis implantations, the number of periprosthetic infections is
   also rising. Detection of the causative pathogen and its antimicrobial
   susceptibility is crucial for successful antibiotic therapy. For a
   reliable diagnosis, in addition to conventional microbiological methods
   (synovial fluid culture and intraoperative periprosthetic tissue
   samples), other methods of detecting biofilms are used. With sonication
   of the removed implant components, microorganisms are released from the
   implant surface and then detected qualitatively and quantitatively in
   the sonication fluid. The sonication is particularly useful for chronic,
   ``low-grade{''} infections in which a small number of bacteria are
   present and the biofilm adheres more strongly to the prosthesis surface.
   The sonication fluid is suitable for aerobic and anaerobic cultures, in
   addition to newer, culture-independent detection methods (e.g.,
   molecular methods, mass spectrometry, microcalorimetry). In the article
   the significance, advantages and disadvantages, and the practical
   implementation of the sonication of implants are presented and
   critically discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Pandemic influenza A H1N1 {[}A(H1N1)pdm09] was first detected in Brazil
   in May 2009, and spread extensively throughout the country causing a
   peak of infection during June to August 2009. Since then, it has
   continued to circulate with a seasonal pattern, causing high rates of
   morbidity and mortality. Over this period, the virus has continually
   evolved with the accumulation of new mutations. In this study we analyze
   the phylogenetic relationship in a collection of 220 A( H1N1) pdm09
   hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences collected during and after the
   pandemic period (2009 to 2014) in Brazil. In addition, we have looked
   for evidence of viral polymorphisms associated with severe disease and
   compared the range of viral variants with the vaccine strain
   (A/California/7/2009) used throughout this period.
   The phylogenetic analyses in this study revealed the circulation of at
   least eight genetic groups in Brazil. Two (G6-pdm and G7-pdm)
   co-circulated during the pandemic period, showing an early pattern of
   viral diversification with a low genetic distance from vaccine strain.
   Other phylogenetic groups, G5, G6 (including 6B, 6C and 6D subgroups),
   and G7 were found in the subsequent epidemic seasons from 2011 to 2014.
   These viruses exhibited more amino acid differences from the vaccine
   strain with several substitutions at the antigenic sites. This is
   associated with a theoretical decrease in the vaccine efficacy.
   Furthermore, we observed that the presence of any polymorphism at
   residue 222 of the HA gene was significantly associated with
   severe/fatal cases, reinforcing previous reports that described this
   residue as a potential virulence marker.
   This study provides new information about the circulation of some viral
   variants in Brazil, follows up potential genetic markers associated with
   virulence and allows infer if the efficacy of the current vaccine
   against more recent A(H1N1)pdm09 strains may be reduced. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Purpose: Acute kidney injury is common in intensive care units and is
   associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the
   ability of whole-blood neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin
   (wbNGAL) to predict mortality and need for renal replacement therapy
   (RRT) in critically ill patients with kidney dysfunction.
   Methods: We prospectively enrolled adult patients in 5 Canadian
   intensive care units. We measured wbNGAL at the time of enrollment to
   determine whether NGAL concentration could predict the primary composite
   outcome of death or need for RRT by day 30 in addition to other
   secondary outcomes.
   Results: We recruited 234 patients; 227 were included in the analysis.
   In a multivariable model, wbNGAL did not predict 30-day mortality or
   need for RRT (odds ratio, 1.05; 95\% confidence interval, 0.99-1.12).
   Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin was similar in patients who
   died (654 {[}303-1180] ng/mL) vs those who survived (541.5
   {[}255.5-1080] ng/mL, P=. 26) by 90 days. Whole-blood NGAL poorly
   predicted the primary outcome (area under receiver operator curve, 0.65;
   95\% confidence interval, 0.58-0.73).
   Conclusions: In a cohort of critically ill patients with abnormal kidney
   function, wbNGAL was not effective in the prediction of death or RRT
   within 30 days. These data do not support the use of this biomarker for
   the detection of clinical outcomes in this population. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the influence of situational
   variables on timing and tactics of substitutions in elite soccer. The
   sample was constituted by 677 substitutions made over the 124 matches
   played in the 2013-14 UEFA Champions League. To determine factors that
   affect substitution times, one-way ANOVA and Student's t-test were used.
   In a second instance, a chi-square analysis was carried out to establish
   if there was an association between each situational variable and the
   tactics of substitution. Data mining technique (J48 decision tree) was
   used to find optimal splits in substitution times, which lead to
   enhanced probability of success. Coaches tend to hold onto substitutions
   later when the team is ahead, but make substitutions earlier when either
   tied or behind (P<0.001). The probability that the substitution would be
   offensive in tactical terms increases when a team is behind in a match
   (P<0.001). Coaches avoiding defensive substitutions when they face a
   worse-ranked team and showing an increased preference for them when they
   face a similar-ranked opponent (P<0.05). Finally, it can be suggested
   that coaches should be aware that reverting losing scenarios apparently
   requires to change tactics early in the match.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Studies of human papillomavirus (HPV) awareness in Puerto
   Rico (PR) are limited and are of interest given low HPV vaccine uptake
   in this population. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine
   factors associated to HPV and HPV vaccine awareness among persons aged
   15-74 years living in Puerto Rico.
   Methods: We analysed data from a sub-sample of 1,476 men and women who
   participated in a 2008 population-based island-wide household survey and
   who completed an HPV module. Multivariate logistic regression models
   were used to examine factors associated with HPV and HPV vaccine
   awareness.
   Results: Overall, 37.2\% of participants had heard about HPV and 33.4\%
   had heard of the vaccine. Multivariate logistic regression showed that
   women were more likely to have heard of HPV (OR adjusted: 4.54; 95\%
   CI=3.45, 5.98) or of the HPV vaccine (OR adjusted: 6.15; 95\% CI=4.50,
   8.40) as compared to men. HPV awareness was also lower among older
   adults, persons with lower income and with lower educational attainment,
   those without children and smokers (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: In 2008, two years after the introduction of the first HPV
   vaccine in PR and the US, public awareness about HPV infection and the
   HPV vaccine was lower in Hispanics in PR as compared to other
   populations. Identified high-risk populations should be targeted in
   preventive care strategies. Future efforts should increase HPV knowledge
   and vaccine use in this population in order to maximize the impact of
   vaccination programs.}},

Abstract = {{The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment found a general decline in the
   consumption and gathering of wild edible plants, but some studies also
   observe a localized increase. Using information from interviews (n =
   1133) in seven sites in the Iberian Peninsula and one in the Balearic
   Islands, we 1) identify current trends in the consumption and gathering
   of wild edible plants (n = 56 plant-uses) and 2) analyze how cultural
   ecosystem services relate to such trends. Our data show a generalized
   decrease in the consumption and gathering of wild edible plants,
   although the trend changes significantly across plant-uses.
   Specifically, we found that -despite the overall decreasing trend- uses
   of wild edible plants that simultaneously relate to foods with high
   cultural appreciation and the recreational function of gathering remain
   popular. Our results signal that cultural services and values associated
   to the gathering and consumption of some wild edible plants are
   important factors explaining divergent trends across plant species. This
   finding reinforces the notion that cultural ecosystem services are
   deeply intertwined with other categories of services which can combine
   in complex, non-linear ways producing a variety of interdependent
   benefits. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing together 10 years of surveillance data on and material gathered
   through ethnographic engagements with a small group of 20 young people
   and families, the article interrogates tensions and complementarities in
   the ways in which divergent research modalities come to represent
   kinship, family life, and changing forms of child vulnerability over
   time. The article begins by drawing out some of the tensions between
   demographic and ethnographic modes of inquiry, exploring the divergent
   objects and values of each. The focus then shifts from these broader
   epistemological debates to explore the life of a selected ``case{''} as
   it unfolds within both a demographic database and through ethnographic
   research in one locality in South Africa. To resolve the tensions
   between these perspectives, the article concludes that we must move
   beyond a focus on empirical divergences between forms of research
   representation. Rather, we must develop more rigorous methodologies for
   critical, comparative, ``multi-sited{''} analyses of forms of experience
   and local-life worlds. Understanding the divergent insights that can be
   gained through different modes of inquiry, and the ways in which they
   shape and are shaped by everyday experiences in locality, is essential
   to coming to terms with contemporary forms of governance and everyday
   life.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Considering the rarity of umbilical cord prolapse (UCP) and
   lack of accurate data about the risk factors and health outcomes, we
   aimed to evaluate cases of cesarean section (CS) due to UCP in order to
   reduce treatment costs and provide information about the mortality and
   morbidity associated with this condition.
   Methods: Of 35,259 cases of CS performed in four hospitals during
   2004-2012, 103 cases of UCP were selected as the case group; on the
   other hand, 318 cases without UCP were classified as the control group.
   Information was extracted from patients' records and analyzed by SPSS
   version 18.
   Results: Prevalence of UCP was estimated at 0.2\%. In the case group,
   cord prolapse in the active phase of labor was reported 1.4 times (81\%
   vs 57\%-P<0.00), engagement 8 times (14\% vs 2\% -P<0.001), transverse
   presentation 8 times (6\% vs 2\%-P<0.002), grand multiparity 3.9 times
   (4\% vs 0-P<0.001), oligohydramnios 4.7 times (5\% vs. 0-P<0.0001, and
   polyhydramnios 5.9 times (6\% vs 0 -P<0.001). UCP was more prevalent in
   post-term deliveries (P<0.043). Oneminute Apgar score <7 was 3 times
   more prevalent in neonates of the case group (P<0.00). Prepartum vaginal
   bleeding was 4 times more common in the case group, compared to the
   control group; also, decreased fetal movement and heart rate drop were
   more prevalent in the case group. Mortality rate was 5.2\% in the case
   group and 1.7\% in the control group. Overall, the control group had a
   better general health at discharge, compared to the case group.
   Conclusion: A statistically significant correlation was detected between
   UCP and gestational age, active phase of labor, fetal presentation,
   engagement, parity, and amniotic fluid volume.}},

   This study evaluated the use of titanium mesh and recombinant human bone

   in the alveolar bone. Five patients were enrolled in the study; these
   patients required implant replacements for two contiguous missing teeth
   in the anterior maxilla, which lacked sufficient bone. Residual ridges
   were augmented with rhBMP-2 and titanium mesh to direct the geometry of
   the newly formed bone. Seven months later, a bone biopsy specimen was
   removed from the implantation site before osteotomy and insertion of
   dental implants. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans were
   obtained preoperatively, postoperatively (baseline), and 48 months after
   implantation to evaluate implant healing. All dental implants were
   placed in the grafted sites without the need for further bone
   augmentation. The most frequent adverse effects were facial oedema and
   oral erythema. Biopsy specimens were used to evaluate bone quality. CBCT
   scans provided a prediction of alveolar restoration and long-term
   success. The combination of rhBMP-2 and titanium mesh provided effective

Abstract = {{Introduction and Objective: The number and complexity of cardiac
   implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) have increased, as has the number
   of related complications, often leading to removal of the implanted
   system. The aim of this study was to characterize transvenous
   explantation/extraction of CIED leads in a reference center.
   Methods: This was a descriptive observational study of patients
   consecutively admitted from January 2009 to May 2014 for tranvenous lead
   extraction.
   Results: The sample consisted of 109 patients, with a mean age of 64.6
   +/- 16.62 years, 73.1\% male. The main indication for lead extraction
   was CIED infection. The mean time from first implantation to lead
   removal was 5.6 +/- 4.89 years. Blood cultures were positive in 32.8\%
   of cases and 29\% of patients had vegetations on echocardiography. A
   total of 228 cardiac leads were removed, of which 58.8\% were
   ventricular, 32.4\% atrial and 8.8\% coronary sinus. Complete clinical
   success was achieved in 97.2\% of cases, while procedural success was
   complete in 93.4\% and partial in 5.3\%. The complications reported were
   three cases of significant pocket hematoma, one of subclavian vein
   thrombosis and three of cardiac tamponade, effectively treated by
   pericardiocentesis.
   Conclusions: Transvenous explantion or extraction of CIED leads was
   highly effective. A high level of experience is an essential factor in
   the success and safety of the procedure. (C) 2015 Sociedade Portuguesa

   the present study argues operational conduct was lethargic due to the
   adoption of specious organizational heuristics. They included the
   assumption that fallout is subject to predictable atmospheric
   dispersion; fallout has noncumulative, undifferentiated effects on
   people; and downwind residents were prone to unreasoning panic. Thus AEC
   officials were continually chasing problems after they arose and in the
   absence of containment of fallout focused on containment of public
   perception and dialogue. The study concludes by highlighting the lessons
   relevant to contemporary sociotechnical activities.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern may be associated with
   lower asthma prevalence in children. We sought to corroborate these
   findings in Peruvian children.
   Methods This case-control study included children of ages 9-19 years
   living in Lima, Peru. A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was completed
   and diet pattern was analyzed using a modified Mediterranean diet score
   (MDS). Primary analysis investigated the relationship between MDS and
   asthma status. Maternal education, age, sex, and body mass index
   category were included in multivariate model. Secondary outcomes
   included asthma control, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1),
   allergic rhinitis, and atopic status.
   Results 287 participants with asthma and 96 controls without asthma
   completed a FFQ. Mean age was 13.5 years. According to the asthma
   control test (ACT), 86 \% of those with asthma were controlled (score >
   19). MDS scores ranged 6-18 (median 15). In adjusted analysis, being
   above the median MDS scores was associated with decreased odds of asthma
   {[}OR = 0.55, 95 \% CI (0.33, 0.92), p = 0.02]. Among children whose
   mothers completed secondary education, being above the median MDS
   significantly decreased the odds of asthma {[}OR = 0.31, 95 \% CI (0.14,
   0.71), p < 0.01], whereas among those whose mothers did not complete
   secondary education there was no protective effect {[}OR = 0.86, 95 \%
   CI (0.43, 1.7), p = 0.66]. There was no association between MDS scores
   and asthma control, FEV1, allergic rhinitis, or atopic status.
   Conclusion Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was inversely associated
   with having asthma among children in Lima, Peru. This effect was
   strongest among children with better educated mothers.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Renal tumor biopsy (RTB) for the characterization of small
   renal masses (SRMs) has not been widely adopted despite reported safety
   and accuracy. Without pretreatment biopsy, patients with benign tumors
   are frequently overtreated.
   Objective: To assess the diagnostic rate of RTBs, to determine their
   concordance with surgical pathology, and to assess their impact on
   management.
   Design, setting, and participants: This is a single-institution
   retrospective study of 529 patients with biopsied solid SRMs <= 4 cm in
   diameter. RTBs were performed to aid in clinical management.
   Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Diagnostic and
   concordance rates were presented using proportions. Factors that
   contributed to a diagnostic biopsy were identified using a multivariable
   logistic regression.
   Results and limitations: The first biopsy was diagnostic in 90\% (n =
   476) of cases. Of the nondiagnostic biopsies, 24 patients underwent a
   second biopsy of which 83\% were diagnostic. When both were combined,
   RTBs yielded an overall diagnostic rate of 94\%. Following RTB,
   treatment could have been avoided in at least 26\% of cases because the
   lesion was benign. Tumor size and exophytic location were significantly
   associated with biopsy outcome. RTB histology and nuclear grade were
   highly concordant with final pathology (93\% and 94\%, respectively).
   Adverse events were low (8.5\%) and were all self-limited with the
   exception of one. Although excellent concordance between RTB and final
   pathology was observed, only a subset of patients underwent surgery
   following biopsy. Thus it is possible that some patients were
   misdiagnosed.
   Conclusions: RTB of SRMs provided a high rate of diagnostic accuracy,
   and more than a quarter were benign. Routine RTB for SRMs informs
   treatment decisions and diminishes unnecessary intervention. Our results
   support its systematic use and suggest that a change in clinical
   paradigm should be considered.
   Patient summary: Renal tumor biopsy (RTB) for pretreatment
   identification of the pathology of small renal masses (SRMs) is safe and
   reliable and decreases unnecessary treatment. Routine RTB should be
   considered in all patients with an indeterminate SRM for which treatment
   is being considered. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Background Patients with cancer of unknown primary (CUP) have metastatic
   malignant disease without an identifiable primary site; it is the fourth
   most common cause of cancer death.
   Objectives To explore patients' informal and professional carers'
   experiences of CUP to inform development of evidence-based,
   patient-centred care.
   Methods Qualitative study involving development of multiple exploratory
   case studies, each comprising a patient and nominated informal and
   professional carers, with contextual data extracted from medical
   records.
   Results 17 CUP patients, 14 informal and 13 professional carers
   participated in the study. Two inter-related themes distinct to CUP
   emerged: uncertainty and continuity of care. In the absence of a primary
   diagnosis, patients and informal carers experienced uncertainty
   regarding prognosis, possible recurrence and the primary's hereditary
   potential. Professional carers experienced difficulty communicating
   uncertainty to patients, ambiguity in deciding optimal treatment plans
   in the absence of trial data and a test or treat dilemma: when to
   discontinue seeking the primary and start treatment. Common problems
   with care continuity were amplified for CUP patients relating to
   coordination, accountability and timeliness of care. The remit of
   multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) often excluded CUP, leading to MDT tennis
   where patients were bounced between MDTs.
   Conclusions The experience of those with CUP is distinctive and it can
   serve to amplify some of the issues encountered by people with cancer.
   The clinical uncertainties related to CUP compound existing shortcomings
   in continuity of care, increasing the likelihood of a disrupted patient
   journey. However, while little can be done to overcome uncertainty, more
   could be done to address issues regarding continuity of care.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This manuscript proposes pharmacological strategies that might
   decrease persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP). These recommendations are
   based on a review of current publications available in the literature.
   Principal findings Persistent postsurgical pain has been defined by the
   International Association for the Study of Pain as clinical discomfort
   that lasts more than two months after surgery. Recent reviews reported
   that 10-50\% of patients develop chronic pain after surgery, 2-10\% with
   disabling chronic pain at six months. Preventive interventions should
   target all types of surgery, but specific attention should be placed on
   surgical insults that carry a high risk of pain chronicization. Regional
   anesthesia (RA) should be used whenever feasible, and a continuous
   perineural/epidural local anesthetic infusion is preferred over a
   single-shot technique. The RA should be initiated prior to the surgical
   incision and then continued for at least 24-72 hr after the surgery.
   Perioperative opioids should be used for nociceptive stimuli not managed
   by the RA. An intravenous infusion of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate
   receptor (NMDA) antagonist, might be added for a further decrease in
   neuronal sensitization, especially when the procedure is extensive or
   when RA is not feasible or contraindicated. A multimodal approach is
   always suggested. The literature still does not strongly support the use
   of gabapentinoids for PPSP prevention; however, they might be maintained
   in patients who use them preoperatively.
   Conclusions A winning strategy to reduce the incidence of PPSP may well
   involve performing minimally invasive surgery, providing adequate
   perioperative analgesia based on RA, and using a multimodal approach
   with NMDA antagonists.}},

Abstract = {{At the beginning of the 1970s there was a drastic turn in the history of
   Hungarian folklorism brought by the `dance house' {[}tanchaz] movement.
   This movement, based on civil initiative, aimed to evoke and revive the
   patterns of peasant dance and music culture of local communities,
   preserving its aesthetic values. Within its confines, many young people
   followed the example of the initiators, Ferenc Sebo and Bela Halmos
   through the intensive appropriation of instrumental folk music. Their
   professional leaders were such folklore researchers as Lajos Vargyas,
   Imre Olsvai, and Gyorgy Martin, later the amateur activity ignoring
   scientific requirements came to play a determinant role. (N.B. the
   ``dance house method{''} was inscribed in 2011 on UNESCO's
   Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.) As
   an urban subculture rooted in the peasant traditional culture, it
   expanded independently from the centrally supervised cultural
   establishment - without the control of the communist party. It seemed to
   be dangerous from ideological point of view, because it could have
   involved the ideas of nationalism, liberty, and self-organized
   communities as well.}},

Abstract = {{Wax deposition can cause a serious problem in crude oil flow assurance,
   especially in deep water operation due to the long chain of n-paraffin.
   This paper examines the effects of two factors on the deposition

   of four different types of wax inhibitors (cocamide diethanolamine
   (C-DEA), diethanolamine (DEA), poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) and
   poly (maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (MEA) were injected into a
   crude oil vessel where the temperature of cold finger and water bath
   were set at 5 degrees C and 50 degrees C, respectively. The rotation
   speed was operated at different ranges between 0 and 600 rpm. From the
   result, it was found that the amount of total wax deposit decreased when
   shear rate increased. EVA showed a strong effect to inhibit wax
   formation with 33.33\% reduction of wax deposit at 400 rpm as compared
   to other inhibitors.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between vocabulary and memory, on the one hand, and
   comprehension of oral descriptive texts, on the other, is investigated
   in preschoolers. We hypothesized that lexical development and memory not
   only have a significant correlation with performance in comprehension,
   but these variables can also predict the performance at the discursive
   level. A study was conducted with 36 children (age range 4; 5 and 5; 7).
   Participants were tested in passive vocabulary, lexical discrimination,
   memory, and oral comprehension of descriptive texts developed ad hoc for
   this study. The results confirmed that both memory and the lexicon are
   significantly correlated with comprehension. In a regression analysis,
   however, only the lexicon (in the measures used) was a statistically
   significant predictor of text comprehension skills development. Taken
   together, the evidence supports those theoretical proposals that
   emphasize the role of vocabulary in the early development of discourse
   skills.}},

Abstract = {{This paper revisits the link between trade and wage inequality motivated
   by two changes in the structure of trade. First, trade today is shaped
   as much by the exchange of components as finished goods. Second,
   low-wage country imports into advanced economies like the US have risen
   dramatically since the early 1990s. We pay special attention to the
   timing of trade impacts. Consistent with prior work, technological
   change is confirmed as the key driver of inequality before 1990. After
   1990 the growth of wage inequality is primarily a consequence of rising
   import competition from low-wage economies. We account for the growing
   fragmentation of production using a panel model focusing on within
   rather than between-industry shifts in inequality. Lags of key variables
   are used as instruments, and our results appear robust to broad concerns
   with endogeneity and to different measures of skill-biased technological
   change.}},

Abstract = {{We studied olfactory responses of Nesidiocoris tenuis Reuter
   (Heteroptera: Miridae), an omnivorous mind bug, to volatiles from
   eggplants infested by different developmental stages of tobacco
   cutworms, Spodoptera litura Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and of
   female two-spotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari:
   Tetranychidae). We first conducted predation experiments and found that
   N. tenuis preyed on first and second stadium larvae, but not on third
   and fourth stadium S. litura larvae. N. tenuis also preyed upon T.
   urticae females that had been reported to be less suitable prey species.
   When offered first stadium S. litura larvae and T. urticae females
   simultaneously, N. tenuis, preferred to prey upon S. litura larvae. We
   then tested the olfactory responses of N. tenuis to volatiles from
   eggplants using a Y-tube olfactometer. A significant preference for
   volatiles from uninfested eggplants over clean air was found. Volatiles
   of eggplants infested by either first, second or fourth stadium S.
   litura larvae were preferred over volatiles from uninfested eggplants.
   The olfactory preferences of N. tenuis to S. litura-infested eggplants
   were: eggplants infested by 10 first stadium larvae = eggplants infested
   by 10 second stadium larvae > eggplants infested by 1 fourth stadium
   larva. Volatiles from eggplants infested by 200 T. urticae females also
   attracted N. tennis, but the volatiles were not as attractive as those
   from eggplants infested by 10 first stadium larvae. Chemical analyses
   showed that volatiles from eggplants infested by different developmental
   stages of S. litura larvae had qualitative differences. First stadium
   larvae induced higher amounts of volatiles than second and fourth
   stadium larvae, despite the first stadium S. litura larvae doing the
   least damage. T. urticae female-induced volatiles were both
   qualitatively and quantitatively different from those induced by first
   stadium S. litura larvae. The specific olfactory responses of N. tenuis
   to different prey species/developmental stages were discussed in terms
   of prey availability and biological control. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{To establish the prevalence of overweight-obesity and cardiometabolic
   risk factors (CRF) (sedentary lifestyle, dyslipidemia, hypertension and
   impaired carbohydrate metabolism) in children and adolescents in the
   city of Merida, Venezuela, we studied 922 children and adolescents from
   9 to 18 years of age, from different educational institutions.
   Anthropometric measurements and arterial blood pressure were recorded.
   Body mass index was calculated. Fasting blood glucose, insulin and
   lipids levels, and glucose and insulin 2 h post-load glucose were
   measured. HOMA-IR was calculated. In order of frequency, sedentary
   lifestyle was observed in 49.3\% of participants, dyslipidemia in
   28.3\%, overweight-obesity in 17.4\% (7.9\% obesity and 9.5\%
   overweight), pre-hypertension and hypertension (PreHT/HT) in 8.8\%,
   prediabetes in 4\%, insulin resistance in 3.9\% and metabolic syndrome
   (MS) in 2.5\%. CRF's were associated with overweight-obesity, being the
   most common, dyslipidemia (50.3\% vs 23.7\% in normal weight) and
   PreHT/HT (23.8\% vs 5.7\%; p=0.0001 for both). The risk of PreHT/HT,
   dyslipidemia, and MS were 5.14, 3.26 and 119.56 times more in
   overweight-obesity, than in low-normal weight respectively (p=0.0001 for
   all). In conclusion, the frequency of overweight and obesity in Merida
   has increased over time. Given its clear association with CRF, it is
   recommended to provide the appropriated education to improve nutritional
   status.}},

Abstract = {{The use of porosity to modify the functional properties of piezoelectric
   ceramics is well known in the scientific literature as well as by the
   industry, and porous ceramic can be seen as a 2-phase composite. In the
   present work, examples are given of applications where controlled
   porosity is exploited in order to optimise the dielectric, piezoelectric
   and acoustic properties of the piezoceramics. For the optimisation
   efforts it is important to note that the thickness coupling coefficient
   k(t) will be maximised for some non-zero value of the porosity that
   could be above 20\%. On the other hand, with a good approximation, the
   acoustic velocity decreases linearly with increasing porosity, which is
   obviously also the case for the density. Consequently, the acoustic
   impedance shows a rather strong decrease with porosity, and in practice
   a reduction of more than 50\% may be obtained for an engineered porous
   ceramic. The significance of the acoustic impedance is associated with
   the transmission of acoustic signals through the interface between the
   piezoceramic and some medium of propagation, but when the porous ceramic
   is used as a substrate for a piezoceramic thick film, the attenuation
   may be equally important. In the case of open porosity it is possible to
   introduce a liquid into the pores, and examples of modifying the
   properties in this way are given.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous observations at multiple frequency bands have the potential
   to overcome the fundamental limitation imposed by the atmospheric
   propagation in (sub) millimeter very long baseline interferometry
   (mm-VLBI) observations. The propagation effects place a severe limit on
   the sensitivity achievable in mm-VLBI, reducing the time over which the
   signals can be coherently combined, and preventing the use of phase
   referencing and astrometric measurements. We carried out simultaneous
   observations at 22, 43, 87, and 130 GHz of a group of five active
   galactic nuclei, the weakest of which is similar to 200 mJy at 130 GHz,
   with angular separations ranging from 3 degrees.6 to 11 degrees, using
   the Korean VLBI Network. We analyzed these data using the frequency
   phase transfer (FPT) and the source frequency phase referencing (SFPR)
   techniques, which use the observations at a lower frequency to correct
   those at a higher frequency. The results of the analysis provide an
   empirical demonstration of the increase in the coherence times at 130
   GHz from a few tens of seconds to about 20 minutes, with FPT, and up to
   many hours with SFPR. Moreover,. the astrometric analysis provides
   high-precision relative position measurements between two frequencies,
   including, for the first time, astrometry at 130 GHz. Finally, we
   demonstrate a method for the generalized decomposition of the relative
   position measurements into absolute position shifts for bona fide
   astrometric registration of the maps of the individual sources at
   multiple frequencies, up to 130 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{Light as a subject of thought has proved impossible to deal with
   holistically. Light is intrinsic to the farthest reaches of physics,
   psychology, philosophy, art, etc. The conceptual structures to deal with
   light have been quite complex, often resulting in contradictions and
   paradoxes, e.g., light is conceived in terms of space and time,
   themselves functions of light. Knowing light appears to leave a
   remainder. Light cannot be wholly captured by thought; the experience of
   light does not reduce to knowledge of light. Perhaps more than any other
   phenomenon, light poses problems of distinguishing between the physical
   object and the object in mind. The record of thought about light shows
   that distinguishing between subjective and objective aspects of light
   has been notoriously difficult and a recurrent effort, apparently
   necessary towards understanding light. The author argues that light
   demands the reconciliation of concept and experience, objective and
   subjective aspects; dividing these limits understanding of light. In
   developing a research method that combines both the semantics and
   architectonics of light, the author draws from his original Light Dance
   art form towards a holistic understanding of light that reflects
   mindmatter continuity.}},

Abstract = {{Later-life changes in brain tissue volumes-decreases in the volume of
   healthy grey and white matter and increases in the volume of white
   matter hyperintensities (WMH)-are strong candidates to explain some of
   the variation in ageing-related cognitive decline. We assessed fluid
   intelligence, memory, processing speed, and brain volumes (from
   structural MRI) at mean age 73 years, and at mean age 76 in a narrow-age
   sample of older individuals (n=657 with brain volumetric data at the
   initial wave, n=465 at follow-up). We used latent variable modeling to
   extract error-free cognitive levels and slopes. Initial levels of
   cognitive ability were predictive of subsequent brain tissue volume
   changes. Initial brain volumes were not predictive of subsequent
   cognitive changes. Brain volume changes, especially increases in WMH,
   were associated with declines in each of the cognitive abilities. All
   statistically significant results were modest in size (absolute r-values
   ranged from 0.114 to 0.334). These results build a comprehensive picture
   of macrostructural brain volume changes and declines in important
   cognitive faculties during the eighth decade of life. (C) 2015 The

   These compounds inhibit an early step of the replicative cycle of HIV,

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{For much of the last century, the South was a net loser of blacks and
   whites to other regions. The end of this ``Great Migration{''} occurred
   around 1970. Since then, the South is the only U.S. region to gain both
   blacks and whites through migration in every decade. As recessions often
   perturb migration systems by restraining rates of movement and altering
   patterns, this paper explores how the Great Recession of 2007-2009 and
   its aftermath affected the established migration gains of native-born
   blacks and whites within the South. We use data from the 1990 and 2000
   censuses and pooled data from American Community Survey to evaluate
   these changes. While the South continued to add both blacks and whites
   from migration during the recessionary years, key states bucked this
   trend. Georgia, for example, experienced a net migration gain of blacks
   but a net loss of whites. Florida added population in all time periods
   studied but lost large numbers of educated blacks and whites between
   2008-2010. Texas, in contrast, added both blacks and whites from
   migration no matter their age or education throughout the recent
   recession. This economic downturn, then, has disturbed long-term
   migration patterns in the South. A more nuanced set of interstate
   movements has emerged, differentiated by age and education within race
   groups, which we suspect will last for some time.}},

Abstract = {{Superoxide is the proximal reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the
   mitochondrial respiratory chain and plays a major role in pathological
   oxidative stress and redox signaling. While there are tools to detect or
   decrease mitochondrial superoxide, none can rapidly and specifically
   increase superoxide production within the mitochondrial matrix. This
   lack impedes progress, making it challenging to assess accurately the
   roles of mitochondrial superoxide in cells and in vivo. To address this
   unmet need, we synthesized and characterized a mitochondria-targeted
   redox cycler, MitoParaquat (MitoPQ) that comprises a
   triphenylphosphonium lipophilic cation conjugated to the redox cycler
   paraquat. MitoPQ accumulates selectively in the mitochondrial matrix
   driven by the membrane potential. Within the matrix, MitoPQ produces
   superoxide by redox cycling at the flavin site of complex I, selectively
   increasing superoxide production within mitochondria. MitoPQ increased
   mitochondrial superoxide in isolated mitochondria and cells in culture a
   thousand-fold more effectively than untargeted paraquat. MitoPQ was also
   more toxic than paraquat in the isolated perfused heart and in
   Drosophila in vivo. MitoPQ enables the selective generation of
   superoxide within mitochondria and is a useful tool to investigate the
   many roles of mitochondrial superoxide in pathology and redox signaling
   in cells and in vivo. (C) 2015 The Authors.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the phylogenetic and geographical history of Neotropical
   lineages requires having adequate geographic and taxonomic sampling
   across the region. However, Colombia has remained a geographical gap in
   many studies of Neotropical diversity. Here we present a study of
   Neotropical skinks of the genus Mabuya, reptiles that are difficult to
   identify or delimit due to their conservative morphology. The goal of
   the present study is to propose phylogenetic and biogeographic
   hypotheses of Mabuya including samples from the previously under-studied
   territory of Colombia, and address relevant biogeographic and taxonomic
   issues. We combined molecular and morphological data sampled densely by
   us within Colombia with published data representing broad sampling
   across the Neotropical realm, including DNA sequence data from two
   mitochondrial (12S rRNA and cytochrome b) and three nuclear genes (Rag2,
   NGFB and R35).
   To evaluate species boundaries we employed a general mixed
   Yule-coalescent (GMYC) model applied to the mitochondrial data set. Our
   results suggest that the diversity of Mabuya within Colombia is higher
   than previously recognized, and includes lineages from Central America
   and from eastern and southern South America. The genus appears to have
   originated in eastern South America in the Early Miocene, with
   subsequent expansions into Central America and the Caribbean in the Late
   Miocene, including at least six oceanic dispersal events to Caribbean
   Islands.
   We identified at least four new candidate species for Colombia and two
   species that were not previously reported in Colombia. The populations
   of northeastern Colombia can be assigned to M. zuliae, while specimens
   from Orinoquia and the eastern foothills of the Cordillera Oriental of
   Colombia correspond to M. altamazonica. The validity of seven species of
   Mabuya sensu lato was not supported due to a combination of three
   factors: (1) non-monophyly, (2) <75\% likelihood bootstrap support and
   <0.95 Bayesian posterior probability, and (3) GMYC analysis collapsing
   named species. Finally, we suggest that Mabuya sensu stricto may be
   regarded as a diverse monophyletic genus, widely distributed throughout
   the Neotropics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose With an increase in longitudinal datasets and analyses, scholars
   have made theoretical advances toward understanding desistance using
   biological, social, and psychological factors. In an effort to integrate
   the theoretical views on desistance, some scholars have argued that each
   of these views represents a piece of adult maturation. Yet to date,
   research has not empirically examined an integrated perspective. The
   purpose of this study is to conduct an exploratory examination of
   various ``domains{''} of maturation to determine whether they explain
   desistance from crime separately and as a whole.
   Methods Using the Rutgers Health and Human Development Project, a
   longitudinal study spanning ages 12-31, we develop exploratory measures
   of maturation in five domains: (1) adult social roles, (2)
   identity/cognitive, (3) psychosocial, (4) civic, and (5) neurocognitive.
   We then utilize growth curve models to examine the relationship between
   these domains and crime over time.
   Results Although each of the domains is associated with crime at the
   bivariate level, only three (i.e., psychosocial, identity/cognitive
   transformation, and adult social role) remain significant in the growth
   curve models (only two in within-individual analyses). In addition, a
   combined measure of maturation is related to crime, indicating that
   greater maturation through emerging adulthood has a negative effect on
   criminal behavior and is, therefore, a factor influencing desistance.
   Conclusions Maturation emerges as a promising approach to integrating
   the multiple theoretical views that characterize the literature on
   desistance from crime. Further research should develop additional
   domains and determine the best approach for measurement.}},

Abstract = {{Present here that Schopenhauer understands nature as a concept built by
   man, abstract and conceptual: a word. Schopenhauer reformulated
   transcendental idealism of Kant to the concepts of understanding did not
   make reference to sensitivity, because animals have experience of the
   phenomenal world, contrary to what Kant's theory leads us to believe.
   After all, in Kant, animals would have to deal with concepts to
   represent objects, which Schopenhauer denies. In Schopenhauer's theory
   our perceptions do not need the categories of understanding (concepts,
   language) to draw the object of possible experience and become
   representation. The Kantian understanding will be shown as a hybrid
   object: through representation, middle thing-in-itself, as Kant mixed
   thinking and intuition, making the experience and the dependent
   objective world of understanding (conceptual). But for Schopenhauer the
   individual object, perceptions are independent of abstract thought. The
   thought engages with concepts and abstract what is common objects,
   causing them. But the understanding is irrational, intuitive and
   perceptive.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: A future, highly renewable electricity system will be
   largely based on fluctuating renewables. The integration of wind and
   solar photovoltaics presents a major challenge. Transmission can be used
   to lower the need for complementary generation, which we term backup in
   this article.
   Methods: Generation data based on historical weather data, combined with
   real load data, determine hourly mismatch timeseries for all European
   countries, connected by physical power flows. Two localized export
   schemes determining the power flows are discussed, which export only
   renewable excess power, but no backup power, and are compared to a
   synchronized export scheme, which exports renewable excess power and
   also backup power.
   Results: Compared to no or very limited power transmission,
   unconstrained power flows across a highly renewable pan-European
   electricity network significantly reduce the overall amount of required
   annual backup energy, but not necessarily the required backup
   capacities.
   Conclusions: The reduction of the backup capacities turns out to be
   sensitive to the choice of export scheme. Results suggest that the
   synchronized export of local backup power to other countries is
   important to significantly save on installed backup capacities.}},

Abstract = {{Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) cause serious
   infections and are associated with high mortality in part due to limited
   treatment options. The in vitro activities of the new aminoglycoside
   plazomicin and comparators were evaluated against a collection of 164
   CPE (VIM-1, n= 125; KPC-2, n = 34; OXA-48, n = 4; and IMP-22, n = 1).
   MIC90 values of gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin were 256, 64 and 16
   mg/L, respectively. Plazomicin exhibited an MIC range of 0.12-4 mg/L
   with MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.25 and 1 mg/L. The MICs of plazomicin
   did not correlate with the other aminoglycoside MICs, with the
   resistance phenotype or with the carbapenemase harboured. Chequerboard
   experiments against 10 carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae
   isolates showed that combinations of plazomicin with colistin yielded
   synergy against 60\% of the strains. Synergy of plazomicin with
   meropenem or fosfomycin was detected against 20\% and 25\% of the
   isolates, respectively. Using time-kill methodology, the interactions of
   plazomicin at 2x, 1 x and 0.5x MIC with meropenem, colistin, fosfomycin
   or tigecycline at steady-state concentrations against two K. pneumoniae
   carrying the VIM-1 enzyme were investigated. Bactericidal activity was
   evident for both isolates at 2x MIC of plazomicin. Synergy was observed
   when plazomicin was combined with meropenem, colistin or fosfomycin
   against both isolates, whilst the combination with tigecycline resulted
   in indifference. Antagonism was not observed for any of the combinations
   tested. The results of this study suggest that plazomicin may address
   the need for new therapeutic options for the treatment of infections due
   to CPE. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of

Abstract = {{Antibiotic resistance is a growing concern to public health. New
   treatment strategies may alleviate the situation by slowing down the
   evolution of resistance. Here, we evaluated sequential treatment
   protocols using two fully independent laboratory-controlled evolution
   experiments with the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 and two
   pairs of clinically relevant antibiotics (doripenem/ciprofloxacin and
   cefsulodin/gentamicin). Our results consistently show that the
   sequential application of two antibiotics decelerates resistance
   evolution relative to monotherapy. Sequential treatment enhanced
   population extinction although we applied antibiotics at sublethal
   dosage. In both experiments, we identified an order effect of the
   antibiotics used in the sequential protocol, leading to significant
   variation in the long-term efficacy of the tested protocols. These
   variations appear to be caused by asymmetric evolutionary constraints,
   whereby adaptation to one drug slowed down adaptation to the other drug,
   but not vice versa. An understanding of such asymmetric constraints may
   help future development of evolutionary robust treatments against
   infectious disease.}},

   treated with rt-PA (60 kU/mL) or DSPA (2 mg/mL) combined with pulsed
   wave ultrasound (2 MHz, 0.179 W/cm(2)). To reveal the individual effects
   of medication and ultrasound, lysis rates were also determined for DSPA
   monotherapy and for combined treatment with rt-PA and ultrasound. Clots
   solely placed in plasma served as the control group. Lysis increased
   significantly with rt-PA (26.5 +/- 7.8\%) and DSPA (30.5 +/- 6\%)
   compared with the control group (18.2 +/- 5.9\%) (each p, 0.001). DSPA
   lysis was more effective than rt-PA lysis (without STL: p = 0.015, with

Abstract = {{There is converging evidence that over the course of the second year
   children become good at various fairly sophisticated forms of pro-social
   activities, such as helping, informing and comforting. Not only are
   toddlers able to do these things, they appear to do them routinely and
   almost reliably. A striking feature of these interventions, emphasized
   in the recent literature, is that they show precocious abilities in two
   different domains: they reflect complex `theory of mind' abilities as
   well as `altruistic motivation'. Our aim in this paper is to present a
   theoretical hypothesis that bears on both kinds of developments. The
   suggestion is that children's `instrumental helping' reflects their
   budding understanding of practical reasons (in the standard sense of
   `considerations that count in favour of' someone's acting in a certain
   way). We can put the basic idea in the familiar terminology of common
   coding: toddlers conceive of the goals of others' actions in the same
   format as the goals of their own actions: in terms of features of their
   situation that provide us with reasons to act.}},

Abstract = {{Found unknown radioactive material is often contained in a package so
   the chemical and physical form of the material itself is unknown, and
   the detail of the packaging is likewise unknown. Together, these present
   a significant risk on how to handle the package for destructive
   examination of its contents. Whether of nefarious origin or the result
   of less stringent practices of yesteryear the material needs to be
   properly identified and characterized for appropriate disposition.
   Results of neutron imaging, neutron diffraction, and delayed neutron
   analysis as applied to an examination of sealed capsules containing
   unknown radioactive materials are presented. The results demonstrate
   that neutron-based non-destructive examination techniques can be
   employed for inspecting encapsulated radioactive samples to identify the
   materials, to elucidate the internal physical structure of the
   radioactive material and encapsulation, and to estimate the mass of
   fissile and fissionable materials within. This characterization of
   orphaned radioactive special nuclear material illustrates the potential
   for these techniques in nuclear forensics investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Treosulfan (TREO), originally registered for treatment of ovarian
   cancer, is currently being investigated for conditioning prior to
   hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. TREO is a prodrug, which
   undergoes a pH-and temperature-dependent two-step conversion to active
   monoepoxide {[}S, S-EBDM,
   (2S,3S)-1,2-epoxybutane-3,4-diol-4-methanesulfonate] and diepoxide {[}S,
   S-DEB, (2S, 3S)-1,2: 3,4-diepoxybutane]. In this paper, the kinetics of
   the nonenzymatic transformation of TREO at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C were
   studied for the first time including the effects of the TREO
   concentration, buffer concentration, ionic strength, and the presence of
   NaCl. Transformation of TREO was well described by a kinetic model,
   which included first-order reactions for TREO activation, that is, TREO
   -> S, S-EBDM -> S, S-DEB, and pseudo-first-order reactions for the
   hydrolytic decomposition of S, S-EBDM and S, S-DEB. In contrast to the
   two-step activation of TREO, the hydrolysis of epoxides was influenced
   by electrolytes. In phosphate-buffered saline, decomposition of S,
   S-EBDM and S, S-DEB (mean half-lives 25.7 and 15.4 h) proceeded much
   slower than their formation (mean half-lives 1.5 and 3.5 h). In
   conclusion, the kinetics of the nonenzymatic transformation of TREO in
   the presence of plasma electrolytes cannot contribute to the very low
   levels of S, S-EBDM and S, S-DEB observed in patient plasma. The results
   also indicate that elimination of TREO proceeds primarily via conversion
   to S, S-EBDM. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American

Title = {{Sludge Reduction through Ozonation: Effects of Different Specific

Abstract = {{The activated sludge process constitutes the most widely used wastewater
   treatment. The main drawback of this biological technology, however, is
   the excess sludge produced (ESP). In fact, disposal and management of
   this waste is one of the most expensive management costs at wastewater
   treatment plants (WWTP). Cell lysis based on the lower net biomass
   growth under cryptic conditions is one way to minimize the ESP directly
   in the water line. Ozone is a powerful oxidant used for this purpose.
   This paper reports the long-term data obtained at a full-scale plant
   (50,000 PE) where a fraction of the recycled sludge is treated with a
   low specific ozone dosage and a high treated sludge rate of
   approximately 0.5 kg MLVSSozonated/kgMLVSS(biological)/d. The study
   presents results in terms of ESP reduction and the effect of ozone on
   the main WWTP performance parameters. Specific tests at different
   specific ozone dosages (SOD), ranging between 0.7 and 5 gO(3)/Kg MLVSS,
   were carried out to assess biomass activity changes (AUR, NUR, and PAO
   activity), gravitational behavior, soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD)
   release, and variation in the nonbiodegradable chemical oxygen demand
   (NBCOD) fraction. The main kinetic parameters under study did not change
   above a threshold of SOD of 2 gO(3)/Kg MLVSStreated. Furthermore, a
   comprehensive full-scale analysis determined an overall ESP reduction of
   10\% in terms of dry solids. Finally, an analysis of the energy
   consumption and economic feasibility of this technique is also reported.

Abstract = {{Inflammation induced by cytokines has been linked to increased

   link between these factors with neoplastic process. The mRNA expression
   was measured by real-time PCR, and the DNA damage was analyzed by
   single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). Our data indicated a
   significant increase on inflammatory gene expression in tumor tissues
   compared with normal tissue, and it was also associated with
   undifferentiated grade patients. Moreover, the results showed that the
   higher levels of DNA damage were observed among tumor tissue samples.
   Taken together, the findings presented in this study highlight the

Title = {{Percent Time in Range with Warfarin as a Performance Measure: How Long a
   Sampling Frame Is Needed?}},
Journal = {{JOINT COMMISSION JOURNAL ON QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Warfarin is received by millions of patients in the United
   States and elsewhere and will remain the most commonly used
   anticoagulant for the foreseeable future. Percent time in therapeutic
   range (TTR) with warfarin is increasingly used as a performance measure.
   However, stakeholders have expressed concern that TTR lags behind
   changes in performance. Work in a larger study focused on the impact of
   shortening the conventional measurement period for TTR.
   Methods: Some 124 sites within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
   were examined during a seven-year period (fiscal years {[}FYs] 2008-2014
   (April 1, 2007-September 30, 2014). The duration of time segments (2, 3,
   4, 6 months) used to calculate TTR were varied, and these four durations
   were compared in terms of the number of patients retained per site, mean
   and median site TTR, and site performance rankings.
   Results: Data were obtained on 295,237 unique patients who received
   anticoagulation. As the calculation window shortened, patients with
   better control (that is, higher TTR) were selectively excluded from the
   measurement because their laboratory values were more widely spaced.
   Site mean TTR was highest when the most patients were included (6
   months: 950 patients; TTR 65.2\%) and lowest when the fewest patients
   were included (2 months: 567 patients; TTR 60.0\%). However, the 3-, 4-,
   and 6-month segments achieved similar results, each of which included
   more than 800 patients per site, with mean TTR across a narrow range
   (64.9\%-65.2\%). Site rankings were less highly correlated between the
   2-month period and longer periods (r = 0.70.8) but were otherwise 0.95
   or higher, with a nearly perfect correlation (0.985) between the 4- and
   6-month periods.
   Conclusions: When TTR is used to measure site-level performance,
   comparable results can be achieved using a 4- or a 6-month measurement
   period. On the basis of these results, the use of a 4-month period for
   future measurement efforts is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells are used clinically for various
   therapeutic targets. The location and persistence of engrafted SVF cells
   are important parameters for determining treatment failure versus
   success. We used the GID SVF-1 platform and a clinical protocol to
   harvest and label SVF cells with the fluorinated (F-19) agent CS-1000 as
   part of a first-in-human phase I trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier
   NCT02035085) to track SVF cells with magnetic resonance imaging during
   treatment of radiation-induced fibrosis in breast cancer patients. Flow
   cytometry revealed that SVF cells consisted of 25.0\% 15.8\% CD45+,
   24.6\% +/- 12.5\% CD34+, and 7.5\% +/- 3.3\% CD31+ cells, with 2.1 +/-
   0.7 x 10(5) cells per cubic centimeter of adipose tissue obtained.
   Fluorescent CS-1000 (CS-ATM DM Green) labeled 87.0\% +/- 13.5\% of CD34+
   progenitor cells compared with 47.8\% +/- 18.5\% of hematopoietic CD45+
   cells, with an average of 2.8 +/- 2.0 X 10(12) F-19 atoms per cell,
   determined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The vast
   majority (92.7\% +/- 5.0\%) of CD31+ cells were also labeled, although
   most coexpressed CD34. Only 16\% +/- 22.3\% of CD45-/CD31-/CD34-
   (triple-negative) cells were labeled with CS-ATM DM Green. After
   induction of cell death by either apoptosis or necrosis, >95\% of F-19
   was released from the cells, indicating that fluorine retention can be
   used as a surrogate marker for cell survival. Labeled-SVF cells
   engrafted in a silicone breast phantom could be visualized with a
   clinical 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner at a sensitivity of
   approximately 2 x 10(6) cells at a depth of 5 mm. The current protocol
   can be used to image transplanted SVF cells at clinically relevant cell
   concentrations in patients.}},

Abstract = {{A buildup of material at uranium anodes during uranium electrorefining
   in molten chloride salts has been observed. Potentiodynamic testing has
   been conducted using a three electrode cell, with a uranium working
   electrode in both LiCl/KCl eutectic and LiCl each containing similar to
   5 mol\% UCl3. The anodic current response was observed at 50 degrees
   intervals between 450 degrees C and 650 degrees C in the eutectic salt.
   These tests revealed a buildup of material at the anode in LiCl/KCl
   salt, which was sampled at room temperature, and analyzed using ICP-MS,
   XRD and SEM techniques. Examination of the analytical data, current
   response curves and published phase diagrams has established that as the
   uranium anode dissolves, the U3+ ion concentration in the diffusion
   layer surrounding the electrode rises precipitously to levels, which may
   at low temperatures exceed the solubility limit for UCl3 or in the case
   of the eutectic salt for K2UCl5. The reduction in current response
   observed at low temperature in eutectic salt is eliminated at 650
   degrees C, where K2UCl5 is absent due to its congruent melting and only
   simple concentration polarization effects are seen. In LiCl similar
   concentration effects are seen though significantly longer time at
   applied potential is required to effect a reduction in the current
   response as compared to the eutectic salt. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Begomoviruses comprise an emerging and economically important group of
   plant viruses exclusively transmitted by the sweetpotato whitefly
   Bemisia tabaci in many regions of the world. The past twenty years have
   witnessed significant progress in studying the molecular interactions
   between members of this virus group and B. tabaci. Mechanisms and
   proteins encoded by the insect vector and its bacterial symbionts, which
   have been shown to be important for virus transmission, have been
   identified and thoroughly studied. Despite the economic importance of
   this group of viruses and their impact on the global agriculture,
   progress in investigating the virus-vector interactions is moving slowly
   when compared with similar virus-vector systems in plants and animals.
   Major advances in this field and future perspectives will be discussed
   in this review.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Down-regulation of thyroid hormone receptor beta (THR beta) gene
   has been described in several human malignancies, including thyroid
   cancer. In this study, we analyzed THR beta mRNA expression in surgical
   specimens from a series of human papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs),
   characterized by their genotypic and clinical-biological features.
   Methods Thirty-six PTCs were divided into two groups according to the
   2009 American Thyroid Association risk classification (17 low, 19
   intermediate), and each group was divided into subgroups based on the
   presence or absence of the BRAFV600E mutation (21 BRAF mutated, 15 BRAF
   wild type). Gene expression was analyzed using fluidic cards containing
   probes and primers specific for the THR beta gene, as well as for genes
   of thyroperoxidase (TPO), sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), thyroglobulin
   (Tg) and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSH-R) and for some
   miRNAs involved in thyroid neoplasia and targeting THR beta. The mRNA
   levels of each tumor tissue were compared with their correspondent
   normal counterpart.
   Results THR beta transcript was down-regulated in all PTCs examined. No
   significant differences were found between intermediate-vs low-risk PTCs
   patients, and BRAF-mutated vs BRAF wild-type groups. THR beta expression
   was directly correlated with NIS, TPO, Tg and TSH-R, and inversely
   correlated to miR-21, -146a, -181a and -221 expression.
   Conclusions Our results demonstrate that down-regulation of THR beta is
   a common feature of PTCs. While it is not associated with a more
   aggressive phenotype of PTC, it correlates with the reduction of all the
   markers of differentiation and is associated with overexpression of some
   miRNAs supposed to play a role in thyroid tumorigenesis.}},

Abstract = {{The two carboxylation reactions performed by phosphoenolpyruvate
   carboxylase (PEPC) and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase
   (Rubisco) are vital in the fixation of inorganic carbon for C-4 plants.
   The abundance of PEPC is substantially elevated in C-4 leaves, while the
   location of Rubisco is restricted to one of two chloroplast types. These
   differences compared with C-3 leaves have been shown to result in
   convergent enzyme optimization in some C-4 species. Investigation into
   the kinetic properties of PEPC and Rubisco from Kranz C-4, single cell
   C-4, and C-3 species in Chenopodiaceae s. s. subfamily Suaedoideae
   showed that these major carboxylases in C-4 Suaedoideae species lack the
   same mutations found in other C-4 systems which have been examined; but
   still have similar convergent kinetic properties. Positive selection
   analysis on the N-terminus of PEPC identified residues 364 and 368 to be
   under positive selection with a posterior probability >0.99 using Bayes
   empirical Bayes. Compared with previous analyses on other C-4 species,
   PEPC from C-4 Suaedoideae species have different convergent amino acids
   that result in a higher K-m for PEP and malate tolerance compared with
   C-3 species. Kinetic analysis of Rubisco showed that C-4 species have a
   higher catalytic efficiency of Rubisco (k(catc) in mol CO2 mol(-1)
   Rubisco active sites s(-1)), despite lacking convergent substitutions in
   the rbcL gene. The importance of kinetic changes to the
   two-carboxylation reactions in C-4 leaves related to amino acid
   selection is discussed.}},

   samples over 2 days were assessed. Grandmother caregivers had higher
   stress than noncaregiving grandmothers, but the difference was not
   statistically significant. The two groups did not differ in anxiety,
   depression, and coping. Grandmother caregivers, however, reported
   significantly poorer perceived health than their age cohort (p = .007).
   There was a clear increase from morning to bedtime CRP (p = .02), which
   was more prominent in grandmother caregivers. The cortisol levels for

Journal = {{MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{For successful gene delivery, plasmid DNA must be able to access the
   nucleus in order to be transcribed. Numerous studies have shown that
   gene delivery occurs more readily in dividing cells, which is attributed
   to increased nuclear access when the nuclear envelope disassembles
   during mitosis; however, nonviral carriers continue to have low
   transfection efficiencies and require large quantities of DNA per cell
   to achieve reasonable gene transfer, even in dividing cells. Therefore,
   we hypothesized that using histone-derived nuclear localization
   sequences (NLS)s to target polyplexes might enhance nuclear delivery by
   facilitating interactions with histone effectors that mediate nuclear
   partitioning and retention during mitosis. We discovered a novel
   interaction between polyplexes linked to histone 3 (H3) N-terminal tail
   peptides and the histone nuclear import protein importin-4, as evidenced
   by strong spatial colocalization as well as significantly decreased
   transfection when importin-4 expression was reduced. A fraction of the
   histone-targeted polyplexes was also found to colocalize with the
   retrotranslocon of the endoplasmic reticulum, Sec61. Super resolution
   microscopy demonstrated a high level of polyplex binding to chromatin
   postmitosis, and there also was a significant decrease in the amount of
   chromatin binding following importin-4 knockdown. These results provide
   evidence that natural histone effectors mediate both nuclear entry and
   deposition on chromatin by histone-targeted polyplexes, and a
   translocation event from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol may
   occur before mitosis to enable the polyplexes to interact with these
   essential cytoplasmic proteins.}},

Abstract = {{In clinical settings, when the reproductive history of a near-term bitch
   is limited to mating dates, the possibility to accurately assess whether
   pregnancy is at term could be very useful in order to be able to plan a
   correct management of parturition or to safely perform an elective
   Caesarean section. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic
   efficacy of a single progesterone determination, measured by
   chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), in predicting the occurrence of
   parturition on the following day. At least one blood sample was
   collected from 51 pre-partum bitches during the 3 days before
   parturition and on day of parturition. The efficacy of progesterone as a
   marker of the end of pregnancy was tested using a receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) analysis. Youden's index was calculated to select
   the optimal cut-off value (with 95\% confidence interval), aiming at
   maximizing the correct identification of negative events, so not to risk
   to diagnose as full term a bitch which is not. Progesterone
   concentration lower than 3.4 ng/ml correctly identified the bitches
   whelping the following day; however, because of the obliged prudential
   approach, sensitivity was low (46.88\%), and 17 of 32 full-term bitches
   were missed. Due to a very large individual variation, a single
   progesterone determination has low diagnostic efficacy, although it can
   represent a useful first screening.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of obesity in Chilean children has been increasing
   steadily for the last two decades. The first study to determine
   nutritional status and food intake in a representative sample of this
   population was carried out in 1960. Recently the National Food
   Consumption Survey (ENCA) carried out in 2012 was released by the
   Ministry of Health. However, this study did not include biochemical
   determinations of micronutrients which would allow a better diagnosis of
   nutritional status in children.
   Objective: to review the literature available from 2004 to 2014 in food
   intake and nutritional status in Chilean children aged 4 to 14 years.
   Method: a total of 362 references published between 2004 and 2014 were
   obtained through searches in the databases PubMed, Lilacs, Embase and
   Scielo. From these, 40 articles were selected for a thorough review.
   Results: food intake by children is characterized by a high-energy
   intake, a low consumption of fruits and vegetables and a high
   consumption of bread. The ENCA showed that 95\% of the Chilean
   population has a deficient diet. A high prevalence of obesity is
   observed from very early in life. There is a dearth of data available on
   plasma indicators of vitamin and mineral status since 1960, which would
   provide more reliable information on nutritional assessment.
   Conclusion: It is imperative to implement a representative nutrition
   survey of children in Chile that includes biochemical indicators to get
   reliable information in order to develop strategies aimed to correct
   micronutrient malnutrition from excess or deficiency.}},

Abstract = {{In dermatology, attempts at synergy between man and machine have mainly
   been made to improve melanoma diagnosis. The aim of the present study
   was to test an integrated digital dermoscopy analysis' (i-DDA) system
   with a series of melanocytic lesions that were benign and malignant in
   nature, and to evaluate its discriminating power with respect to
   histological diagnosis. In a retrospective study we used an i-DDA system
   to evaluate a series of 856 excised, clinically atypical pigmented skin
   lesions (584 benign and 272 malignant). The system evaluated 48
   parameters to be studied as possible discriminant variables, grouped
   into four categories (geometries, colours, textures and islands of
   colour) integrated with three personal metadata items (sex, age and site
   of lesion) and presence/absence of three dermoscopic patterns
   (regression structures, blue-white veil and polymorphic vascular
   structures). Stepwise multivariate logistic regression of i-DDA data
   selected nine variables with the highest possible discriminant power. At
   the end of the stepwise procedure the percentage of cases correctly
   classified by i-DDA was 89.2\% (100\% sensitivity and 40.8\%
   specificity). The limitations of the study included those associated
   with a retrospective design and the a priori' exclusion of
   nonmelanocytic skin lesions. By incorporating numerical digital features
   with personal data and some dermoscopic patterns into the learning
   process, the proposed i-DDA improved the performance of assisted
   melanoma diagnosis, with the advantage that our results can be
   objectively repeated in any other clinical setting. Copyright (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Sound transmission loss (STL) tests of acoustic insulation panels are
   commonly performed in large reverberation rooms. Large size rooms are
   required by acoustic standards to ensure that a large number of modes
   can be excited in the frequency range of interest, to create a diffuse
   sound field. However for STL measurements in low frequency range small
   enclosures should be able to provide adequate homogenous sound fields,
   namely `pressure sound fields'. The expected effect of the air sealed in
   an enclosure backing a panel, is to increase the stiffness of the panel
   artificially raising the first natural frequency of the panel, which
   corresponds to a minimum value in the STL spectrum. In this paper the
   influence of the air cavity's added stiffness on the panel STL is
   investigated in detail. As expected the effect of the sealed air is to
   increase the plate stiffness and as a result to increase the frequency
   of its first natural mode, however the effect on the STL in this
   frequency region is unexpectedly insignificant which removes the need
   for correcting STL measurements using small enclosures in low frequency
   range-around their first natural frequency of the panels.}},

Abstract = {{The extensive protein hydrolysate of hard-to-cook bean (Phaseolus

   Bagsvaerd, Denmark) sequential enzymatic system (AFH) was added to durum
   wheat semolina pasta at four concentrations (0\%, 5\%, 10\% and 15\%).
   The pastas were obtained using a Brabender 10 DN monoscrew extruder
   (Brabender GmbH \& Co. KC, Duisburg, Germany), and extrusion conditions
   were 30C, 34\% moisture content and 100 rpm screw speed. Addition of a
   hard-to-cook bean hydrolysate to semolina pasta produced improved
   changes in physical properties. Cooking time and diameter decreased, but
   weight loss increased as alcalase/flavourzyme hydolysate (AFH) inclusion
   levels increased. The addition of AFH did not affect pasta water
   sorption. The available starch/resistant starch ratio (3: 5) was the
   same in both pastas (10\% AFH and control). The 10\% AFH treatment
   retained an adequate insoluble/soluble dietary fiber ratio. For this,
   consumption of the 10\% AFH pasta could reduce caloric intake
   (approximately 6.5\%) and increase the nutritional contribution of
   fiber, making this product a functional food.}},

Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},

Pages = {{3871-3880}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Popular part-based approaches to recognition are currently limited to
   few localized parts, which only poorly represent the fine-scale details
   and large variability of object categories. Extending to hundreds of
   specific part detectors helps to capture peculiar characteristics but
   due to their specificity, for each object instance different parts will
   be helpful and others will yield noisy responses that actually impair
   classification. While training the part-based model, we thus need to
   learn which parts are relevant for which training instances. To
   automatically discover these latent topics of parts and instances we
   employ generative non-negative matrix factorization and seek topics with
   low reconstruction error. To assure recognition performance this
   generative approach is embedded within a discriminative latent
   max-margin procedure that separates classes while optimizing the latent
   topics. Consequently, generative reconstruction is regularizing
   discriminative classification, while the latter ensures that topics
   actually help in recognition. Experiments on PASCAL VOC demonstrate the
   recognition performance of our model as well as the construction of
   meaningful topics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling solar radiation in street canyons is crucial to understanding
   the solar availability of building facades. This article describes the
   implementation of a simulation routine, developed in the Matlab((R))
   computer language, which is aimed at predicting solar access for
   building facades located in dense urban conglomerates comprising deep
   long street canyons, under high solar radiation conditions, typical in
   southern countries of Europe. Methodology is primarily based on the
   configuration factor theory, also aided by computer simulation, which
   enables to assess the interplay between the surfaces that compose the
   so-called street canyon. The results of the theoretical model have been
   cross-checked and verified by on-site measurements in two real case
   studies, two streets in Cadiz and Seville. The simplified simulation
   reproduces the shape of the curve for on-site measured values and
   weighted errors for the whole model do not surpass 10\%, with a maximum
   of 9.32\% and a mean values of 6.31\%. As a result, a simplified
   predictive model that takes into account direct, diffuse and reflected
   solar radiation from the surfaces that enclose the canyon, has been
   devised. The authors consider that this research provides further
   improvement, as well as a handy alternative approach, to usual methods
   used for the calculation of available solar radiation in urban canyons,
   such as the Sky View Factor or the ray tracing.}},

Title = {{Eating to live or living to eat? Exploring the causal attributions of

Abstract = {{Previous studies indicate that many people perceive themselves to be
   addicted to food. However, little is known about how the concept of
   `food addiction' is defined amongst members of the lay public. The
   current study examined beliefs about the cognitive and behavioural
   manifestations of food addiction. Participants (N = 210) completed an
   intemet-delivered questionnaire in which they indicated whether or not
   they perceived themselves to be a food addict and provided a brief
   explanation for their response. Over a quarter of participants (28\%)
   perceived themselves to be food addicts and self-diagnosis was predicted
   by increased BMI and younger age, but not by gender. Thematic analysis
   was conducted to explore the causal attributions provided by
   self-perceived food addicts and non-addicts. Six characteristics were
   identified: 1) Reward-driven eating (i.e. eating for psychological
   rather than physiological reasons), 2) A functional or psychological
   preoccupation with food, 3) A perceived lack of self-control around
   food, 4) Frequent food cravings, 5) Increased weight or an unhealthy
   diet, and 6) A problem with a specific type of food. The emergent
   themes, and their frequency, did not differ between self-perceived food
   addicts and non-addicts. However, self-perceived food addicts and
   non-addicts reported divergent cognitions, behaviours and attitudes
   within each common theme. This study is the first to provide qualitative
   insight into beliefs about food addiction in both self-perceived food
   addicts and non-addicts. The findings appear to reflect a view of food
   addiction that is identifiable through several core behaviours. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Objectives: This is a preliminary, single-center, prospective study in
   the field of autologous cord blood transplant. We investigated the
   feasibility, safety, and tolerability of autologous whole cord blood
   transplant in extremely premature infants as a potential therapeutic
   modality to prevent developing complications related to prematurity.
   Materials and Methods: This preliminary prospective study
   (ClinicalTrials. gov identifier NCT02050971) included preterm infants
   born at less than 32 weeks of gestational age who developed anemia
   because of prematurity. Infants were assigned to 2 groups: (1) those
   receiving an autologous cord blood transfusion within 5 days postpartum
   (n = 5) and (2) those who obtained only an allogeneic red blood cell
   transfusion when necessary (n = 9; control group). Vital measurements
   were performed during and after transfusion, and peripheral blood pH,
   hematocrit, glucose, and calcium and potassium ion levels were measured
   over the next 4 days.
   Results: Oxygen saturation was significantly increased throughout the
   cord blood transfusion and in the subsequent 48 hours. No significant
   differences were found in vital measurements, such as arterial blood
   pressure (mean, systolic, and diastolic) or heart rate over the first 48
   hours posttransfusion. Similarly, no significant differences were found
   in biochemical analyses of blood with the exception of pH level. We
   found initial pH level to be significantly augmented in the cord blood
   recipient group by the first day after transplant, which remained
   significantly higher for next 24 hours compared with that shown in the
   control group.
   Conclusions: Collection, preparation, and short-term storage of unfrozen
   cord blood are feasible for clinical use. Our results showed general
   safety and tolerability of the procedure of whole autologous cord blood
   transplant in recruited preterm newborns. However, because our study
   group was small, these results need to be confirmed in further
   investigations with a larger patient cohort.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolic disease risk is influenced by genetics and modifiable factors,
   such as physical activity and diet. Beginning at 6 weeks of age, rats
   selectively bred for high (HVR) versus low voluntary running distance
   (LVR) behaviors were housed in a complex design with or without
   voluntary running wheels being fed either a standard or Western (WD,
   42\% kcal from fat and added sucrose) diet for 8 weeks. Upon
   intervention completion, percent body fat, leptin, insulin, and
   mediobasal hypothalamic mRNAs related to appetite control were assessed.
   Wheel access led to differences in body weight, food intake, and serum
   leptin and insulin. Intriguingly, percent body fat, leptin, and insulin
   did not differ between HVR and LVR lines in response to the two levels
   of voluntary running, regardless of diet, after the 8 wk. experiment
   despite HVR eating more calories than LVR regardless of diet and
   voluntarily running 5-7 times further in wheels than LVR. In response to
   WD, we observed increases in Cart and Lepr mediobasal hypothalamic mRNA
   in HVR, but no differences in LVR. Npy mRNA was intrinsically greater in
   LVR than HVR, while wheel access led to greater Pomc and Cart mRNA in
   LVR versus HVR. These data suggest that despite greater consumption of
   WD, HVR animals respond similarly to WD as LVR as a result, in part, of
   their increased wheel running behavior. Furthermore, high physical
   activity in HVR may offset the deleterious effects of a WD on adiposity
   despite greater energy intake in this group. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

   Contracts: a Critical Evaluation of the European Legislature's Recent

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSUMER POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{431-456}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In May 2013, the European legislature enacted two measures relating to
   Alternative Dispute Resolution in consumer matters: the Directive on
   Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR-Directive) and the Regulation on
   Online Dispute Resolution (ODR-Regulation). Both measures are intended
   to support the out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes with a view
   to ensure that consumers have straight-forward and low-cost access to
   justice. This article analyses whether and to what extent the
   ADR-Directive and the ODR-Regulation manage to achieve this aim in the
   field of cross-border consumer contracts. It sheds light on the European
   legislature's competence to regulate ADR, analyses the potential
   benefits of cross-border ADR, details the specific problems of
   cross-border ADR, and determines whether and to what extent the
   ADR-Directive and the ODR-Regulation resolve these problems. The article
   concludes that the ADR-Directive and the ODR-Regulation-while providing
   relief for some of the problems associated with cross-border ADR fail to
   resolve the two core problems of competence and language. Accordingly,
   it is unlikely that the ADR-Directive and the ODR-Regulation will
   significantly promote cross-border ADR and enhance cross-border consumer
   access to justice.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a primary
   immunodeficiency characterized by chronic lymphoproliferation,
   autoimmune manifestations, expansion of double-negative T-cells, and
   susceptibility to malignancies. Most cases of ALPS are caused by
   germline or somatic FAS mutations. We report the case of an ALPS patient
   due to a novel homozygous Fasligand gene mutation (ALPS-FASLG).
   METHODS: ALPS biomarkers were measured and FASLG mutation was
   identified. Functional characterization was carried out based on
   activation-induced cell death (AICD) and cytotoxicity assays.
   RESULTS: This report describes the cases of a patient who presented a
   severe form of ALPS-FASLG, and his brother who had died due to
   complications related to ALPS. Moreover, in another family, we present
   the first case of lymphoma in a patient with ALPS-FASLG. Functional
   studies showed defective Fasligand-mediated apoptosis, cytotoxicity, and
   AICD in T-cell blasts. Otherwise, expression of the FASLG gene and
   corresponding protein was normal, but the shedding of the Fasligand was
   impaired in T-cells. Additionally, analyzing Epstein-Barr virus
   (EBV)-transformed B-cells, our results indicate impaired AICD in
   ALPS-FASLG patients.
   CONCLUSION: Patients with autosomal recessive inheritance of ALPS-FASLG
   have a severe phenotype and a partial defect in AICD in T- and B-cell
   lines. The Fasligand could play a key role in immune surveillance
   preventing malignancy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper derives conditions under which a stable solution to the
   least-squares linear estimation problem for multifractional random
   fields can be obtained. The observation model is defined in terms of a
   multifractional pseudodifferential equation. The weak-sense and
   strong-sense formulations of this problem are studied through the theory
   of fractional Sobolev spaces of variable order, and the spectral theory
   of multifractional pseudodifferential operators and their parametrix.
   The Theory of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces is also applied to
   define a stable solution to the direct and inverse estimation problems.
   Numerical projection methods are proposed based on the construction of
   orthogonal bases of these spaces. Indeed, projection into such bases
   leads to a regularization, removing the ill-posed nature of the
   estimation problem. A simulation study is developed to illustrate the
   estimation results derived. Some open research lines in relation to the
   extension of the derived results to the multifractal process context are
   also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in illness
   perception and overall impact on fibromyalgia females from Spain and the
   Netherlands. A total of 325 fibromyalgia females from Spain (54.3 +/-
   7.1 years) and the Netherlands (51.8 +/- 7.2 years) participated in the
   study. Illness perception and impact of fibromyalgia were assessed by
   the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire and the Fibromyalgia Impact
   Questionnaire, respectively. Spanish fibromyalgia females perceived more
   symptoms related to their fibromyalgia (identity) such as nausea,
   breathlessness, wheezing or fatigue (P < 0.001) and had greater
   emotional representation (P < 0.01). Dutch fibromyalgia females
   experienced less timeline (acute/chronic) and consequences (all, P <
   0.05), had a better cyclical timeline, personal control, treatment
   control and illness coherence (all, P < 0.001). Spanish fibromyalgia
   females reported higher impact of fibromyalgia than Dutch females (61.2
   + 14.8 vs. 54.9 + 16.4, respectively; P < 0.001), but the effect size
   was small (Cohen's d = 0.41) . Impact of fibromyalgia and negative views
   of fibromyalgia were higher in Spanish fibromyalgia females, whereas
   Dutch fibromyalgia females presented higher score of positive beliefs
   about the controllability of the illness. Psychological interventions
   which help patients to cope with their illness perception might lead to
   an improvement of the impact of the disease on fibromyalgia females.}},

Abstract = {{Protein kinases are important mediators of intracellular signaling and
   are reversibly activated by phosphorylation. Immobilized kinase
   inhibitors can be used to enrich these often low-abundance proteins, to
   identify targets of kinase inhibitors, or to probe their selectivity. It
   has been suggested that the binding of kinases to affinity beads
   reflects a kinase's activation status, a concept that is under
   considerable debate. To assess the merits of the idea, we performed a
   series of experiments including quantitative phosphoproteomics and
   purification of kinases by single or mixed affinity matrices from
   signaling activated or resting cancer cells. The data show that mixed
   affinity beads largely bind kinases independent a their activation
   status, and experiments using individual immobilized kinase inhibitors
   show mixed results in terms of preference for binding the active or
   inactive conformation. Taken together, activity- or
   conformation-dependent binding to such affinity resins depends (i) on
   the kinase, (ii) on the affinity probe, and (iii) on the activation
   status of the lysate or cell. As a result, great caution should be
   exercised when inferring kinase activity from such binding data. The
   results also suggest that assaying kinase activity using binding data is
   restricted to a limited number of well-chosen cases.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The goal of this project was to use the Consolidated
   Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as the theoretical
   foundation for developing a web-based clinical decision support system
   (CDSS) for primary care screening and care coordination by dental
   hygienists at chairside.
   Methods: First, we appraised New York State education and scope of
   practice requirements for dental hygienists with input from health
   experts who constituted a Senior Advisory Board for the project, and
   reviewed current professional guidelines and best practices for tobacco
   use, hypertension and diabetes screening, and nutrition counseling at
   chairside. Second, we created algorithms for these four health issues
   (tobacco, hypertension, diabetes, and nutrition) using evidence-based
   guidelines endorsed by authoritative professional bodies. Third, an
   information technology specialist incorporated the algorithms into a
   tool using an iterative process to refine the CDSS, with input from
   dental hygienists, dentists, Senior Advisory Board members and research
   staff.
   Results: An evidence-based CDSS for use by dental hygienists at
   chairside for tobacco use, hypertension and diabetes screening, and
   nutrition counseling was developed with the active participation of the
   individuals involved in the implementation process.
   Conclusions: CDSS technology may potentially be leveraged to enhance
   primary care screening and coordination by dental hygienists at
   chairside, leading to improved patient care. Using the CFIR as a
   pragmatic structure for implementing this intervention across multiple
   settings, the developed CDSS is available for downloading and adaptation
   to diverse dental settings and other primary care sensitive conditions.}},

   hydrogen bonding patterns: a single isolated dimer and much more common
   a double acceptor bifurcated complex. O-H center dot center dot center
   dot ON hydrogen bonds of energies 10-20 kcal/mol, in contrast to weaker
   N-H center dot center dot center dot ON (about S kcal/mol) ones, are
   more favored in the crystal state. The experimental evidence of proton
   transfer is found only for homonudear O-H center dot center dot center
   dot ON N-oxide hydrogen bridges. Hirshfeld surface fingerprint plots
   reveal areas useful for distinguishing N-oxide hydrogen bonds from other

   demonstrated that formation of hydrogen bonds significantly influence
   the NO bond length and its properties including pi delocalization.}},

Abstract = {{We report a dc-coupled burst-mode (BM) receiver for optical links in a
   dynamically reconfigurable network. Through the introduction of
   interlocking search algorithms, a robust 25 Gb/s BM operation is

   receiver first performs input dc current offset calibration in 12.5 ns,
   then achieves phase lock in 18.5 ns, and after that tracks data using a
   phase interpolator (PI) based bang-bang clock and data recovery (CDR).
   The sensitivity of the receiver is -10.9 dBm (average power, BER <
   10(-12)) at 25 Gb/s, tested with a single mode 1550 nm reference optical
   transmitter. There is no significant sensitivity penalty in the presence
   of +/-100 ppm frequency offset between the transmitter and the receiver.
   Measured power efficiency of the receiver at 25 Gb/s is 4.4 pJ/bit. The

Abstract = {{Background: An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the current method
   used for screening and diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
   OGTT is a relatively complicated procedure and is expensive. Thus, new
   strategies that do not require fasting or more than a single blood draw
   may improve the diagnosis of GDM and increase the rate of GDM testing.
   We investigated the utility of monitoring glycosylated hemoglobin
   (HbA1c) levels for the diagnosis of GDM.
   Methods: The data from 992 pregnant women with estimated gestational
   ages ranging from 24 to 28 weeks were retrospectively reviewed. There
   were 367 women with plasma glucose levels >= 140 mg/dL 1 hour after a
   50-g OGTT. GDM was diagnosed according to the Carpenter-Coustan criteria
   for a 3-hour 100 g OGTT. A HbA1c assessment was performed at the same
   time.
   Results: We enrolled 343 women in this study, and there were 109 women
   with GDM. The area under the curve the receiver operating characteristic
   curve for HbA1c detection of GDM was 0.852 (95\% confidence interval,
   0.808 to 0.897). A HbA1c cutoff value >= 5.35\% had maximal points on
   the Youden index (0.581). The sensitivity was 87.2\% and the specificity
   was 70.9\% for diagnosing GDM. A threshold value >= 5.35\% indicated
   that 163 patients had GDM and that 68 (41.7\%) were false positive. The
   positive predictive value was 58.3\% at this threshold value.
   Conclusion: Despite substantial progress in methodology, HbA1c values
   cannot replace OGTT for the diagnosis of GDM.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The purpose is to describe the method, safety and efficacy
   of transperineal gold seed placement for image-guided radiation therapy.
   Methods: An ethics committee approved database was used to review
   records of consecutive patients from October 2008 through December 2013,
   who underwent transperineal implantation of three gold markers into the
   prostate using staged local anaesthesia and transrectal ultrasound.
   Seeds were counted on radiographs from CT simulation, first treatment
   and last treatment. Retention and use of at least three markers for
   kV/kV matching was considered a successful implant. A visual analogue
   scale (VAS) pain assessment was performed. SAS was used for data
   analysis. Results: Fiducial marker placement was successful for kV/kV
   matching in 556/581 patients (95.7\%). The procedure was aborted due to
   pain in two patients. Additional sedation during the procedure was
   required in two patients. Complications include urinary infections (2
   patients, <0.5\%) and transient haematuria (2 patients, <0.5\%). There
   were no recorded calls requesting additional pain medication or delays
   in radiation due to complications. The number of seeds identified at
   simulation: 4 (2 patients), 3 (554 patients), 2 (21 patients), 1 (1
   patient), 0 (1 patient). One patient with three seeds and two patients
   with <2 seeds had cone beam CT instead of kV/kV imaging for image
   guidance. No seeds were lost after simulation. The mean visual analogue
   pain score associated with transperineal gold seed insertion met
   patients' expectations (respectively 4.1 vs. 4.4 P = 0.19). Conclusion:
   Outpatient transperineal insertion of fiducials avoids the rectum, is
   effective, convenient, well tolerated and has few side effects.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, information entropies have been calculated for
   oxygen allotropes, known from experimental and theoretical studies.
   According to the calculations, only three allotropes (O-2, O-3 (D-3h),
   and O-8 (D-4h)) have zero information entropies. In terms of the Shannon
   approach, it indicates high possibility of their formation. Indeed, O-2
   is a long-time known compound whereas O-8 (D-4h) cluster is a structural
   block of the epsilon-phase of solid oxygen, which has been
   experimentally studied with X-ray diffraction. The closed form of ozone,
   the third zero-entropy structure, has not been synthesized at the moment
   and accompanied with debates around its existence. It has zero
   information entropy as two other obtained allotropes, so the information
   approach provides an additional argument in favor of its achievability.
   A way to increase its stability via encapsulation into molecular cages
   is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background/objectives: Orf is not an endemic disease. However, it causes
   epidemics after the Feast of the Sacrifice in Muslim countries because
   it is transmitted from animals. This study investigates orf disease
   incidences during and after the Feast of the Sacrifice period in Izmir.
   The study seeks to detect the association between various occupations
   and orf, as well as the rate of disease-related complications.
   Methods: This retrospective study included 168 orf patients and 352
   control patients selected from among 68,723 patients who applied to our
   dermatology polyclinic between 2006 and 2012. The patients were grouped
   according to their occupation, residential area, and the time at which
   they acquired the disease (either before or after the Feast of the
   Sacrifice).
   Results: Orf disease was detected most commonly in butchers (24.4\%)
   before the Feast of the Sacrifice and in slaughterers (40.5\%) after the
   Feast of the Sacrifice. When the sum of all groups was inspected, the
   group most exposed to the disease was the group that fed and slaughtered
   the animals (45.2\%). A male preponderance (30.4\%) was found in this
   group before the Feast of the Sacrifice, whereas a female preponderance
   (32.7\%) was found in this group after the Feast.
   Conclusion: The high rate of orf detected (168/68,723) in our research
   is connected with an increase of population, sacrifices, and animal
   husbandry regions. Copyright (C) 2015, Taiwanese Dermatological

Abstract = {{Despite the fact that the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) plays a
   pivotal role in emotional memory processing in different regions of the
   brain, its function in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) remains unknown.
   Here, using contextual fear conditioning in rats, we showed that a
   post-training intra-RSC infusion of the CB1R antagonist AM251 impaired,
   and the agonist CP55940 improved, long-term memory consolidation.
   Additionally, a post-reactivation infusion of AM251 enhanced memory
   reconsolidation, while CP55940 had the opposite effect. Finally, AM251
   blocked extinction, whereas CP55940 facilitated it and maintained memory
   extinguished over time. Altogether, our data strongly suggest that the
   cannabinoid system of the RSC modulates emotional memory.}},

Abstract = {{We present an experimental investigation of different Kerr nonlinearity
   mitigation schemes in a 2-span dispersion-compensated link of 160-km
   length for 4 x 28-GBd single-polarization 16-QAM signal transmission. We
   consider optical phase conjugation (OPC) based on mid-link spectral
   inversion, digital backpropagation (DBP), and transmission of
   phase-conjugated twin-waves with either digital coherent superposition
   (DCS) or all-optical coherent superposition employing phase-sensitive
   amplification (PSA). The experiments are performed in a single-channel
   and a wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) scenario. For
   single-channel operation, phase-conjugated twin waves with DCS provided
   superior performance compared to all the other mitigation schemes with a
   maximum Q(2)-factor improvement of 1.7 dB compared to signal
   transmission without any nonlinearity mitigation. The DBP, however,
   showed a higher nonlinear threshold than all the other schemes in our
   experiments. In the WDM scenario, DBP showed worse performance than the
   other mitigation schemes whereas the DCS again provided a higher
   Q(2)-factor improvement than the other techniques with a maximum
   Q(2)-factor improvement of 1.9 dB. The PSA and the mid-link OPC showed
   similar nonlinearity mitigation performance both in single-channel and
   WDM scenarios.}},

Title = {{Trends in acute myocardial infarction hospitalizations: Are we seeing

Journal = {{AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{170}},

Abstract = {{Background Payers and policy makers rely on studies of trends in acute
   myocardial infarction (AMI) hospitalizations and spending that count
   only hospitalizations where the AMI is the principal discharge
   diagnosis. Hospitalizations with AMI coded as a secondary diagnosis are
   ignored. The effects of excluding these hospitalizations on estimates of
   trends are unknown.
   Methods Observational study of all AMI hospitalizations in
   Fee-for-Service Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older, from 2002
   through 2011.
   Results We studied 3,663,137 hospitalizations with any AMI discharge
   diagnosis over 288,873,509 beneficiary-years. Of these, 66\% had AMI
   coded as principal (versus secondary). From 2002 to 2011, AMI
   hospitalization rates declined 24.5\% (from 1,485 per 100,000
   beneficiary-years in 2002 to 1,122 in 2011). Meanwhile, the proportion
   of these hospitalizations with a secondary AMI diagnosis increased from
   28\% to 40\%; by 2011 these secondary AMI hospitalizations accounted for
   43\% of all expenditures for hospitalizations with AMI, or \$2.8
   billion. Major changes in comorbidities, principal diagnoses and mean
   costs for hospitalizations with a non-principal AMI diagnosis occurred
   in the 2006-2008 timeframe.
   Conclusions Current estimates of the burden of AMI ignore an
   increasingly large proportion of overall AMI hospitalizations and
   spending. Changes in the characteristics of hospitalizations that
   coincided with major payment and policy changes suggest that
   non-clinical factors affect AMI coding. Failing to consider all AMIs
   could inflate estimates of population health improvements, overestimate
   the value of AMI prevention and treatment and underestimate current and
   future AMI burden and expenditures.}},

Abstract = {{Iran is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. In
   recent earthquakes, the low quality of constructions has caused huge
   losses, both in human and economic terms. The high level of seismic
   hazard in combination with a high physical vulnerability of structures
   leads to a high earthquake risk of Iran, which has to be managed in some
   ways. Earthquake happening in populated areas causing economic and human
   losses has shown the vital role of assessing buildings' vulnerabilities
   as well as loss estimations. Vulnerability curve is one of the essential
   instruments to evaluate structural losses before the events. Regarding
   the lack of categorized vulnerability curves for Iranian buildings, this
   study focuses on filling this critical gap. For this reason, empirical
   approach involving statistical processing on existing data from the
   previous studies is used to develop vulnerability curves for Iranian
   buildings by critiquing the existing fragility/ vulnerability curves in
   Iran and other countries. The logic-tree method is used to combine these
   curves by weighting in accordance with the condition of construction
   provisions, seismic code and engineering judgment. Finally,
   vulnerability curves are developed for the 42 Iranian building types.
   Results are presented by median (Sa) and lognormal standard deviation
   (bSa) values for all types of selected buildings and related
   uncertainties are considered as well.}},

Abstract = {{Green sulfur photosynthetic bacteria Chlorobaculum (Cba.) tepidum and
   Cba. limnaeum were cultivated with the supplementation of 9-decyn-1-ol,
   9-decen-1-ol, and decan-1-ol by two methods to biosynthesize unnatural
   chlorosomal bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) pigments possessing an
   (un)saturated bond at the terminus of the esterifying chain. The
   supplementation of the acetone solutions of the exogenous alcohols every
   24 h to Cba. tepidum (denoted as Method A) successfully produced
   unnatural BChls c esterified with the alcohols in vivo. The ratios of
   unnatural BChls c esterified with 9-decyn-1-ol, 9-decen-1-ol, and
   decan-1-ol over the total BChls c in Cba. tepidum were not so different
   from each other, indicating that terminal unsaturated moieties in the
   exogenous alcohols barely affected the last reaction in the BChl c
   biosynthesis catalyzed by the BChl c synthase. Cba. tepidum grown in a
   liquid culture that initially contained 9-decyn-1-ol and 9-decen-1-ol
   (denoted as Method B) also accumulated BChls c esterified with these
   alcohols; the relative ratios of the unnatural BChls c were analogous to
   those obtained by Method A at the corresponding final concentrations. In
   contrast, Cba. limnaeum did not synthesize BChl e esterified with the
   three exogenous alcohols. The incorporation of unsaturated bonds into
   the esterifying moieties of BChl c by a biosynthetic reaction will be
   useful as structural probes for the investigation of pigment
   interactions and the biogenesis of chlorosomes as well as the scaffolds
   for bioorthogonal modifications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The use of 2D finite element CFD model and the common film model (FM)
   for analysis of FO performance data was examined to assess the merits of
   conclusions derived from the above approaches regarding characterization
   of membrane and support layer resistances to water and salt permeation.
   The FM model leads to estimation of porous layer resistivity (K) that
   implies tortuosity/porosity ratio that is significantly higher than is
   physically attainable for typical membrane porous supports. Comparative
   FO data analysis with the 2D CFD model and FM approximation reveals that
   the latter approach overestimates (by an order of magnitude and greater)
   the significance of the permeation resistance of the FO membrane support
   layer. It is also shown that membrane (water and solute) permeabilities
   extracted from FO operation in the RO mode (FO/RO) are significantly
   higher than obtained from direct analysis of FO performance data via
   detailed 2D CFD modeling. The present analysis suggests that
   improvements in FO water permeability are more likely to emerge from
   developing higher permeability membrane skin and improved channel
   hydrodynamics (to decrease external concentration polarization) rather
   than from more permeable and thinner membrane support layer as has been
   asserted in various studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Primary laryngeal aspergillosis is extremely rare, especially in an

   because of its rarity. The present case is a 28-year-old asthmatic
   female who was on inhalational steroid for 8 years, presented with
   sudden onset of severe dysphonia for 5 days. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy
   demonstrated whitish plaque involving right vocal cord, clinically
   suggestive of fungal laryngitis. Microlaryngeal laser surgery was
   performed with stripping of the plaque. Histopathology demonstrated
   ulcerated hyperplastic squamous epithelium with masses of fungal hyphae,
   which was confirmed to be Aspergillus species on fungal culture. This
   rare but serious adverse effect of long-term steroid MDI use must be
   kept in mind while treating an asthmatic patient. We also present a

Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{540-547}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Urban marginal land can be used for growing high yield bioenergy crops
   such as miscanthus and poplar. Here, a GIS-based modeling framework was
   created to assess potential urban marginal lands in Boston that include
   vacant lands and under-utilized public and private areas with adequate
   soil quality and sunlight. Using ArcGIS model builder as a spatial
   analysis tool, land parcels were screened for typical urban features
   such as buildings, driveways, parking lots, water and protected areas.
   The resultant layer was subjected to bio-geophysical modeling that
   includes soil quality, slope analysis and finally shadow analysis.
   Approximately 2660 ha of potential marginal land was identified as
   suitable, representing 24\% of total land area in Boston. Using crop
   yield information, it was estimated that this marginal land could be
   used to produce up to a total of nearly 42,130 tons of high yield short
   rotation poplar biomass in a regular growing season. Also, bioenergy
   potential calculation revealed that for short rotation poplar, this
   amount of biomass can potentially yield up to 745 TJ (LHV) to 830 (HHV)
   TJ of yearly primary energy for the city of Boston that can be used for
   heat or electricity production, particularly for microgrid or district
   heating applications. This is equivalent to similar to 0.6\% of
   Massachusetts primary energy demand for 2012. Ongoing work will explore
   other urban regions of Massachusetts and the Eastern US that might be
   able to fulfill part of their energy demand locally while providing
   benefits in environmental quality, economic development, and urban
   resilience. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Azilsartan, but not Candesartan Improves Left Ventricular Diastolic
   Function in Patients with Hypertension and Heart Failure}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERONTOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{201-205}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Diastolic dysfunction is a major cause of heart failure (HF)
   with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF); however, there is no clear
   strategy for treating diastolic dysfunction. Myocardial and vascular
   abnormalities may cause HFpEF, which indicates that correcting both
   abnormalities may specifically improve the severity of diastolic
   dysfunction. Candesartan primarily affects the myocardium, but
   azilsartan affects the myocardium and the aortic vasculature. This study
   was undertaken to test the hypothesis that azilsartan, but not
   candesartan, improves left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction in
   patients with hypertension and HFpEF.
   Methods: Among patients with HF in our database, the patients who
   received azilsartan or candesartan were retrospectively screened.
   Fifteen patients treated with azilsartan were identified, and
   sex-matched patients who received candesartan were blindly selected.
   Results: At baseline, there were no significant differences between the
   two groups in clinical findings, echocardiographic parameters, and
   plasma brain natriuretic peptide levels. At 3-6 months, blood pressure
   decreased to similar levels in both groups. However, the early LV
   filling velocity/early diastolic velocity (E/e') ratio decreased in the
   azilsartan group (13.0 +/- 4.2 vs. 10.9 +/- 3.2, p = 0.03), but remained
   unchanged in the candesartan group (12.0 +/- 3.6 vs. 12.5 +/- 5.0, p =
   0.58; for interaction, p = 0.04). Other echocardiographic parameters
   were unaltered by azilsartan or candesartan.
   Conclusion: Azilsartan improves diastolic function in HF patients with
   hypertension, and it may be the preferred option over other angiotensin
   II receptor blockers in patients with HFpEF. Copyright (C) 2015, Taiwan

Title = {{Deer overbrowsing on autumn-flowering plants causes bumblebee decline
   and impairs pollination service}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Increased ungulate browsing has altered the composition of plant
   communities and food webs of forest ecosystems in many regions around
   the world. To evaluate the cascading impact of deer browsing on
   pollination and plant reproduction is critical to understand the roles
   of species interactions in maintaining plant populations and for
   conservation management. In this study, we investigated the
   relationships among floral resources of understory herbaceous plants,
   pollinator visitation, and fruit set of shrub species based on data
   accumulation over three years in six temperate deciduous forests with
   deer and without deer. We found that in deer browsed sites, the
   visitation rate of bumblebees had decreased due to severe reduction in
   the coverage of autumn-flowering herbaceous plants, while the effect
   varied between bumblebee species. On the other hand, other insect taxa
   showed no dependence on variation in autumn floral resources. The two
   genera of bumblebee-pollinated shrubs showed reduced fruit set due to
   severe decline in autumn-flowering herbaceous plants and bumblebee
   visitation (Weigela: -18.5\% and Rhododendron: -21.9\%). In contrast,
   the fruit set of shrubs pollinated by insects that did not show
   dependence on autumn floral resources were not negatively affected by
   deer browsing. Our results suggest that deer browsing have not only
   caused negative effects on herbaceous plants, but in addition have
   negative indirect effects on reproduction of woody plants through
   cascading effects of pollination linkages.}},

Abstract = {{Porins can act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, can be
   recognized by the host immune system and modulate immune responses.
   Vibrio choleraeporin OmpU aids in bacterial survival in the human gut by
   increasing resistance against bile acids and anti-microbial peptides. V.
   choleraeOmpU is pro-inflammatory in nature. However, interestingly, it
   can also down-regulate LPS-mediated pro-inflammatory responses. In this
   study, we have explored how OmpU-pretreatment affects LPS-mediated
   responses. Our study indicates that OmpU-pretreatment followed by
   LPS-activation does not induce M2-polarization of macrophages/monocytes.
   Further, OmpU attenuates LPS-mediated TLR2/TLR6 signaling by decreasing
   the association of TLRs along with recruitment of MyD88 and IRAKs to the
   receptor complex. This results in decreased translocation of NF kappa B
   in the nucleus. Additionally, OmpU-pretreatment up-regulates expression
   of IRAK-M, a negative regulator of TLR signaling, in RAW 264.7 mouse
   macrophage cells upon LPS-stimulation. Suppressor cytokine IL-10 is
   partially involved in OmpU-induced down-regulation of LPS-mediated TNF
   alpha production in human PBMCs. Furthermore, OmpU-pretreatment also
   affects macrophage function, by enhancing phagocytosis in LPS-treated
   RAW 264.7 cells, and down-regulates LPS-induced cell surface expression
   of co-stimulatory molecules. Altogether, OmpU causes suppression of
   LPS-mediated responses by attenuating the LPS-mediated TLR signaling
   pathway. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Ant colony optimization (ACO) has been successfully applied to
   classification, where the aim is to build a model that captures the
   relationships between the input attributes and the target class in a
   given domain's dataset. The constructed classification model can then be
   used to predict the unknown class of a new pattern. While artificial
   neural networks are one of the most widely used models for pattern
   classification, their application is commonly restricted to fully
   connected three-layer topologies. In this paper, we present a new
   algorithm, ANN-Miner, which uses ACO to learn the structure of
   feed-forward neural networks. We report computational results on 40
   benchmark datasets for several variations of the algorithm. Performance
   is compared to the standard three-layer structure trained with two
   different weight-learning algorithms (back propagation, and the
   algorithm), and also to a greedy algorithm for learning NN structures. A
   nonparametric Friedman test is used to determine statistical
   significance. In addition, we compare our proposed algorithm with NEAT,
   a prominent evolutionary algorithm for evolving neural networks, as well
   as three different well-known state-of-the-art classifiers, namely the
   C4.5 decision tree induction algorithm, the Ripper classification rule

Abstract = {{Using numerical simulations of the mixed common sardine and anchovy
   fishery of central-southern Chile, this article studies the effects of
   the distribution of administrative costs between the government and the
   fishing industry in an individual transferable quota system. Consistent
   with recent theoretical results, the analysis indicates that the
   presence and distribution of the administrative costs can have important
   impacts on the performance of an individual transferable quota system.
   The numerical simulations reveal significant and non-monotonic effects
   on the optimal paths of transferable quotas, biomass, quota price, size
   of the active fishing fleet, and the value of the fishery. While the
   effects of the distribution of administrative costs are complicated in
   the case study under analysis, the results suggest that it is likely
   optimal for the industry and government to share the administrative
   costs in this fishery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to superior accuracy and stability of multiple relaxation time (MRT)
   collision operator over its single relaxation time (SRT) counterpart,
   new lifting relations are proposed here to construct single particle
   distribution functions for MRT-LBM from macroscopic variables. Using
   these lifting relations, a new hybrid FVM-LB method is presented (called
   Finite type-LB hybrid method), which is consistent with MRT-LBM. In this
   new hybrid method, single-particle distribution functions in MRT-LBM
   sub-domain boundaries are computed, using equilibrium and
   non-equilibrium moments. These moments are computed in Navier-Stokes/FVM
   sub-domain boundaries, using macroscopic variables and their
   derivatives. The new method is validated by solving three benchmark
   problems, i.e., two- and three-dimensional lid driven cavity flows and
   two-dimensional unsteady flow around a squared section cylinder. These
   problems are analyzed with pure FVM, pure LBM, and Finite type-LB hybrid
   method (FTLBHM) and the related results are compared with each other and
   with benchmark data. These comparisons clearly demonstrate the accuracy
   of the present novel methodology for simulating steady/unsteady flow
   fields in two and three dimensions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Results of corrosion testing on eight alloys from five copper alloy
   families common in the consumer electronics industry-copper nickel tin
   (CuNiSn), copper beryllium (CuBe), copper titanium (CuTi), phosphor
   bronze (CuSnP), and Corson alloys (CuNiSiX)-are presented. Short-term
   exposures were conducted in simulated consumer environments such as a
   salted carbonated cola beverage, artifcial human perspiration, and
   phosphate-buffered saline. Longer-term, conventional salt fog testing,
   up to 1,000 h, was also conducted. In all of these tests, CuNiSn showed
   the lowest corrosion rate followed closely by CuBe alloys. Corrosion
   rates of CuTi alloys were consistently the highest after short-term
   testing, while CuSnP showed the highest corrosion rate after salt fog
   testing.}},

Abstract = {{Ab initio calculations based on a combined method of density functional
   theory (DFT) and nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism are
   performed to study the electrical transport properties of Ge-4, Sn2Ge2,
   and Sn-4 clusters which are coupled to Au(111) electrodes through
   sulfur. The current-voltage (I-V) curves of these molecular junctions
   are determined for different bias voltages. Except Sn-4, these clusters
   show negative differential resistance (NDR) effects at a certain
   high-bias range. The contribution of transmission coefficients and
   number of DOS peaks within the bias window explain I-V characteristics.
   The contributions of electronic states within the bias window due to
   presence of a nanocluster and its thiol counterpart are predicted from
   the bias dependent projected density of states (PDOS) analyses. The NDR
   effect is further analyzed from the molecular projected self-consistent
   Hamiltonian states under different external bias voltages. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this study we develop a model that optimizes the price for new and
   remanufactured short life-cycle products where demands are
   time-dependent and price sensitive. While there has been very few
   published works that attempt to model remanufacturing decisions for
   products with short life cycle, we believe that there are many
   situations where remanufacturing short life cycle products is rewarding
   economically as well as environmentally. The system that we model
   consists of a retailer, a manufacturer, and a collector of used product
   from the end customers. Two different scenarios are evaluated for the
   system. The first is the independent situation where each party attempts
   to maximize his/her own total profit and the second is the joint profit
   model where we optimize the combined total profit for all three members
   of the supply chain. Manufacturer acts as the Stackelberg leader in the
   independently optimized scenario, while in the other the intermediate
   prices are determined by coordinated pricing policy. The results suggest
   that (i) reducing the price of new products during the decline phase
   does not give better profit for the whole system, (ii) the total profit
   obtained from optimizing each player is lower than the total profit of
   the integrated model, and (iii) speed of change in demand influences the
   robustness of the prices as well as the total profit gained. (c) 2014

Title = {{Earthworm-induced carboxylesterase activity in soil: Assessing the
   potential for detoxification and monitoring organophosphorus pesticides}},
Journal = {{ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{303-312}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Soil enzyme activities are attracting widespread interest due to its
   potential use in contaminant breakdown, and as indicators of soil
   deterioration. However, given the multiple environmental and
   methodological factors affecting their activity levels, assessment of
   soil pollution using these biochemical endpoints is still complex.
   Taking advantage of the well-known stimulatory effect of earthworms on
   soil microbes, and their associated enzyme activities, we explored some
   toxicological features of carboxylesterases (CbEs) in soils inoculated
   with Lumbricus terrestris. A microplate-scale spectrophotometric assay
   using soil-water suspensions was first optimized, in which kinetic assay
   parameters (K-m, V-max, dilution of soil homogenate, and duration of
   soil homogenization) were established for further CbE determinations.
   Optimal conditions included a soil-to-water ratio of 1:50 (w/v), 30-min
   of shaking, and 2.5 mM of substrate concentration. As expected, CbE
   activity increased significantly in soils treated with L. terrestris.
   This bioturbed soil was used for exploring the role of CbE activity as a
   bioscavenger for organophosphorus (OP) pesticides. Soil treated with two
   formulations of chlorpyrifos revealed that ODE activity was a
   significant molecular sink for this pesticide, reducing its impact on
   soil microbial activity as shown by the unchanged dehydrogenase
   activity. Dose-dependent curves were adjusted to an exponential kinetic
   model, and the median ecological dose (ED50) for both pesticide
   formulations was calculated. ED50 values decreased as the time of
   pesticide exposure increased (14d-ED50S =20.4-26.7 mg kg(-1), and
   28d-ED(50)s=1.8-23 mg kg(-1)), which suggested that chlorpyrifos was
   progressively transformed into its highly toxic metabolite
   chlorpyrifos-oxon, but simultaneously was inactivated by CbEs. These
   results were confirmed by in vitro assays that showed chlorpyrifos-oxon
   was a more potent CbE inhibitor (IC50 =35.5-4.67 nM) than chlorpyrifos
   (0.41-0.84 mu M). The results showed that earthworm-induced CbE activity
   is an efficient bioscavengers for OP pesticides, acting as a soil
   safeguarding system. Moreover, the simple dose-response curves against
   OP exposure suggest that this enzyme - combined with other enzyme
   activities (e.g., dehydrogenase) - may be a suitable biomarker of
   pesticide exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Analytical model for photon peripheral dose estimation in radiotherapy
   treatments}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS \& ENGINEERING EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This work aims to generate a simple analytical model that allows
   estimation of peripheral photon equivalent dose to organs of individual
   patients, valid for any isocentric technique. Photon radiation scattered
   in the LINAC head has been simulated as a virtual source of radiation
   emitting isotropically so that, before reaching a point inside the
   patient, it decreases with the square law and with attenuation due to
   air and tissue. Leakage has been simulated as a constant background dose
   along the patient. Firstly, a dose-to-points basic model was proposed
   and parameterized by fitting it to absorbed doses measured with TLD-700
   in a humanoid phantom. Secondly, this model was generalized to any other
   situation involving intensity-modulated beams of any size and shape.
   Validation of this general model, usable beyond 10 cm from the field
   edge, was carried out by comparing estimation with TLD-100 doses for
   VMAT and IMRT treatments as well as with experimental data and models
   existing in the bibliography. Finally, an equivalent dose-to-organs
   model has been proposed by rescaling individual anatomical dimensions
   onto a mathematical phantom in order to make an estimation of organ
   length for dose calculation. The parameterized extended model,
   accounting for intensity-modulated beams of any shape, predicts
   measurements with a maximum relative uncertainty of +/- 25\%. This
   general model, easy to apply in a clinical routine thanks to the ready
   availability of input parameters, has been proposed and validated for
   estimation of photon equivalent doses to peripheral organs. Finally, as
   a first step, it has been implemented into a piece of software termed
   PERIPHOCAL (PERIpheral PHOton CALculation), which is easily transferred
   to a commercial treatment planning system (TPS).}},

   Synthetase/RNase L Pathway Using at Least Two Distinct Mechanisms}},

Abstract = {{The innate immune response is the first line of defense of the host cell
   against a viral infection. In turn, viruses have evolved a wide variety
   of strategies to hide from, and to directly antagonize, the host innate
   immune pathways. One of these pathways is the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate
   synthetase (OAS)/RNase L pathway. OAS is activated by double-stranded
   RNA (dsRNA) to produce 2'-5' oligoadenylates, which are the activators
   of RNase L; this enzyme degrades viral and cellular RNAs, restricting
   viral infection. It has been recently found that the carboxy-terminal
   domain (CTD) of rotavirus VP3 has a 2'-5'-phosphodiesterase (PDE)
   activity that is able to functionally substitute for the PDE activity of
   the mouse hepatitis virus ns2 protein. This particular phosphodiesterase
   cleaves the 2'-5'-phosphodiester bond of the oligoadenylates,
   antagonizing the OAS/RNase L pathway. However, whether this activity of
   VP3 is relevant during the replication cycle of rotavirus is not known.
   Here, we demonstrate that after rotavirus infection the OAS/RNase L
   complex becomes activated; however, the virus is able to control its
   activity using at least two distinct mechanisms. A virus-cell
   interaction that occurs during or before rotavirus endocytosis triggers
   a signal that prevents the early activation of RNase L, while later on
   the control is taken by the newly synthesized VP3. Cosilencing the
   expression of VP3 and RNase L in infected cells yields viral infectious
   particles at levels similar to those obtained in control infected cells,
   where no genes were silenced, suggesting that the capping activity of
   VP3 is not essential for the formation of infectious viral particles.
   IMPORTANCE Rotaviruses represent an important cause of severe
   gastroenteritis in the young of many animal species, including humans.
   In this work, we have found that the OAS/RNase L pathway is activated
   during rotavirus infection, but the virus uses two different strategies
   to prevent the deleterious effects of this innate immune response of the
   cell. Early during virus entry, the initial interactions of the viral
   particle with the cell result in the inhibition of RNase L activity
   during the first hours of the infection. Later on, once viral proteins
   are synthesized, the phosphodiesterase activity of VP3 degrades the
   cellular 2'-5'-oligoadenylates, which are potent activators of RNase L,
   preventing its activation. This work demonstrates that the OAS/RNase L
   pathway plays an important role during infection and that the
   phosphodiesterase activity of VP3 is relevant during the replication
   cycle of the virus.}},

Journal = {{AUTONOMIC NEUROSCIENCE-BASIC \& CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{193}},
Pages = {{104-107}},

Abstract = {{Background: Clinical observations have suggested repeated
   gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) exposure to cause intestinal
   dysfunction and loss of enteric neurons. This has been further studied
   and confirmed in a rat in vivo model involving iterated GnRH treatments.
   Mechanisms behind are enigmatic since no GnRH receptors are found to be
   expressed in enteric neurons neither in man nor rat. Both species,
   however, harbor substantial subpopulations of luteinizing hormone (LH)
   receptor-immunoreactive myenteric neurons which suggests that intestinal
   GnRH-induced neuropathy may be mediated by LH release.
   Aims: To reveal if exposures of GnRH or LH to rat myenteric neurons in
   vitro cause neuronal loss.
   Methods: Primary cultured adult rat myenteric neurons were exposed to
   single or repeated treatments of the GnRH analog buserelin or the LH
   analog lutrotropin alpha, and neuronal survival was determined by cell
   counting. Possible presence of GnRH- or LH receptor -immunoreactive
   neurons was determined by immunocytochemistry.
   Results: Exposure to the LH, but not the GnRH, analog caused
   significantly reduced neuronal survival. LH, but not GnRH, receptors
   were found to be expressed on cultured myenteric neurons.
   Conclusion: Myenteric neurons express LH receptors in vitro and LH
   exposure causes reduced neuronal survival. This suggests that
   GnRH-induced enteric neuropathy in vivo is mediated by way of LH release
   and activation of enteric neuronal LH receptors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Chronic immune mediated inflammation is characterized by continuous
   chemokine mediated recruitment and activation of pro-inflammatory cells,
   monocytes in particular. We believe that an evaluation of the
   recruitment profile of monocytes during healthy condition is essential
   for the understanding of cellular response in disease. For this, we have
   established normal reference values and 95\% confidence intervals for
   receptor expression of 20 chemokine receptors on monocyte subsets;
   classical (CD14(+)CD16(-)), non-classical (CD14(+)CD16(+)) and HLA-DRhi
   monocytes from 20 healthy controls using flow cytometry. We demonstrate
   significant differences in the chemokine receptor expression profiles
   and high correlation between fraction of cells and level of expression.
   This is the first global approach to provide a platform for comparable
   evaluation of cell recruitment during normal and under inflammatory
   conditions. This will be useful when exploring chemokine-chemokine
   receptor interactions, inhibition of chemokine signaling and selective
   removal of migrating cells, which are new treatment strategies in immune
   mediated diseases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Randomized trials demonstrate clear benefits of mammography
   screening in women through age 74 years. We explored age-and
   race-specific rates of mammography screening and breast cancer mortality
   among women aged 69 to 84 years.
   METHODS: We analyzed Medicare claims data for women residing within
   Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results geographic areas from 1995 to
   2009 from 64,384 non-Hispanic women (4886 black and 59,498 white) and
   ascertained all primary breast cancer cases diagnosed between ages 69
   and 84 years. The exposure was annual or biennial screening mammography
   during the 4 years immediately preceding diagnosis. The outcome was
   breast cancer mortality during the 10 years immediately after diagnosis.
   RESULTS: After adjustment for stage at diagnosis, radiation therapy,
   chemotherapy, comorbid conditions, and contextual socioeconomic status,
   hazard ratios (and 95\% confidence intervals) for breast cancer
   mortality relative to no/irregular mammography at 10 years for women
   aged 69 to 84 years at diagnosis were 0.31 (0.29-0.33) for annual
   mammography and 0.47 (0.44-0.51) for biennial mammography among whites
   and 0.36 (0.29-0.44) for annual mammography and 0.47 (0.37-0.58) for
   biennial mammography among blacks. Trends were similar at 5 years
   overall and stratified by ages 69 to 74 years, 75 to 78 years, and 79 to
   84 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: In these Medicare claims and Surveillance, Epidemiology and
   End Results data, elderly non-Hispanic women who self-selected for
   annual mammography had lower 10-year breast cancer mortality than
   corresponding women who self-selected for biennial or no/irregular
   mammography. These findings were similar among black and white women.
   The data highlight the evidentiary limitations of data used for current
   screening mammography recommendations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{During the last century, the global population of the Great Bustard
   (Otis tarda) has decreased and this species is now considered
   vulnerable. In Iran, the status of this species is much more critical
   and its distribution is limited to a few areas of Bukan county. We
   modeled the suitability of habitat for Great Bustards in Bukan County
   with the goal of determining the most important of distribution limiting
   factors of this valuable, rare and endangered bird in order to
   conservation and The map of effective factors including landform, land
   use, water resources and human factors was prepared using field data,
   previous available data, interpretation of satellite images, and their
   processing and analysis in GIS. To prepare the map of the variables, the
   circular, distance, and frequency analyses and for normalization of the
   maps, Box-Cox conversion were used. The model validation and the map
   classification of habitat suitability to desirable and undesirable
   classes were conducted using the Boyce index. The marginality factor
   (1.28) indicated that Otis tarda tends to live in marginal habitats. Low
   tolerability (0.1) and high specialization (9.2) scores also indicate
   that it is a special species within the county. According to our
   suitability map, only 6.5\% (16000 ha) of the study area consists of

Abstract = {{Notwithstanding the importance of materials, microstructure also plays a
   significant role in performances of solid oxide cells. X-ray
   nanotomography with a voxel size of 25 nm was used to image the
   microstructure of CGO-LSCF composite oxygen electrode obtained by
   electrostatic spray deposition (ESD). The stack of data was used to
   create a 3D model. Two volumes were selected from the 3D model and
   microstructural parameters like porosity, surface area, percolation path
   and tortuosity factor were computed to quantify the microstructure. The
   influence of the applied threshold values on the parameters was
   investigated. Comparison of these parameters with previously reported
   data has shown significant differences. The porosity of CGO-LSCF oxygen
   electrode varied from 67 to 87 vol.\%. Such a high porosity level makes
   this ESD microstructure unique. The microstructural parameters were used
   to determine the electrode polarization by Adler-Lane-Steele model.
   Modeled polarization resistance was in an agreement with experimental
   data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the combustion, performance and emission

   Injection (PCCI-DI) Engine with premixed fuels ethanol and gasohol (90\%
   gasoline and 10\% ethanol by volume) along with direct injection of
   diesel fuel into the combustion chamber. The experiments were conducted
   in a four stroke, naturally aspirated, air cooled, constant speed diesel
   engine with 20\% premixed fuels from no load to full load condition. The
   addition of premixed fuel enhances the air fuel mixture strength and for
   that the combustion duration is decreased in dual fuel operation. From
   this experiment it was observed the 70\% and 67\% reduction in smoke
   emission from premixed gasohol and ethanol fuel when compared to neat
   diesel operation. In addition to that, the oxides of nitrogen emissions
   were reduced to 30\% and 24\% for premixed gasohol and ethanol fuel. In
   particular, premixed gasohol reduces the smoke and oxides of nitrogen
   emissions more than the ethanol and also, significant increase in brake
   thermal efficiency was noted in 20\% premixed gasohol and ethanol in
   dual fuel mode, when compared to neat diesel operation. (C) 2015 Faculty

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design, development, and characterization of
   two wireless instrumented crutches for gait monitoring in order to
   provide clinicians quantitative parameters of upper limbs' contributions
   during walking. These parameters could be used to teach orthopedic
   patients to correctly use these supports and minimize problems connected
   to their usage. These instrumented crutches allow monitoring axial
   forces and shear forces, tilt angles, and time of impact on the ground
   in real time. Each crutch is composed of three strain-gauge bridges for
   measuring axial and shear forces, a conditioning circuit with
   transmission module, a triaxial accelerometer, a power management
   circuit, two batteries, and a biofeedback. The data are wirelessly
   transmitted via Bluetooth without needing any further readout unit, from
   the crutches to a personal computer, where the data are processed and
   displayed by a program created in LabVIEW. Each instrumented crutch was
   tested to assess the response of the accelerometer and the three
   strain-gauge bridges using a setup designed ad hoc. The mean
   experimental standard deviation was about 42 mV for axial forces
   corresponding to about 8 N and about 35 mV for shear forces
   corresponding to about 4 N. Hysteresis, linearity, and drift were
   calculated, and the obtained accuracy was about 8-9 N for axial forces
   and 4-5 N for shear forces. Furthermore, the crutches were tested during
   a walking activity of ten healthy subjects along a straight path for
   several trials. These crutches were used for a common analysis usually
   reported in the literature for weight bearing evaluation. The subjects
   were monitored performing a nonweight bearing (NWB) and a partial weight
   bearing (PWB) during a three-point gait. The results showed a mean of
   102\%+/- 16\% for NWB tests and a mean of 19\%+/- 14\% for 10\% PWB
   tests; these values are in agreement with similar studies in the
   literature. The simplicity that includes only constitutive strain gauges
   and a separable circuit board allows the achievement of the objectives
   of simplicity, ease of use, and noninvasiveness. Therefore, these
   crutches could be used as a support tool for controlling the use of
   crutches during walking not only in hospitals but also at home.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major challenges in traffic safety analyses is the
   heterogeneous nature of safety data, due to the sundry factors involved
   in it. This heterogeneity often leads to difficulties in interpreting
   results and conclusions due to unrevealed relationships. Understanding
   the underlying relationship between injury seventies and influential
   factors is critical for the selection of appropriate safety
   countermeasures. A method commonly employed to address systematic
   heterogeneity is to focus on any subgroup of data based on the research
   purpose. However, this need not ensure homogeneity in the data. In this
   paper, latent class cluster analysis is applied to identify homogenous
   subgroups for a specific crash type-pedestrian crashes. The manuscript
   employs data from police reported pedestrian (2009-2012) crashes in
   Switzerland. The analyses demonstrate that dividing pedestrian severity
   data into seven clusters helps in reducing the systematic heterogeneity
   of the data and to understand the hidden relationships between crash
   severity levels and socio-demographic, environmental, vehicle, temporal,
   traffic factors, and main reason for the crash. The pedestrian crash
   injury severity models were developed for the whole data and individual
   clusters, and were compared using receiver operating characteristics
   curve, for which results favored clustering. Overall, the study suggests
   that latent class clustered regression approach is suitable for reducing
   heterogeneity and revealing important hidden relationships in traffic
   safety analyses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Comparisons between structures of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (AR)
   bound to either agonists, partial agonists, or weak partial agonists led
   to the proposal that rotamer changes of Ser(5.46), coupled to a
   contraction of the binding pocket, are sufficient to increase the
   probability of receptor activation.
   (RS)-4-{[}3-(tert-butylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy]-1H-indole-2-carbonitrile
   (cyanopindolol) is a weak partial agonist of beta(1)AR and, based on the
   hypothesis above, we predicted that the addition of a methyl group to
   form
   4-{[}(2S)-3-(tert-butylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy]-7-methyl-1H-indole-2-car
   bonitrile (7-methylcyanopindolol) would dramatically reduce its
   efficacy. An eight-step synthesis of 7-methylcyanopindolol was developed
   and its pharmacology was analyzed. 7-Methylcyanopindolol bound with
   similar affinity to cyanopindolol to both beta(1)AR and beta(2)AR. As
   predicted, the efficacy of 7-methylcyanopindolol was reduced
   significantly compared with cyanopindolol, acting as a very weak partial
   agonist of turkey beta(1)AR and an inverse agonist of human beta(2)AR.
   The structure of 7-methylcyanopindolol-bound beta(1)AR was determined to
   2.4 angstrom-resolution and found to be virtually identical to the
   structure of cyanopindolol-bound beta(1)AR. The major differences in the
   orthosteric binding pocket are that it has expanded by 0.3-angstrom in
   7-methylcyanopindolol-bound beta(1)AR and the hydroxyl group of
   Ser(5.46) is positioned 0.8 angstrom further from the ligand, with
   respect to the position of the Ser(5.46) side chain in
   cyanopindolol-bound beta(1)AR. Thus, the molecular basis for the
   reduction in efficacy of 7-methylcyanopindolol compared with
   cyanopindolol may be regarded as the opposite of the mechanism proposed
   for the increase in efficacy of agonists compared with antagonists.}},

Abstract = {{As for terrestrial remote sensing, pixel-based classifiers have
   traditionally been used to map coral reef habitats. For pixel-based
   classifiers, habitat assignment is based on the spectral or textural
   properties of each individual pixel in the scene. More recently,
   however, object-based classifications, those based on information from a
   set of contiguous pixels with similar properties, have found favor with
   the reef mapping community and are starting to be extensively deployed.
   Object-based classifiers have an advantage over pixel-based in that they
   are less compromised by the inevitable inhomogeneity in per-pixel
   spectral response caused, primarily, by variations in water depth. One
   aspect of the object-based classification workflow is the assignment of
   each image object to a habitat class on the basis of its spectral,
   textural, or geometric properties. While a skilled image interpreter can
   achieve this task accurately through manual editing, full or partial
   automation is desirable for large-scale reef mapping projects of the
   magnitude which are useful for marine spatial planning. To this end,
   this paper trials the use of multinomial logistic discrete choice models
   to classify coral reef habitats identified through object-based
   segmentation of satellite imagery. Our results suggest that these models
   can attain assignment accuracies of about 85\%, while also reducing the
   time needed to produce the map, as compared to manual methods.
   Limitations of this approach include misclassification of image objects
   at the interface between some habitat types due to the soft gradation in
   nature between habitats, the robustness of the segmentation algorithm
   used, and the selection of a strong training dataset. Finally, due to
   the probabilistic nature of multinomial logistic models, the analyst can
   estimate a map of uncertainty associated with the habitat
   classifications. Quantifying uncertainty is important to the end-user
   when developing marine spatial planning scenarios and populating spatial
   models from reef habitat maps.}},

Abstract = {{The term `resilience' is increasingly being used in a multitude of
   contexts. Seemingly the latest `buzz' word, it can mean many things to
   many people, in many different situations. In the natural hazard
   context, the terms `sustainable planning', and `resilience planning' are
   now being used, often interchangeably. But from a natural hazard
   perspective, is a resilient community a sustainable one? In order to be
   sustainable, does a community need to be resilient? The purpose of this
   paper is to answer these two questions, and stimulate discussion on how
   the two terms are being used. The paper provides an overview of
   resilience and sustainability within a land use planning and natural
   hazard context, and discusses how they are interrelated. The New Zealand
   legislative requirements for resilience and sustainability are outlined,
   followed by the presentation of an example from the earthquake impacted
   city of Christchurch, New Zealand. This example outlines the planning
   response to the earthquakes, and the sustainable and resilient planning
   options being implemented. The discussion shows that a resilient
   community should also be a sustainable community, in order to meet
   legislative requirements, and more importantly - to ensure the needs of
   future generations are met, economically, socially, culturally, and
   environmentally. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite medical advancements, the inflammatory cascade and oxidative
   stress worsen the prognosis in most cases of peritonitis. Curcumin has
   emerged as a potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent in few of
   the acute inflammatory and infective conditions. We examined the effect
   of intraperitoneal injection of curcumin in endotoxin-induced
   peritonitis in rats. The blood and peritoneal fluid samples were
   collected at 3 and 24 h following the induction of peritonitis. Animals
   were sacrificed at 24 h and the organs preserved. The histopathological
   report of lung, liver, and intestines in the curcumin-treated rats
   showed maintenance of tissue architecture to a large extent compared to
   the control group which showed massive congestion, hemorrhage, and
   necrosis. The blood and peritoneal fluid total count and differential
   neutrophil counts were significantly higher at 24 h of induction of
   peritonitis. Serum amyloid assay and lipid peroxidation were
   significantly lower, and myeloperoxidase assay was higher in the
   curcumin-treated group at the end of 24 h; thus, curcumin probably
   demonstrated a neutrophil-mediated immunopotentiation and
   anti-inflammatory action thereby protecting the animal from
   endotoxemia-induced multi-organ damage.}},

Title = {{Cortisol covariation within parents of young children: Moderation by
   relationship aggression}},
Journal = {{PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{121-128}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Covariation in diurnal cortisol has been observed in several studies of
   cohabiting couples. In two such studies (Liu et al., 2013; Saxbe and
   Repetti, 2010), relationship distress was associated with stronger
   within-couple correlations, suggesting that couples' physiological
   linkage with each other may indicate problematic dyadic functioning.
   Although intimate partner aggression has been associated with
   dysregulation in women's diurnal cortisol, it has not yet been tested as
   a moderator of within-couple covariation.
   This study reports on a diverse sample of 122 parents who sampled
   salivary cortisol on matched days for two years following the birth of
   an infant. Partners showed strong positive cortisol covariation. In
   couples with higher levels of partner-perpetrated aggression reported by
   women at one year postpartum, both women and men had a flatter diurnal
   decrease in cortisol and stronger correlations with partners' cortisol
   sampled at the same timepoints. In other words, relationship aggression
   was linked both with indices of suboptimal cortisol rhythms in both
   members of the couples and with stronger within-couple covariation
   coefficients. These results persisted when relationship satisfaction and
   demographic covariates were included in the model. During some of the
   sampling days, some women were pregnant with a subsequent child, but
   pregnancy did not significantly moderate cortisol levels or
   within-couple covariation.
   The findings suggest that couples experiencing relationship aggression
   have both suboptimal neuroendocrine profiles and stronger covariation.
   Cortisol covariation is an understudied phenomenon with potential
   implications for couples' relationship functioning and physical health.

Abstract = {{This study applies a stochastic frontier gravity model to examine Laos'
   export potential as well as factors hindering its export growth. This
   article uses a panel data of thirty-four importing countries from 2001
   to 2011. Three main export growth factors are analysed in the model: (i)
   core factors (income per capita, population, and distance); (ii)
   implicit behind-the-border constraints; and (iii) implicit
   beyond-the-border constraints. The findings show that only half of the
   country's export potential has been realized to date and export losses
   can primarily be attributed to implicit behind-the-border constraints.
   At the same time, these constraints have been reduced during the last
   decade. This article identifies border trade, a common language, income
   per capita and the Generalized System of Preferences scheme as important
   factors for export growth. Conversely, it finds that an appreciating
   real exchange rate is a signal of a slowdown in export growth.}},

   by modeling the solar cell as a multilayer medium of thin films and a
   substrate, using the transfer matrix method. The analytical model is
   verified through reflectance measurements on a GaAs(1-x)Px/GaP stack.
   Our results show that optimized double-and triple-layer ARCs can
   minimize reflectance to below 5\% within the spectral range of similar
   to 400-945 nm, with the latter maintaining this performance over a
   broader spectrum of 390-1000 nm, in comparison to 25-45\% reflectance

Abstract = {{Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited condition secondary
   to germline mutations in the APC gene, thus resulting in the formation
   of hundreds of colonic adenomas that eventually progress into colon
   cancer. Surgical removal of the colon remains the only treatment option
   to avoid malignancy, as long-term exposure to chemopreventive agents
   such as sulindac (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and silymarin
   (phytoestrogen) is not feasible. Here, we have developed a multistage
   silicon-based drug delivery platform for sulindac and silymarin that
   preferentially interacts with colon cancer cells as opposed to normal
   intestinal mucosa. Preferential binding and internalization of these
   drugs into colon cancer cells was obtained using a targeting strategy
   against the protein meprin A, which we demonstrate is overexpressed in
   human colon cancer cells and in the small intestine of Apc(Min/+) mice.
   We propose that this delivery system could potentially be used to reduce
   drug-induced side effects in FAP patients, thus enabling long-term
   prevention of adenoma formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Eighteen polymorphic microsatellite loci and 11 single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms were genotyped in 1 095 individual Hessian fly specimens
   representing 23 populations from North America, southern Europe, and
   southwest Asia. The genotypes were used to assess genetic diversity and
   interrelationship of Hessian fly populations. While phylogenetic
   analysis indicates that the American populations most similar to
   Eurasian populations come from the east coast of the United States,
   genetic distance is least between (Alabama and California) and
   (Kazakhstan and Spain). Allelic diversity and frequency vary across
   North America, but they are not correlated with distance from the
   historically documented point of introduction in New York City or with
   temperature or precipitation. Instead, the greatest allelic diversity
   mostly occurs in areas with Mediterranean climates. The microsatellite
   data indicate a general deficiency for heterozygotes in Hessian fly. The
   North American population structure is consistent with multiple
   introductions, isolation by distance, and human-abetted dispersal by
   bulk transport of puparia in infested straw or on harvesting equipment.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Delayed graft function (DGF) is a common complication in
   renal transplant and has implications for its development. Objectives:
   To know its incidence in a single transplant center, to describe the
   risk factors in donor and recipient, the procedure and the evolution of
   the graft and recipient. Methods: 178 renal transplant patients (P) with
   grafts from cadaveric donors were studied. Delayed graft function was
   defined as dialysis requirement in the first week post transplantation.
   We analyzed risk factors in the donor and recipient as well as the
   transplant procedures. Results: DGF incidence was 75.8\% (135 patients).
   Risk factors for DGF were: greater cold ischemia time in minutes (1389
   vs. 1224; P=0.01), greater recipient's age in years (47.24 vs 40.71;
   P=0.001) and greater BMI of the donor (27.5 vs 25.17; P=0.001). In 170
   patients the presence of rejection was evaluated: those who had DGF
   presented more rejections (35.6\% vs. 19.5\%; P=0.046). The group with
   DGF showed lower graft survival at 5 years (P=0.0473), there was no
   difference in patient survival. Conclusion: The DGF incidence is higher
   than reported in the literature. Efforts should be made to reduce its
   incidence, focusing in reducing cold ischemia and improving maintenance
   of the donor.}},

Title = {{Using color-odor correspondences for fragrance packaging design}},
Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{17-25}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Fragrance companies may use colors in packaging design to communicate
   the properties of their fragrances. Packages with matching colors may
   have an additional advantage: some studies suggest that consumers prefer
   offerings for which all sensory impressions are congruent. Hence, we
   investigated whether consumers are more likely to buy fragrances with a
   matching package.
   For five fragrances we created a package, based on a harmonious
   combination of three colors that obtained high odor-color goodness-of
   fit ratings in a previous study. Packages were identical in design,
   except for the colors used. The appropriateness ratings for the five
   packages were indeed found to be related to the ratings for its major
   colors.
   Subsequently, we assessed the degree to which participants were likely
   to buy different fragrance-package combinations. However, buying
   intentions were not affected by the degree of matching between fragrance
   and packaging. Instead, they were typically dependent on the degree of
   liking for the fragrance and, to a lesser extent, on the degree of
   liking for the package. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As in other OECD countries, female and maternal employment rates have
   increased tremendously in Germany, though there is still a wage ``gender
   gap{''} which is largest for women with children. This is often
   explained by the depreciation of human capital, the signaling effect of
   (long) employment breaks and the possible discrimination of mothers in
   the labour market. However, research has neglected the question what
   influence it has whether mothers stay out of work beyond the maximal
   length of the legal leave of absence or not. We expect wage penalties
   particularly for those mothers who extend their leave of absence.
   Besides we examine whether the negative impact of employment
   interruptions varies between mothers with different amounts of human
   capital in the form of vocational qualifications and between East and
   West Germany. Our analysis is based on data from the GSOEP (1984-2011)
   and controls for unobserved heterogeneity. Overall, our results show
   that there is no general or permanent ``motherhood wage penalty{''}, but
   that mainly breaks exceeding the legally suggested duration lead to
   lower wages, as they probably signal a low career orientation of
   mothers. Further, education plays a crucial role: Especially women with
   low secondary education and vocational training suffer from large,
   permanent wage penalties while other mothers suffer only from smaller,
   non-permanent penalties or even experience no penalties.}},

Title = {{An evaluation of the `weekend effect' in patients admitted with

Journal = {{BJU INTERNATIONAL}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   To investigate whether mortality is increased for patients with
   metastatic prostate cancer (mCaP) admitted over the weekend.
   Patients and Methods
   Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) between 1998 and 2009,
   admitted patients with a diagnosis of prostate cancer and concomitant
   metastases were identified. Rates of in-hospital mortality,
   complications, use of imaging and procedures were assessed. Adjusted
   logistic regression models examined associations of mortality and
   complications.
   Results
   A weighted sample of 534 011 patients with mCaP was identified,
   including 81.7\% weekday and 18.3\% weekend admissions. Of these, 8.6\%
   died after a weekday vs 10.9\% after a weekend admission (P < 0.001).
   Patients admitted over the weekend were more likely to be treated at
   rural (17.8\% vs 15.7\%), non-teaching (57.6\% vs 53.7\%) and low-volume
   hospitals (53.4\% vs 49.4\%) (all P < 0.001) compared with weekday
   admissions. They presented higher rates of organ failure (25.2\% vs
   21.3\%), and were less likely to undergo an interventional procedure
   (10.6\% vs 11.4\%) (all P < 0.001). More patients admitted over the
   weekend had pneumonia (12.2\% vs 8.8\%), pyelonephritis (18.3\% vs
   14.1\%) and sepsis (4.5\% vs. 3.5\%) (all P < 0.001). In multivariate
   analysis, weekend admission was associated with an increased likelihood
   of complications (odds ratio {[}OR] 1.15, 95\% confidence Interval
   {[}CI] 1.11-1.19) and mortality (OR 1.20, 95\% CI 1.14-1.27).
   Conclusion
   In patients with mCaP weekend admissions are associated with a
   significant increase in mortality and morbidity. Our findings suggest
   that weekend patients may present with more acute medical issues;
   alternatively, the quality of care over the weekend may be inferior.}},

Volume = {{785}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The wake behind a circular cylinder in Mach 4 flow is examined
   experimentally in the Reynolds number range 2 x 10(4) to 5 x 10(5).
   Periodic oscillations of the sliplines in the wake are observed. The
   Strouhal number of the oscillations based on the diameter of the
   cylinder is found to increase monotonically from 0.30 to 0.50 with
   increasing Reynolds number. If the Strouhal number is formed using the
   length of the sliplines, however, it has a constant value of
   approximately 0.48 for all Reynolds numbers studied. This scaling
   indicates that the oscillations in supersonic flow are likely driven by
   acoustic signals propagating back and forth through the subsonic region
   between the separation points on the cylinder and the neck where the
   sliplines converge, unlike in subsonic flow where oscillations are
   caused by vortices shed from the cylinder surface.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of four commercially available bio-active compounds on the
   infection rates, symptom expression and growth rates of apple trees
   (Malus x domestica Borkh.) cv. Golden Delicious infected with
   `Candidatus Phytoplasma mali' (the so-called Apple Proliferation
   phytoplasma or AP) were tested over a three-year period under controlled
   conditions. Post-infection treatments using Bion (R) (active ingredient:
   Acibenzolar-S-Methyl), Messenger (R) (Harpin protein), Regalis (R)
   (Prohexadione-Ca) and Dormex (R) (Cyanamide) had no significant effect
   on infection rates. Terminal growth of apple trees (grown as one-shoot
   pruned trees) was increased significantly by AP infection;
   Prohexadione-Ca was the only compound which had a significant
   (inhibiting) effect on the growth of both infected and non-infected
   apple trees. Acibenzolar-S-Methyl and Harpin had no significant effects
   on symptom expression. AP symptoms were masked during summer by
   Prohexadione-Ca, which caused severe growth abnormalities. Cyanamide
   changed the seasonal appearance of AP symptoms: while symptoms were
   delayed compared to the untreated control the first two years (2008 and
   2009), symptoms appeared earlier the third year (2010). Differences in
   symptom expression levelled off later in the vegetative season, and no
   significant difference was found in October.}},

Abstract = {{The distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) is a complex structure that
   participates in forearm rotation (articulatio bicondylaris) together
   with the proximal radioulnar joint (PRUJ). The radius and ulna are
   connected by the interosseous membrane, whereby the ulna represents the
   fixed longitudinal axis of the forearm, whereas the radius rotates
   around the ulna. A pure rotation occurs in the PRUJ whereas in the DRUJ
   a rotation and additionally a translational motion occur. Within these
   movements around the longitudinal axis a mobility of the hand in
   different directions is possible. Disorders of the wrist are often
   combined with DRUJ instability mostly due to ligament or bony avulsion
   of the triangular fibrocartilage complex. Furthermore, incongruity of
   the tilt of the sigmoid notch of the distal radius due to fractures or
   persistent dislocation also results in instability and reduction in
   forearm movement. Without treatment this can lead to osteoarthritis of
   the DRUJ or dynamic radioulnar impingement after loss of the ulnar head
   due to salvage operations.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) is thought to reduce
   the rate of thromboembolic and bleeding events compared with aortic root
   replacement using a mechanical aortic root replacement (MRR) with a
   composite graft by avoiding oral anticoagulation. But as VSRR carries a
   certain risk for subsequent reinterventions, decision-making in the
   individual patient can be challenging.
   METHODS: Of 100 Marfan syndrome (MFS) patients who underwent 169 aortic
   surgeries and were followed at our institution since 1995, 59
   consecutive patients without a history of dissection or prior aortic
   surgery underwent elective VSRR or MRR and were retrospectively
   analysed.
   RESULTS: VSRR was performed in 29 (David n = 24, Yacoub n = 5) and MRR
   in 30 patients. The mean age was 33 +/- 15 years. The mean follow-up
   after VSRR was 6.5 +/- 4 years (180 patient-years) compared with 8.8 +/-
   9 years (274 patient-years) after MRR. Reoperation rates after root
   remodelling (Yacoub) were significantly higher than after the
   reimplantation (David) procedure (60 vs 4.2\%, P = 0.01). The need for
   reinterventions after the reimplantation procedure (0.8\% per
   patient-year) was not significantly higher than after MRR (P = 0.44) but
   follow-up after VSRR was significantly shorter (P = 0.03). There was
   neither significant morbidity nor mortality associated with root
   reoperations. There were no neurological events after VSRR compared with
   four stroke/intracranial bleeding events in the MRR group (log-rank, P =
   0.11), translating into an event rate of 1.46\% per patient-year
   following MRR.
   CONCLUSION: The calculated annual failure rate after VSRR using the
   reimplantation technique was lower than the annual risk for
   thromboembolic or bleeding events. Since the perioperative risk of
   reinterventions following VSRR is low, patients might benefit from VSRR
   even if redo surgery may become necessary during follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving high scalability with dynamically adaptive algorithms in
   high-performance computing (HPC) is a non-trivial task. The invasive
   paradigm using compute migration represents an efficient alternative to
   classical data migration approaches for such algorithms in HPC. We
   present a core-distribution scheduler which realizes the migration of
   computational power by distributing the cores depending on the
   requirements specified by one or more parallel program instances. We
   validate our approach with different benchmark suites for simulations
   with artificial workload as well as applications based on dynamically
   adaptive shallow water simulations, and investigate concurrently
   executed adaptivity parameter studies on realistic Tsunami simulations.
   The invasive approach results in significantly faster overall execution
   times and higher hardware utilization than alternative approaches. A
   dynamic resource management is therefore mandatory for a more efficient
   execution of scenarios similar to our simulations, e.g. several Tsunami
   simulations in urgent computing, to overcome strong scalability
   challenges in the area of HPC. The optimizations obtained by invasive
   migration of cores can be generalized to similar classes of algorithms
   with dynamic resource requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Algorithms for the automatic detection and recognition of acoustic
   events are increasingly gaining relevance for the reliable and robust
   functioning of consumer, assistive and monitoring systems. The
   extraction of appropriate task relevant acoustic features from the raw
   sound signal clearly influences performance of subsequent statistical
   classification, in particular in adverse acoustic situations. The
   present contribution investigates the use of biologically-inspired
   features, derived from a filterbank of two-dimensional Gabor functions,
   that decompose the spectro-temporal power density into components which
   capture spectral, temporal and joint spectro-temporal modulation
   patterns. It is hypothesized that the comparably large joint spectral
   and temporal extent of these Gabor functions results in features that
   allow for robust classification. Evaluation of the proposed feature
   extraction scheme together with an hidden Markov model (HMM) classifier
   is conducted on two corpora comprising acoustic events in realistic
   adverse conditions from the D-CASE and CLEAR'07 evaluation campaigns.
   Relevance of each Gabor filter for classification is analyzed and an
   optimized parameter set for the Gabor filterbank (GFB) is identified.
   Performance of the optimized GFB is evaluated in comparison to other
   state-of-the-art algorithms on isolated event classification and on the
   full acoustic event detection (AED) including joint classification and
   temporal segmentation of events. Results show that Gabor features result
   in a signal representation that exhibits separated average
   class-specific patterns. An improvement in classification accuracy of up
   to 26\% relative to the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC)
   baseline is obtained with the optimized GFB. Further experiments
   demonstrate that this improvement cannot be explained by purely temporal
   or purely spectral Gabor basis functions. Rather, a GFB with features
   extending in joint spectro-temporal directions is required to obtain
   optimum performance. Performance on AED with the D-CASE challenge
   dataset is shown to improve on previous algorithms from the recent
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Studies indicate that eating lunch impairs some aspects of
   adults' cognitive functioning. However, the short-term effects of lunch
   on children's executive functions (EF) have not been examined. The
   Cognition Intervention Study Dortmund PLUS (CogniDo PLUS) investigated
   (a) short-term effects of lunch on EF in children and (b) whether the
   postprandial cortisol increase mediates putative lunch effects on EF
   performance.
   Methods: 5th and 6th grade students of a comprehensive school in
   Gelsenkirchen (Germany) participated in the randomized crossover
   intervention study. On Day 1 of the study, Group 1 did not eat lunch,
   whereas Group 2 received lunch ad libitum. One week later on Day 2 the
   groups were treated vice versa. At the beginning of the afternoon
   lessons, the EF parameters task switching, working memory updating and
   inhibition were tested using a computerized test battery. Saliva samples
   were used to measure cortisol directly before lunch and again at the
   beginning of the cognitive assessment. Of the 215 initially recruited
   children 21 dropped out of the study due to illness or absence on one of
   the two test days.
   Results: Lower ratios of false alarms in the working memory updating
   function were observed when children who ate lunch than for children who
   had no lunch (8.2\% (lunch) versus 9.4\% (no lunch), p<0.01). Parameters
   of task switching and inhibition did not differ between children who ate
   lunch compared to children who had no lunch. Stratification according to
   postprandial cortisol increase showed that the subgroup with a high
   increase had lower ratios of false alarms after eating lunch, while
   false alarm values did not change in the group with a low increase.
   Conclusion: In contrast to findings in adults, the results indicate that
   children's EF are not impaired by lunch under true-to-life conditions.
   On the contrary, the current study even indicates beneficial effects of
   lunch intake for the working memory updating. The postprandial cortisol
   increase in the range observed in our sample does not seem to be related
   with negative effects on the performance of EF, but even seem to mediate
   the beneficial effect of lunch on the working memory updating. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The study uniquely described the clinical value of transabdominal
   ultrasonography for monitoring features characterizing the estrous cycle
   in female cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). The reproductive tracts of 21
   female, nulliparous, and relatively aged (median: 11 and interquartile
   range: 9.25-14 years) captive cheetahs resident on two sites in Namibia
   were assessed by transabdominal ultrasound. Subsequently, the ovarian
   findings on ultrasound were compared with direct visualization while
   performing laparoscopic sterilization. A combination of these
   observations supported by concurrent sampling for vaginal cytology and
   serum progesterone concentrations defined the estrous status of
   individual animals. At one site, six cheetahs had been implanted with
   the GnRH agonist, deslorelin as a contraceptive at least once within the
   preceding 11 years. On ultrasound, 31 uterine horns and 35 ovaries with
   discernible structures on 28 (86\%) were visualized in the 21 cheetahs.
   The uterine body was difficult to visualize because of its intrapelvic
   location. Eleven of 19 uteri (58\%) visualized showed endometrial edema
   suggestive of estrogenization. The uteri of four cheetahs (19\%) showed
   evidence of mild cystic endometrial hyperplasia. Paraovarian cysts were
   seen on ultrasound (n = 21) and laparoscopy (n = 26) in 16 (76.2\%) and
   18 (85.7\%) cheetahs, respectively. Ovarian volumes obtained from
   ultrasonographically determined dimensions predicted cyclic activity
   Laparoscopy showed that 19 ovaries had discernible follicular
   structures. In the study population, 10 (47.6\%) cheetahs were in
   proestrus or estrus; none in the luteal phase; and 11 (52.4\%) in
   anestrus. Transabdominal ultrasound, in combination with serum
   progesterone concentrations and vaginal cytology, was used with
   acceptable accuracy to assess cyclic ovarian activity in captive
   cheetahs. A considerable proportion of this aged population showed
   ovarian activity and the prevalence of paraovarian cysts was notable. A
   history of prior deslorelin treatment was not associated with either
   reproductive activity or uterine pathology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {{EUROPEAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{While there is ample evidence that income inequalities influence
   individuals' health status, the mechanisms behind this income
   inequality-health correlation are only partially understood. This study
   shows that inequalities evaluated on the basis of individual perceptions
   of injustice are a driving force behind this connection. Two main
   questions are addressed: Does perceiving one's earnings as unfair affect
   physical health? Do such perceptions contribute to structural health
   inequalities? The hypotheses presented are based on the effort-reward
   imbalance model, according to which experiencing injustice causes
   stress, which can have a negative effect on individual health. Analyses
   of large-scale longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel of
   the years 2005-2010 show that female employees who perceive their
   earnings as unjustly low display significantly worse physical health,
   and that if employees perceive their earnings to be unjust for an
   extended period, this contributes to the deterioration of individual
   physical health in male and female employees. Employees from lower
   social classes, in particular unskilled blue-collar workers, more
   frequently perceive their earnings to be unjust. Experience of unjust
   earnings mediates the relationship between social class and physical
   health, if to a limited extent. Our conclusion is that differential
   exposure to unjust earnings contributes to the emergence of structural
   health inequalities.}},

   Knowledge of the most common characteristic mechanisms by which cancer
   impacts the nervous system enables prompt diagnosis and appropriate

   Mass effect, status epilepticus, pituitary apoplexy, and metastatic
   epidural spinal cord compression are emergencies that arise from direct
   effects of central nervous system neoplasms. Limbic encephalitis may
   result in hospitalization and at times critical illness, and is usually
   caused by antibody-mediated reactions to neoplasms. Treatment-related
   neuro-oncologic emergencies from the effects of radiation and

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have shown continued structural and functional
   development in neural circuitry underlying social and emotional
   behaviour during adolescence. This article explores adolescent
   neurocognitive development in two domains: sensitivity to social
   rejection and Theory of Mind (ToM). Adolescents often report
   hypersensitivity to social rejection. The studies presented here suggest
   that this is accompanied by reduced responses in brain regions involved
   in emotion regulation. Studies on social rejection in adolescents with
   autism spectrum conditions will also be discussed. ToM is another social
   cognitive domain which undergoes neurocognitive development between
   adolescence and adulthood. ToM refers to the ability to understand
   others' thoughts and intentions. Neuroimaging data suggest that the
   ability to integrate emotional information into ToM decisions continues
   to develop between adolescence and adulthood. In sum, these studies
   demonstrate ongoing development of social and emotional cognition during
   adolescence at both behavioural and neural levels, providing a
   neurocognitive framework for understanding adolescent behaviour. (C)

Abstract = {{Acute viral hepatitis resulting due to hepatitis E viral infection
   (AVH-E) is often serious in pregnancy and could result in acute liver
   failure (ALF). The role of monocytes and macrophages (mono-macs) in the
   pathogenesis of AVH-E and development of ALF-E in pregnancy is unclear.
   We investigated the functions of mono-macs in pregnant (P), AVH-E (n =
   44), ALF-E (n = 12), healthy controls (HC; n = 20) and compared with
   nonpregnant (NP) AVHE (n = 10), ALF-E (n = 5), and HC (n = 10). We also
   recruited non-hepatitis E virus-related pregnant (P), ALF-NE (n = 5) and
   non-pregnant (NP), ALF-NE (n = 12) patients with ALF. Mono-macs,
   dendritic cell (DC) phenotypes, and Toll-like receptor (TLR) expressions
   were studied by flow cytometry and reverse-transcriptase polymerase
   chain reaction. Mono-macs functionality was determined by analyzing
   their phagocytic activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation
   by using flow cytometry. Frequency of mono-macs and DCs was increased
   during HEV infection compared to HC (P < 0.001). Macrophages were
   increased (P < 0.002) in ALF-E(P) compared to ALF-NE(P). The macrophage
   phagocytic activity and Escherichia coli-induced ROS production was
   significantly impaired in ALF-E(P) compared to AVH-E(P) (P < 0.001),
   ALF-E(NP), and ALF-NE(P) patients (P < 0.02). TLR3 and TLR9 expression
   and downstream MYD88 signalling molecules IRF3 and IRF7 were
   significantly down-regulated in ALF-E(P) (P < 0.00) compared to AVH-E(P)
   and ALF-NE(P). Conclusion: Functionality of mono-macs is impaired in
   pregnant ALF-E patients compared to AVH-E(P). Reduced TLR3 and TLR7
   expression and TLR downstream-signaling molecules in pregnant ALF-E
   patients suggests inadequate triggers for the innate immune responses
   contributing to development and severity of ALF-E. Studies using TLR
   agonists to activate mono-macs may be of use and in vitro studies should
   be undertaken using patient samples.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To evaluate the potential role, efficacy, and complications of
   endovascular management of postpartum hemorrhage induced by variable
   placental abnormalities.
   Materials and methods: Ten patients with placental abnormalities
   underwent pelvic arterial embolization in Assiut University Hospital,
   because of postpartum hemorrhage. Placental abnormalities were; retained
   placenta (n = 4), placenta accrete vera (n = 1), placenta increta (n =
   2), placenta percreta (n = 1), and choriocarcinoma (n = 2). Only three
   patients were embolized on emergency bases, while the other 7 patients
   were scheduled for embolization.
   Results: The mean hemoglobin level before embolization was 6 g/dL
   (range: 4.5-8 g/dL). Severe coagulation disorders were present in one
   patient. Postembolization pelvic angiogram showed total
   devascularization of the pathological arteries in 7(70\%) patients, and
   subtotal devascularization in 3(30\%) patients. The clinical success is
   100\%.
   Conclusion: Whatever the placental disease, pelvic embolization with
   long-lasting embolizing agents is very effective and safe treatment of
   associated postpartum hemorrhage. (C) 2015 The Authors. The Egyptian

Abstract = {{No one did more to draw neuroscientists' attention to the problem of
   consciousness in the twentieth century than Francis Crick, who may be
   better known as the co-discoverer (with James Watson) of the structure
   of DNA. Crick focused his research on visual awareness and based his
   analysis on the progress made over the last fifty years in uncovering
   the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception. Because much of what
   happens in our brains occurs below the level of consciousness and many
   of our intuitions about unconscious processing are misleading,
   consciousness remains an elusive problem. In the end, when all of the
   brain mechanisms that underlie consciousness have been identified, will
   we still be asking: What is consciousness? Or will the question shift,
   just as the question What is life? is no longer the same as it was

Abstract = {{RelB is activated by the non-canonical NF-kappa B pathway, which is
   crucial for immunity by establishing lymphoid organogenesis and B-cell
   and dendritic cell (DC) maturation. To elucidate the mechanism of the
   RelB-mediated immune cell maturation, a precise understanding of the
   relationship between cell maturation and RelB expression and activation
   at the single-cell level is required. Therefore, we generated knock-in
   mice expressing a fusion protein between RelB and fluorescent protein
   (RelB-Venus) from the Relb locus. The Relb(Venus/Venus) mice developed
   without any abnormalities observed in the Relb(-/-) mice, allowing us to
   monitor RelB-Venus expression and nuclear localization as RelB
   expression and activation. Relb(Venus/Venus) DC analyses revealed that
   DCs consist of RelB(-), RelB(low) and RelB(high) populations. The
   RelB(high) population, which included mature DCs with projections,
   displayed RelB nuclear localization, whereas RelB in the RelB(low)
   population was in the cytoplasm. Although both the RelB(low) and RelB(-)
   populations barely showed projections, MHC II and co-stimulatory
   molecule expression were higher in the RelB(low) than in the RelB(-)
   splenic conventional DCs. Taken together, our results identify the
   RelB(low) population as a possible novel intermediate maturation stage
   of cDCs and the Relb(Venus/Venus) mice as a useful tool to analyse the
   dynamic regulation of the non-canonical NF-kappa B pathway.}},

Title = {{Conventional and high-dose daunorubicin and idarubicin in acute myeloid
   leukaemia remission induction treatment: a mixed treatment comparison
   meta-analysis of 7258 patients}},

Abstract = {{Previous meta-analyses suggested that acute myeloid leukaemia induction
   regimens containing idarubicin (IDA) or high-dose daunorubicin (HDD)
   induce higher rates of complete remission (CR) than conventional-dose
   daunorubicin (CDD), with a possible benefit in overall survival.
   However, robust comparisons between these regimens are still lacking. We
   conducted a mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis regarding these
   three regimens. Mixed treatment comparison is a statistical method of
   data summarization that aggregates data from both direct and indirect
   effect estimates. Literature search strategy included MEDLINE, EMBASE,
   Cochrane, Scielo and LILACS, from inception until August 2013 and
   resulted in the inclusion of 17 trials enrolling 7258 adult patients.
   HDD {[}relative risk (RR) 1.13; 95\% credible interval (CrI) 1.02-1.26]
   and IDA (RR 1.13; 95\% CrI 1.05-1.23) showed higher CR rates than CDD.
   IDA also led to lower long-term overall mortality rates when compared
   with CDD (RR 0.93, 95\% CrI 0.86-0.99), whereas HDD and CDD were no
   different (RR 0.94, 95\% CrI 0.85-1.02). HDD and IDA comparison did not
   reach statistically significant differences in CR (RR 1.00; 95\% CrI
   0.89-1.11) and in long-term mortality (RR 1.01, 95\% CrI 0.91-1.11). IDA
   and HDD are consistently superior to CDD in inducing CR, and IDA was
   associated with lower long-term mortality. On the basis of these
   findings, we recommend incorporation of IDA and HDD instead of the
   traditional CDD as standard treatments for acute myeloid leukaemia
   induction. The lack of HDD benefit on mortality, when compared with CDD
   in this study, should be cautiously addressed, because it may have been
   susceptible to underestimation because of statistical power limitations.

Abstract = {{The paper examines the power of corporate social responsibility to
   reduce information asymmetry and to act as a marketing instrument in the
   banking sector. Trust is the most important asset of a bank. Therefore,
   banks are motivated to use the most effective instruments to diminish
   information asymmetry with their stakeholders. The fact that cash
   disbursements in CSR actions are not directed towards shareholders makes
   them more valuable signals to other stakeholders regarding the financial
   soundness of the bank. The empirical study conducted based on limited
   dependent variable models supports the effectiveness of the CSR as
   marketing instrument in banking. It reveals the circumstances associated
   to a higher probability of an active CSR policy conducted by a banking
   institution. The results support the hypothesis that in the banking
   sector CSR is perceived as an instrument which helps stakeholders reduce
   information asymmetry. As marketing instrument, CSR contributes to
   increasing the tangibility of the banking products, decreasing their
   perceived variability and thus making them more attractive for the
   clients and allowing for differentiation between competitors.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Numerous research and clinical interventions, such as targeting drug
   deliveries or surgeries and finding blood clots, abscesses, or lesions,
   require accurate localization of various body parts. Individual
   differences in anatomy make it hard to use typical stereotactic
   procedures that rely on external landmarks and standardized atlases. For
   instance, it is not unusual to incorrectly place a craniotomy in brain
   surgery. This project was thus performed to find a new and easy method
   to correctly establish the relationship between external landmarks and
   medical scans of internal organs, such as specific regions of the brain.
   Methods: This paper introduces an MRI, CT, and radiographically visible
   compound that can be applied to any surface and therefore provide an
   external reference point to an internal (eye-invisible) structure.
   Results: Tested on nonhuman primates and isolated brain scans, this
   compound showed up with the same color in different scan types, making
   practical work possible. Conventional, and mostly of specific utility,
   products such as contrast agents were differentially colored or
   completely failed to show up and were not flexible. Conclusion: This
   compound can be customized to have different viscosities, colors, odors,
   and other characteristics. It can also be mixed with hardening materials
   such as acrylic for industrial or engineering uses, for example.
   Laparoscopy wands, electroencephalogram leads, and other equipment could
   also be embedded with or surrounded by the compound for ease in
   3-dimensional visualizations. A pending U.S. patent endorses this
   invention.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing provides reliable, affordable, and flexible resources
   for many applications and users with constrained computing resources and
   capabilities. The cloud computing concept is becoming an appealing
   paradigm for many industries including the gaming industry, leading to
   the introduction of cloud gaming architectures. Despite its advantages,
   cloud gaming suffers from unguaranteed end-to-end delay as well as
   server side's computational complexity. In this paper, a novel algorithm
   for reducing the computational complexity and hence speeding up the
   video encoding speed is proposed. Specifically, by performing minimum
   modifications in the game engine and the video codec, some information
   from the game engine is fed into the video encoder to bypass the motion
   estimation (ME) process. Our results show that the proposed method
   achieves up to 39\% speedup in the ME process, leading to a 24\%
   acceleration in the total encoding process.}},

Abstract = {{Macrophages, a significant component of atherosclerotic plaques
   vulnerable to acute complications, can be pro-inflammatory (designated
   M1), regulatory (M2), lipid- (Mox) or Heme-induced (Mhem). We showed
   previously that low (LSS) and oscillatory (OSS) shear stress cause
   thin-cap fibroatheroma and stable smooth muscle cell-rich plaque
   formation respectively in ApoE-knockout (ApoE(-/-)) mice. Here we
   investigated whether different shear stress conditions relate to
   specific changes in macrophage polarization and plaque morphology by
   applying a shear stress-altering cast to the carotid arteries of high
   fat-fed ApoE(-/-) mice. The M1 markers iNOS and IRF5 were highly
   expressed in macrophage-rich areas of LSS lesions compared to OSS
   lesions 6 weeks after cast placement, while the M2 marker Arginase-1,
   and Mox/Mhem markers HO-1 and CD163 were elevated in OSS lesions. Our
   data indicates shear stress could be an important determinant of
   macrophage polarization in atherosclerosis, with low shear promoting M1
   programming. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Prevention of secondary infection is currently the main goal of
   treatment for acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Colon was considered as
   the main origin of secondary infection. Our aim was to investigate
   whether prophylactic total colectomy would reduce the rate of bacterial
   translocation and infection of pancreatic necrosis. Forty-two
   Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Pancreatitis was created by ductal
   infusion of sodium taurocholate. Rats were divided into four groups:
   group-1, laparotomy+ pancreatic ductal infusion of saline; group-2,
   laparotomy+pancreatic ductal infusion of sodium taurocholate; group-3,
   total colectomy+pancreatic ductal infusion of saline; and group-4, total
   colectomy+pancreatic ductal infusion of sodium taurocholate. Forty-eight
   hours later, tissue and blood samples were collected for microbiological
   and histopathological analysis. Total colectomy caused small bowel
   bacterial overgrowth with gram-negative and gram-positive
   microorganisms. Bacterial count of gram-negative rods in the small
   intestine and pancreatic tissue in rats with colectomy and acute
   pancreatitis were significantly higher than in rats with acute
   pancreatitis only (group-2 versus group-4; small bowel, p=<0.001;
   pancreas, p=0.002). Significant correlation was found between proximal
   small bowel bacterial overgrowth and pancreatic infection (r=0,836,
   p=0.001). In acute pancreatitis, prophylactic total colectomy (which can
   mimic colonic cleansing and reduction of colonic flora) induces small
   bowel bacterial overgrowth, which is associated with increased bacterial
   translocation to the pancreas.}},

Abstract = {{Background The prevalence rate of HIV among blood donors differs between
   countries and regions. The aim of this study was to determine the
   prevalence of HIV among blood donors in the Blood Bank of Beni-Suef
   University Hospital, Egypt, during the 5 years 2010-2014.
   Materials and methods This is a retrospective, record-based study that
   involved the abstraction of data of all donors from registers at the
   Beni-Suef University Hospital Blood Bank during the period 2010-2014.
   Data were transformed onto data sheets and entered into a computer
   database.
   Results Of the 26 442 blood donors, 24733 (93.5\%) were male and 1709
   (6.5\%) were female. The mean age for the whole group was 29.88 +/- 7.6
   (range = 18-65) years. The prevalence of HIV was 0.1\% (14 donors); of
   them, there were 13 (92.9\%) male donors and one (7.1\%) female donor,
   but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.9). More
   than 50\% (57.1\%) of HIV-positive patients (8/14) were between 20 and
   29 years of age and four (28.6\%) were between 30 and 39 years of age,
   with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.08). There were
   HIV-HCV coinfections in two donors (14.3\%) (P = 0.5). The highest
   percentage (35.7\%) of HIV-positive donors (five donors) were of blood
   group B, with no significant difference (P = 0.2).
   Conclusion and recommendations The prevalence of HIV was low (0.1\%)
   among blood donors in Beni-Suef, Egypt, with no significant differences
   for age or sex. The incidence of HIV-HCV coinfection was 14.3\%. We
   recommend strengthening of the healthcare system by improving the
   screening facilities for HIV and other transfusion-transmissible
   infections.}},

Title = {{RETHINKING CHUTES: INCENTIVES, INVESTMENT, AND INNOVATION}},
Journal = {{BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW}},

Volume = {{95}},

Abstract = {{Eighty-two percent of public firms have golden parachutes (or ``chutes')
   under which CEOs and senior officers may be paid tens of millions of
   dollars upon their employer's change in control. What justifies such
   extraordinary payouts?
   Much of the conventional analysis views chutes as excessive compensation
   granted by captured boards, focusing on the payouts that occur following
   a takeover. Those explanations, if they ever were complete, miss the
   mark today. This Article demonstrates, theoretically and empirically,
   that chutes are less relevant to a firm during a takeover than they are
   before a takeover, particularly in relation to firms that invest in
   innovation. Chutes assure managers of realizing the long-term value of
   their work, even if the firm is later acquired. As a result, managers
   are more likely to make specific investments in innovation whose value
   may not be realized for some time but which are essential to sustaining
   long-term performance. Moreover, when granted, a chute's expected cost
   is a small fraction of what may be paid, reflecting the real likelihood
   a payment will never be made. That cost is more than offset by the value
   of the specific investments in innovation that managers are now more
   likely to make. Consequently, granting chutes tends to increase the
   value of innovative firms promoting, rather than jeopardizing,
   shareholder interests in such firms.
   Nevertheless, an analysis of chutes as a valuable tool in promoting
   innovation is largely missing from the corporate law scholarship, with
   important consequences. Two, in particular, are the negative view of
   proxy advisors on chutes, and recent federal Say-on-Golden-Parachute
   legislation that mandates certain types of disclosure regarding chutes.
   We recommend changes that properly reflect the low expected cost of
   chutes and their positive effect on innovation.}},

Title = {{Polymerase zeta Activity Is Linked to Replication Timing in Humans:
   Evidence from Mutational Signatures}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Replication timing is an important determinant of germline mutation
   patterns, with a higher rate of point mutations in late replicating
   regions. Mechanisms underlying this association remain elusive. One of
   the suggested explanations is the activity of error-prone DNA
   polymerases in late-replicating regions. Polymerase zeta (pol zeta), an
   essential error-prone polymerase biased toward transversions, also has a
   tendency to produce dinucleotide mutations (DNMs), complex mutational
   events that simultaneously affect two adjacent nucleotides. Experimental
   studies have shown that pol zeta is strongly biased toward GC -> AA/TT
   DNMs. Using primate divergence data, we show that the GC -> AA/TT pol
   zeta mutational signature is the most frequent among DNMs, and its rate
   exceeds the mean rate of other DNM types by a factor of approximately
   10. Unlike the overall rate of DNMs, the pol zeta signature drastically
   increases with the replication time in the human genome. Finally, the
   pol zeta signature is enriched in transcribed regions, and there is a
   strong prevalence of GC -> TT over GC -> AA DNMs on the nontemplate
   strand, indicating association with transcription. A recurrently
   occurring GC -> TT DNM in HRAS and SOD1 genes causes the Costello
   syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis correspondently; we observe
   an approximately 1 kb long mutation hotspot enriched by transversions
   near these DNMs in both cases, suggesting a link between these diseases
   and pol zeta activity. This study uncovers the genomic preferences of
   pol zeta, shedding light on a novel cause of mutational heterogeneity
   along the genome.}},

Abstract = {{Solar plants based on single-stage conversion photovoltaic (PV)
   inverters (no dc-dc boost stage) have gained popularity due to their
   simplicity, high efficiency, and cost effectiveness. Existing PV plants
   mostly operate under 1000 V and are subject to wide dc-bus voltage
   variations due to the effect of PV cell temperature and the voltage of
   the maximum power point (well below the open-circuit voltage). In
   particular, attractive locations, such as U.S.-Canada mountain and
   central regions, are subject to extreme PV surface temperatures, making
   the dc-bus voltage variation a challenge for single-stage solar
   inverters. This paper investigates 1500 V solar inverters with a focus
   on dc-bus voltage range extension capabilities through novel modulation
   and power devices utilization. A comparative analysis with the existing
   1000 V solar inverters is presented to illustrate the significant
   advantages of the wide dc-bus range in 1500 V systems. A lower voltage
   limit in the dc-bus is achieved by employing a novel voltage reactive
   power dc-bus control strategy and modified modulation. A higher dc-bus
   peak voltage is obtained by maximizing the use of power switches. As a
   result, the 1500 V inverter dc-bus voltage is significantly extended to
   capture energy under extreme PV surface temperatures, greatly improving
   the limited range of traditional 1000 V inverters. Simulations and
   experimental results using a three-phase three-level neutral
   point-clamped inverter level are presented to validate the proposed
   dc-bus extension range, control strategy, and modulation scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Lyme disease is the United States' most significant vector-borne
   illness. Virginia, on the southern edge of the disease's currently
   expanding range, has experienced an increase in Lyme disease both
   spatially and temporally, with steadily increasing rates over the past
   decade and disease spread from the northern to the southwestern part of
   the state. This study used a Geographic Information System and a spatial
   Poisson regression model to examine correlations between demographic and
   land cover variables, and human Lyme disease from 2006 to 2010 in
   Virginia. Analysis indicated that herbaceous land cover is positively
   correlated with Lyme disease incidence rates. Areas with greater
   interspersion between herbaceous and forested land were also positively
   correlated with incidence rates. In addition, income and age were
   positively correlated with incidence rates. Levels of development,
   interspersion of herbaceous and developed land, and population density
   were negatively correlated with incidence rates. Abundance of forest
   fragments less than 2 hectares in area was not significantly correlated.
   Our results support some findings of previous studies on ecological
   variables and Lyme disease in endemic areas, but other results have not
   been found in previous studies, highlighting the potential contribution
   of new variables as Lyme disease continues to emerge southward.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyses women's roles in the learning process that
   accompanies the switch towards multi-functionality and multifunctional
   entrepreneurship: the process by which farmers gain the necessary
   knowledge and skills `to do multifunctionality', develop and adapt their
   identity as `multifunctional entrepreneurs', and re-establish the
   identity of the farm as a multifunctional one. Detailed inspection of
   men's and women's positions and functions in the learning process
   reveals women's leading roles in: 1) introducing new identities and
   practices onto the farm, 2) providing access to new networks and
   learning environments, and 3) initiating negotiation within the farming
   family regarding the farm's (future) orientation towards primary
   production or multifunctionality. All three aspects of learning are
   essential building blocks for the development of multifunctional
   entrepreneurship on family farms. The paper is based on a study of 120
   Dutch multifunctional farms, with a detailed analysis of the
   genderedness of the entrepreneurial learning process in three specific

Abstract = {{Folk medicine and folk healing may be defined codified, regulated,
   taught openly and practised widely, and benefit from thousands of years
   of experience. On the other hand, it may be highly secretive, mystical
   and extremely localized, with knowledge of its practices passed on
   orally. Folk medicine and traditional medical practices emerged as a
   result of the reactions of primitive men against natural events and
   their ways of comparing and exchanging the medical practices of relevant
   communities with their own practices. Magic played an important role in
   shaping the practices. Folk medicine is the solutions developed by
   societies against material and moral disorders starting from the mythic
   period until today. Folk healer, on the other hand, is the wisest and
   the most respectable person in the society, in terms of materiality and
   morale. This person has the power of identifying and curing the
   diseases, disorders, consequently the origin of these diseases and
   disorders, and the skill of using various drugs for the treatment of the
   diseases and disorders or applying the practices with the help of
   information and practices acquired from the tradition.
   The Turks having rich and deep rooted culture. The Turkish folk medicine
   and folk healing that contain rich cultural structure in themselves
   survive until today by being fed by different sources. Before Islam, the
   Turks used to believe that there were white and black possessors,
   ancestors' spirits (arvaks) and their healthy and peaceful life depended
   on getting on with these spirits. They also believed that diseases were
   caused when they could no more keep in with possessors and spirits, or
   when they offended and annoyed them. In such an environment of belief,
   the visible diseases caused by material reasons were generally cured
   with products obtained from plants, mines and animals in the region or
   drugs that were made out of their combinations. On the other hand, in
   invisible diseases associated with spirits and possessors, on the other
   hand, the treatment was undertaken by kams and they removed the disorder
   with the help of practices called ``kamla-{''}, which involved various
   magics and bewitcheries. These features of kams occasionally coincide
   with the features of people known as ``ocak{''} or ``ocakli{''} in many
   regions of Anatolia. According to the information given by ocak/ocakli
   people whom we met in various regions, an ocak or ocakli person does not
   demand a certain fee after or before her/his practices and treatments;
   thus, there is no bargain between the patient and the ocakli.}},

Abstract = {{Predator-prey interactions were studied in natural experiments
   (windhounds pursuing wild saiga antelopes and brown hares in native
   landscapes). A lower pursuit success compared to that of wild predators
   was found. The prey of windhounds was represented by animals not only
   with various abnormalities in the internal organs and impaired
   conditions (see Communication 1), but also with an increased amount of
   microflora on the tested body surface fragments. Possible mechanisms of
   distant discrimination between the accessible and inaccessible objects
   of hunt that ensure the high selectivity of prey elimination are
   analyzed. Published and experimental data demonstrating the regulation
   of the amount of microflora by the physiological state of macroorganisms
   with different well-being levels are presented. Changes in the
   microflora are a consequence, but not the cause, of the reduced
   adaptation of the organism. The causes of such reduction are different,
   but their result is the development of the adrenal response, which
   modulates, in particular, the entire microbiota of the macroorganism.
   The transformation of the microbiota underlies the changes in the odour
   of potentially available prey, thus providing to predator the
   possibility of distant evaluation of the perspectives for pursuit and
   selection of prey by its fitness.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel and unique mobility support scheme for a
   color-clustered (CC) full-duplex multiuser (MU) bidirectional visible
   light communication (VLC) network is presented. Mobility is classified
   into two categories: intercluster and intracluster. In the proposed
   scheme, the mobility support is efficiently provided using a color
   filter array (CFA) at the downlink receiver. This CFA gives rise to
   receiver diversity in the form of selection combining yielding
   performance improvement. Simulations are conducted in terms of
   communication delay and frame loss rate relative to user speed and
   distance. In addition, the bit error rate (BER) performance and the data
   rate are analyzed in the CC MU VLC network. It is demonstrated that the
   proposed CFA and receiver diversity based mobility scheme in the CC MU
   VLC network offers superior performance in terms of BER and data rate in

Abstract = {{Aim Solution-culture experiments that test the response of As on Fe
   plaque quantity report an increase of Fe plaque with increasing As in
   solution due the plant's response to incipient As toxicity, i.e., a
   defense mechanism. The present study tests whether the differences in Fe
   plaque quantity can arise abiotically as a result of experimental
   design.
   Methods An O-2-delivery system simulating root-aerenchymal O-2 diffusion
   was used to investigate the abiotic effect of arsenite as well as
   silicate and phosphate on Fe plaque quantity and mineral composition in
   solution-culture experiments using deionized water or rice field water.
   Several approaches (DCB extractions, XRD, SEM, and EXAFS) were used to
   characterize the plaque.
   Results In the absence of ligands, a thin layer of plaque comprised of
   goethite/ferrihydrite formed, whereas plaque thickness and quantity
   increased 3-fold with solution As and was comprised of
   lepidocrocite/ferrihydrite. Plaque quantity also increased with Si or P
   but less so than As, and had different mineral composition. With rice
   field water, ferrihydrite formed and no difference in Fe plaque quantity
   was found with As.
   Conclusion Solution composition greatly impacts the quantity and mineral
   composition of Fe plaque in solution-culture experiments, and should be
   considered in the design of future Fe plaque induction experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The pyrolysis of six waste biomass samples was studied and the fuels
   were kinetically evaluated. A modified independent parallel reactions
   scheme (IPR) and a distributed activation energy model (DAEM) were
   developed and their validity was assessed and compared by checking their

   prediction capability in different experimental conditions. The
   pyrolysis experiments were carried out in a thermogravimetric analyzer
   and a fitting procedure, based on least squares minimization, was
   performed simultaneously at different experimental conditions. A
   modification of the IPR model, considering dependence of the
   pre-exponential factor on heating rate, was proved to give better fit
   results for the same number of tuned kinetic parameters, comparing to
   the known IPR model and very good prediction results for stepwise
   experiments. Fit of calculated data to the experimental ones using the
   developed DAEM model was also proved to be very good. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Traditional clustering algorithms often exhibit poor performance for
   large networks. On the contrary, greedy algorithms are found to be
   relatively efficient while uncovering functional modules from large
   biological networks. The quality of the clusters produced by these
   greedy techniques largely depends on the underlying heuristics employed.
   Different heuristics based on different attributes and properties
   perform differently in terms of the quality of the clusters produced.
   This motivates us to design new heuristics for clustering large
   networks. In this paper, we have proposed two new heuristics and
   analyzed the performance thereof after incorporating those with three
   different combinations in a recently celebrated greedy clustering
   algorithm named SPICi. We have extensively analyzed the effectiveness of
   these new variants. The results are found to be promising. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Ramelteon is the only FDA-approved melatonin agonist for treatment of
   insomnia. It acts on melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors. We describe a case
   of a patient who was prescribed ramelteon for insomnia disorder. Shortly
   after initiation of ramelteon, he described vivid nightmares leading to
   discontinuation of ramelteon. The nightmares ameliorated with ramelteon
   discontinuation. Ramelteon is well tolerated with a favorable
   side-effect profile. No documented cases of nightmares secondary to
   ramelteon use were found in the literature. The effects of ramelteon on
   rapid eye movement sleep, the stage of sleep where dreams occur, need to
   be further explored. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Trivalent lanthanide ions display fascinating optical properties.
   Therefore, the rare-earth complexes of terbium fumarate heptahydrate and
   GdTb fumarate heptahydrate were grown by using a single gel diffusion
   technique. The crystals were characterized by different physicochemical
   techniques of characterization. UV-Vis and photoluminescence
   spectrophotometric experiments were carried out to study the optical
   properties of the grown crystals. Under various excitations (339 nm, 350
   nm or 368 nm) the terbium fumarate complex emitted characteristic
   (4f-4f) green emission of Tb3+ (D-5(4)-F-7(J), J = 6, 5, 4 and 3,
   respectively). Luminescence spectra showed that Gd3+ ions in the mixed
   complex have not affected the luminescence emission peak positions, but
   remarkably increased the luminescent intensities of the terbium complex.
   The energy-transfer mechanism between the ligand and the central Tb3+
   ions and from the Gd3+ to the Tb3+ was discussed.}},

   target: How hard will it be to achieve?}},
Journal = {{ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{25-34}},

Abstract = {{The Australian government has recently pledged a reduction in GHGs
   emissions of 26-28\% below the 2005 level by 2030. How big is the
   challenge for the country to achieve this target in terms of its present
   emissions profile, recent historical trends, and the contributions to
   those trends from key proximate factors contributing to emissions? In
   this paper, we attempt a quantitative judgement of the challenge by
   using decomposition analysis. Based on the analysis it appears the
   announced target will be quite challenging to achieve if the average
   annual mitigating effects from economic restructuring, energy efficiency
   improvements and movement towards less emissions-intensive energy
   sources in evidence over 2002-2013 continued through to 2030; however,
   if the contribution from these mitigating sources in evidence over
   2006-2013 can be sustained, achievement of the target will be much less
   challenging. The challenge for government then will be to provide a
   policy framework to ensure the more pronounced beneficial impacts of the
   mitigating factors evidenced during 2006-2013 can be maintained over the
   years to 2030. (C) 2015 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

Abstract = {{We propose an optimization model based on vehicle travel patterns to
   capture public charging demand and select the locations of public
   charging stations to maximize the amount of vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT)
   being electrified. The formulated model is applied to Beijing, China as
   a case study using vehicle trajectory data of 11,880 taxis over a period
   of three weeks. The mathematical problem is formulated in GAMS modeling
   environment and Cplex optimizer is used to find the optimal solutions.
   Formulating mathematical model properly, input data transformation, and
   Cplex option adjustment are considered for accommodating large-scale
   data. We show that, compared to the 40 existing public charging
   stations, the 40 optimal ones selected by the model can increase
   electrified fleet VMT by 59\% and 88\% for slow and fast charging,
   respectively. Charging demand for the taxi fleet concentrates in the
   inner city. When the total number of charging stations increase, the
   locations of the optimal stations expand outward from the inner city.
   While more charging stations increase the electrified fleet VMT, the
   marginal gain diminishes quicldy regardless of charging speed. (C) 2015

Title = {{Datum Planes Based on a Constrained L-1 Norm}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper has two major goals. First, we present an algorithm for
   establishing planar datums suitable for a default in tolerancing
   standards. The algorithm is based on a constrained minimization search
   based on the L-1 (L1) norm after forming a convex surface from the
   original surface or sampled points. We prove that the problem reduces to
   a simple minimization search between the convex surface and its
   centroid. The data points in the discrete case do not need to have any
   corresponding weights provided with them, as appropriate weighting is
   part of the algorithm itself, thereby making the algorithm largely
   insensitive to nonuniformly sampled data points. Terse MATHEMATICA code
   is included for the reader. The code is sufficient for primary and
   secondary planar datum fitting as well as a 3-2-1 datum reference frame
   generation. The second goal of this paper is to compare this new method
   with several other possible means for establishing datum planes,
   ultimately showing several appealing characteristics of the proposed
   algorithm. Since both the International Organization for Standardization
   (ISO) and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)
   standardization efforts are actively working to establish datum plane
   definitions, the timing of such a study is opportune.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We explored whether individuals' comparison of themselves to
   their social contacts, specifically feeling fitter or thinner than
   friends, is a significant predictor of three weight-loss behaviors
   (dieting, reducing alcohol, exercising).
   Methods: We used a longitudinal survey of a national sample of Americans
   (N = 20,373) to measure respondents' personal social networks and their
   self-comparisons to their social contacts at two annual waves.
   Results: Participants who felt thinner than friends in Wave 1 had 1.16
   lower odds of dieting in Wave 2. Those who felt fitter than friends in
   Wave 1 had 1.10 times higher odds of reducing alcohol and 1.18 times
   higher odds of exercising in Wave 2. We found that 20\% of the
   relationship between feeling thin at baseline and subsequent dieting may
   be because feeling heavier than friends makes one want to lose weight.
   This same dynamic accounts for 25\% of the relationship between feeling
   fit and dieting and 12\% of the relationship between feeling thin and
   reducing alcohol.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that normative self-comparison with
   important others is a potentially salient determinant of obesity-related

Abstract = {{Rotational atherectomy with the use of the Jet Stream XC device is
   indicated for treatment of infrainguinal arterial obstructive disease.
   The number of blades-up (BU) runs needed for optimal tissue debulking in
   femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis (ISR) is unknown. In the present
   series, 6 patients (15 lesions) were treated for femoropopliteal ISR
   with the Jet Stream XC device. Minimal luminal diameter or percent
   stenosis improved significantly from baseline after 2 BU runs, but no
   further gain was seen between 2 and 4 BU runs (P > .05). However,
   adjunctive balloon angioplasty reduced percent stenosis significantly
   following BU runs. In conclusion, the Jet Stream XC device achieved
   optimal acute angiographic results in treating femoropopliteal ISR
   following 2 BU runs and adjunctive balloon angioplasty.}},

Abstract = {{A kind of Eu2+ and Dy3+ co-doped strontium aluminate green long-lasting
   phosphor was synthesized via a coprecipitation synthesis method assisted
   by microwave irradiation in a weak reductive atmosphere of active
   carbon. The synthesis conditions were optimized with orthogonal
   experiments and the optimum technological parameters were obtained.
   Subsequently, the crystal structure, morphology and optical property of
   the composites were characterized. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
   illustrated that the samples were composed of single-phase SrAl2O4.
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the resultant
   nanoparticles had well-dispersed distribution and flake-like morphology
   with an average size of about 500 nm in width and 70 nm in thickness.
   The excitation and emission spectra indicated that excitation broadband
   chiefly lied in the ultraviolet range and naocrystalline particles
   emitted strong light at 508 nm corresponding to the typical
   characteristic 511-4f transition of Eu2+ ion under around 325 nm
   excitation. And the long afterglow photoluminescence of
   SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+ was observed in the dark with the naked eye after the
   removal of the excitation light. Furthermore, the microwave method
   requires a very short heating-time and the energy consumption. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Largely because water resource planning in the U.S. has been separated
   from land-use planning, opportunities for explicitly linking planning
   policies to water availability remain unexamined. The pressing need for
   better coordination between land-use planning and water management is
   amplified by changes in the global climate, which will place even
   greater importance on managing water supplies and demands than in the
   past. By surveying land and water managers in two urbanizing regions of
   the western United StatesPortland, Oregon and Phoenix Arizonawe assessed
   the extent to which their perspectives regarding municipal water
   resource management align or differ. We specifically focus on
   characterizing how they perceive water scarcity problems (i.e.,
   stressors) and solutions (i.e., strategies). Overall, the results show a
   general agreement across both regions and professions that long-term
   drought, population growth, and outdoor water use are the most important
   stressors to urban water systems. The results of the survey indicated
   more agreement across cities than across professions with regard to
   effective strategies, reinforcing the idea that land-use planners and
   water managers remain divided in their conception of the solutions to
   urban water management. To conclude, we recommend potential pathways for
   coordinating the fields of land and water management for urban
   sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are recognized as
   one of the promising nanomaterials for applications in various field of
   nanomedicine such as targeted imaging/drug delivery, tissue engineering,
   hyperthermia, and gene therapy. Besides their suitable biocompatibility,
   SPIONs' unique magnetic properties make them an outstanding candidate
   for theranostic nanomedicine. Very recent progress in the field revealed
   that the presence of external magnetic fields may cause considerable
   amount of SPIONs' agglomeration in their colloidal suspension. As
   variation of physicochemical properties of colloidal nanoparticles has
   strong effect on their biological outcomes, one can expect that the
   SPIONs' agglomeration in the presence of external magnetic fields could
   change their well-recognized biological impacts. In this case, here, we
   probed the cellular uptake and toxicity of the SPIONs before and after
   exposure to external magnetic fields. We found that the external
   magnetic fields can affect the biological outcome of magnetic
   nanoparticles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{Bamboo is a composite material reinforced axially by fibers called
   vascular bundles. In this paper, the mechanical stripping method was
   used to isolate vascular bundles from moso bamboo (Phyllostachys
   edulis), China's most important commercial bamboo species. The paper
   focuses on analyzing the suitability of this method for measuring the
   mechanical properties of single vascular bundles with respect to their
   location within a bamboo culm. Using a confocal laser scanning
   microscope (CLSM) and video extensometry testing technique, we found
   that the tensile mechanical properties of vascular bundle can be
   determined with great accuracy. The method relies on mechanical
   stripping to prepare samples at a length scale from individual bamboo,
   which traditionally increases the difficulty of conducting tests.
   Therefore, to determine the elastic modulus of vascular bundle material,
   video extensometry was used for efficient strain detection in tensile
   experiments. This type of sample preparation minimizes the usual
   problems encountered when mounting samples. The cross-sectional area of
   the vascular bundle was determined by CLSM measurement using an
   ultramicrotome as a cutting tool. Applying this method, the elastic
   modulus and tensile strength of the vascular bundle of moso bamboo were
   measured to be similar to 44.67 GPa and similar to 709.96 MPa,
   respectively. It is noteworthy that the tensile mechanical properties of
   the fibrous sheath areas are higher than those observed over the whole
   area.}},

Abstract = {{We report the synthesis of two new amphiphilic conjugates 1 and 2 based
   on naphthalene di- and monoimide chromophores and the investigation of
   their photophysical, self-assembly and DNA-binding properties. These
   conjugates showed aqueous good solubility and exhibited strong
   interactions with DNA and polynucleotides such as poly(dG center dot
   dC)-poly(dG center dot dC) and poly(dA center dot dT)-poly(dA center dot
   dT). The interaction of these conjugates with DNA was evaluated by
   photo-and biophysical techniques. These studies revealed that the
   conjugates interact with DNA through intercalation with association
   constants in the order of 5-8 x 10(4) m(-1). Of these two conjugates,
   bolaamphiphile 1 exhibited a supramolecular assembly that formed
   vesicles with an approximate diameter of 220 nm in the aqueous medium at
   a critical aggregation concentration of 0.4 mm, which was confirmed by
   SEM and TEM. These vesicular structures showed a strong affinity for
   hydrophobic molecules such as Nile red through encapsulation. Uniquely,
   when exposed to DNA the vesicles disassembled, and therefore this
   transformation could be utilised for the encapsulation and release of
   hydrophobic molecules by employing DNA as a stimulus.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) can provide safety and nonsafety
   applications to improve passenger safety and comfort. Grouping vehicles
   into platoons in VANETs can improve road safety and reduce fuel
   consumption. It is critical to design an efficient medium access control
   (MAC) protocol for platoon-based VANETs. Moreover, because of the space
   and time dynamics of moving vehicles, network connectivity is an
   important performance metric to indicate the quality of the network
   communications and the satisfaction of users. Unfortunately, network
   connectivity is often ignored in the design of existing MAC protocols
   for VANETs. In this paper, we study the connectivity characteristics and
   present a connectivity-aware MAC protocol for platoon-based VANETs. The
   connectivity probabilities are analyzed for vehicle-to-vehicle and
   vehicle-to-infrastructure communication scenarios in one-and two-way
   VANETs, respectively. A multipriority Markov model is presented to
   derive the relationship between connectivity probability and system
   throughput. Based on variable traffic status and network connectivity, a
   multi-channel reservation scheme is adopted to dynamically adjust the
   length of the control channel interval and the service channel interval
   for the improvement of the system throughput. Analysis and simulation
   results show that the throughput increases with connectivity
   probability. However, with a further increase in connectivity
   probability, the throughput will decrease due to numerous channel
   contentions.}},

Abstract = {{Conflict among couples was examined following a transition to parenthood
   intervention to determine both short-term efficacy of the program and
   elucidate the process of change postintervention. A randomized clinical
   trial design was used to examine conflict in couples who participated in
   a transition to parenthood psycho-educational workshop compared with
   controls. The beginnings of improved communication in conflict were
   evident at 3 months postbirth through decreased husband contempt and
   increased husband positive affect during conflict in a sample that
   demonstrated more substantial improvement at 1 year postintervention.
   Increases in husband positive affect in the workshop group at 3 months
   postbirth predicted more positive and less negative wife affect during
   conflict at 1 year postbirth. Results suggest that some indicators of
   intervention efficacy were evident, postintervention change can be
   gradual, husbands may be more receptive to implementing change shortly
   after birth, and early changes can be associated with later positive
   outcomes. Findings have implications for preparing couples for the
   gradual and complex nature of change associated with intervention.

Abstract = {{Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major causes of death worldwide.
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the leading causative agent of TB, is
   responsible for the morbidity and mortality of a large population
   worldwide. In view of above and as a part of our effort to develop new
   and potent anti-TB agents, a series of substituted naphthoquinone
   derivatives were subjected to molecular modeling using various feature
   selection methods. The statistically significant best 2D-QSAR model
   having correlation coefficient r(2) = 0.8643 and cross-validated squared
   correlation coefficient q(2) = 0.7138 with external predictive ability
   of pred r(2) = 0.7420 was developed by SA-PLS, and group-based QSAR
   model having r(2) = 0.7964 and q(2) = 0.7550 with pred r(2) = 0.7293 was
   developed by SA-PLS. Further analysis using three-dimensional QSAR
   technique identifies a suitable model obtained by SA-partial least
   square method leading to antitubercular activity prediction. k-nearest
   neighbor molecular field analysis was used to construct the best 3D-QSAR
   model using SA-PLS method, showing good correlative and predictive
   capabilities in terms of q(2) = 0.7863 and pred r(2) = 0.7396. The
   pharmacophore analysis results obtained from this study show that the
   distance between the aromatic/hydrophobic and the naphthoquinone moiety
   sites to the aliphatic and acceptor groups should be connected with
   almost the same distance for significant antitubercular activity. The
   information rendered by QSAR models may lead to a better understanding
   of structural requirements of antitubercular activity and also can help
   in the design of novel potent antitubercular activity.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of systemic infliximab for the
   induction of remission in patients with retinal vasculitis, inadequately
   responsive to other immunomodulatory therapy, based on fluorescein
   angiography grading for retinal vasculitis evaluation.
   Methods: We analyzed 60 patients with retinal vasculitis, from the
   Massachusetts Eye Research and Surgery Institution in Cambridge, MA.
   Response to therapy was based on analysis of serial fluorescein
   angiography and fundus photography, including a baseline angiogram
   before initiation of infliximab.
   Results: Sixty patients received infliximab therapy between July 2007
   and July 2012 at Massachusetts Eye Research and Surgery Institution for
   a diagnosis of retinal vasculitis. All had previously showed a poor
   clinical response to other immunomodulatory regimens, or ceased therapy
   due to intolerable side effects. The initial dose of infliximab was 5
   mg/kg in all patients and remained at this dose for the extent of
   treatment in 57 (95\%) patients. At 6 months, 45 of 51 (88.23\%)
   patients were maintaining remission with therapy, 5 (9.8\%) were in
   partial remission, and 1 patient had failed. At 12 months, 39 of 39
   (100\%) patients were maintaining remission with therapy.
   Conclusion: Infliximab is effective for the treatment of recalcitrant
   noninfectious retinal vasculitis, refractory to conventional
   immunomodulatory therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Social support is proposed as a coping mechanism against anxiety and
   depression amongst older persons, but few data have examined how this
   occurs. This study assessed the contributions of two sub-components of
   social support as mediators against psychological distress-broadly
   defined as anxiety and depression. 1,560 men and 1,758 women from the
   Hunter Community Study (Australia) completed the Duke Social Support
   Scale and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. The Duke Social
   Support Scale examined the amount of social interaction and satisfaction
   with social interactions. Significant mediating effects of social
   support were found in the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale items
   measuring depression but not anxiety. Satisfaction with social support
   was a significant predictor of Kessler Psychological Distress Scale
   total score and Sadness items, but the amount of social support was not
   a predictor of stress. Social support may assist with symptoms of
   depression, i.e., specific sadness/depressed mood, but not necessarily
   with anxiety. Implications for policy and service delivery were
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We report an improved in vitro propagation protocol for Morinda
   citrifolia L. in the present communication using nodal segments as
   explants from a 4 year old plant. Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium was
   used to inoculate the sterilized explants. Under laboratory conditions,
   4.6 +/- 0.48 shoots were regenerated from the nodal meristem of an
   explant on the combination of MS medium fortified with 4.0 mg/L
   6-benzylaminopurine (BAP). Semi-solid (with agar) and liquid MS medium
   was used for the multiplication of shoots in vitro. Combined effect of
   BAP and kinetin in shoot multiplication was reported favorable in
   semi-solid (10.6 +/- 0.17 shoots per vessel) and liquid MS medium (11.4
   +/- 0.47 shoots per vessel). The shoots were rooted in vitro on
   half-strength agar-gelled MS medium supplemented with 1.0 mg/L indole-3
   butyric acid (IBA) and 44.30 roots per shoot were observed from the cut
   ends of the shoots. All the shoots were also rooted by ex vitro method
   and maximum 36.12 roots per shoot were induced by treating the shoots
   with 300 mg/L IBA for 5 min. The in vitro rooted and ex vitro treated
   plantlets were transferred to the soilrite containing paper cups for
   hardening in the greenhouse. The plantlets were shifted to nursery bags
   after 4 weeks. Finally the hardened plantlets were planted in the field
   with 100\% rate of survival under natural conditions. The ex vitro
   rooting was reported more advantageous than in vitro rooting in terms of
   cost, time and percent survival of plantlets. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1119-1126}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Phenology of plants, or the timing of life cycle events, is important
   for understanding plant ecology, forest dynamics, and plant-animal
   interactions. In tropical forests, studies that document epiphyte
   reproductive phenology are relatively few because of the challenges of
   tracking plants that live in the canopy. Phenological patterns for 279
   individuals of 7 epiphyte species were examined across 12 months in a
   tropical montane forest in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Epiphytes were
   located in one of two common tree species, Ficus tuerckheimii (Moraceae)
   or Ocotea tonduzii (Lauraceae). Flowering and fruiting (i.e., when ripe
   or unripe fruit is present on the plant) of study plants was recorded on
   monthly intervals, and phenology was examined as a function of the
   season at the study site (i.e., wet, transition, or dry season), and
   pollinator syndrome (bird-, or insect-pollinated) and seed dispersal
   syndrome (bird-, bat-, or wind-dispersed) of each plant. Though some
   epiphyte species flowered and fruited throughout the year, the majority
   showed significant seasonality in phenological events. Based on circular
   statistics, the timing of mean flowering of different epiphyte species
   varied, however, timing of mean fruiting for most species tended to
   occur during the wet season. Insect- and bird-pollinated species had
   peak flowering during the dry season and late wet season, respectively.
   Bird-dispersed fruits were present each month of the year with peaks
   from February to October and again in December. Wind-dispersed fruits
   were observed eight months of the year with a peak in the early wet
   season. The timing of epiphyte flowering coincided with flowering of
   large trees in the area. Epiphyte fruiting, however, is distinct from
   large tree fruiting. Our results demonstrate the seasonal nature of
   flowering and fruiting in individual epiphyte species while also
   highlighted the asynchronous nature of phenological events amongst the
   epiphyte community.}},

Journal = {{MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{52}},

Abstract = {{Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common type of thyroid
   neoplasias; however, primary thyroid gland lymphoma (PTL) is uncommon
   and their simultaneous occurrence is very rare.
   Herein, we reported a 25-year-old female patient with Hashimoto's
   thyroiditis (HT), who developed a small goiter with a palpable 1.2-cm
   nodule in the right lobe. A fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy revealed
   atypical follicular epithelial cells and lymphoid cells in a background
   of lymphocytic thyroiditis. A total thyroidectomy was performed. The
   pathology showed multicentric papillary thyroid carcinoma, concomitant
   thyroid mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, and
   Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Postoperatively, he received chemotherapy and
   radioactive iodine ablation treatment. Nowadays the thyroglobulin of the
   patient is undetectable, without recurrences at 2 years of follow-up.
   It is concluded that the PTC and MALT lymphoma can exist concomitantly,
   especially in patients with HT. For the diagnostic workup and optional
   management of this rare coexistence, a multidisciplinary approach and
   close surveillance are needed.}},

Abstract = {{The acquired p53 mutations are the most common genetic alterations in
   human cancers. Mutant p53 proteins tend to accumulate, augmenting their
   oncogenic potential. However, the mechanisms for mutant p53 accumulation
   are not known. Previous studies have shown that S100A4 interacts with
   wild-type p53. The present study marks the first time the effect of
   S100A4 on mutant p53 levels in gastric cancer MKN1 cells, which harbor
   mutant p53(V143A), and the functional consequences have been
   investigated. S100A4 interacted with mutant p53(V143A) in the cells, and
   S100A4 inhibition decreased mutant p53(V143A) levels, indicating that
   S100A4 promoted mutant p53 accumulation through their interaction. We
   also found that S100A4 inhibition altered the expression of the mutant
   p53(V143A) target genes {[}c-Myc and inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2)].
   Moreover, we demonstrated that S100A4 knockdown increased mutant
   p53-related autophagy and cell differentiation. In conclusion, our data
   suggest a novel mechanism for mutant p53(V143A) accumulation and add a
   new facet to the role of S100A4 in cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is an emerging computed imaging
   modality that exploits optical contrast and ultrasonic detection
   principles to form images of the absorbed optical energy density within
   tissue. When the imaging system employs conventional piezoelectric
   ultrasonic transducers, the ideal photoacoustic (PA) signals are
   degraded by the transducers' acousto-electric impulse responses (EIRs)
   during the measurement process. If unaccounted for, this can degrade the
   accuracy of the reconstructed image. In principle, the effect of the
   EIRs on the measured PA signals can be ameliorated via deconvolution;
   images can be reconstructed subsequently by application of a
   reconstruction method that assumes an idealized EIR. Alternatively, the
   effect of the EIR can be incorporated into an imaging model and
   implicitly compensated for during reconstruction. In either case, the
   efficacy of the correction can be limited by errors in the assumed EIRs.
   In this work, a joint optimization approach to PACT image reconstruction
   is proposed for mitigating errors in reconstructed images that are
   caused by use of an inaccurate EIR. The method exploits the bi-linear
   nature of the imaging model and seeks to refine the measured EIR during
   the process of reconstructing the sought-after absorbed optical energy
   density. Computer-simulation and experimental studies are conducted to
   investigate the numerical properties of the method and demonstrate its
   value for mitigating image distortions and enhancing the visibility of
   fine structures.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a green synthetic polymer which has many
   excellent properties useful for various applications. In this study, PLA
   scaffolds were fabricated at 2.0-6.0 MPa saturation pressures by using a
   solvent-free solid-state air gas foaming technique. Differential
   scanning calorimetry analysis was used to investigate the melting
   behavior and the mechanism of isothermal crystallization kinetics of
   these PLA scaffolds. Kinetics theories, such as Avrami analysis which
   was established for crystal growth studies of synthetic polymers, are
   for the first time utilized to investigate the air gas foamed scaffolds.
   Results showed that 6.0 MPa scaffolds had a 3D spherulitic crystal
   growth kinetics which is different from the raw PLA and 3.0 MPa foams.
   The experimental results also proved that two types of crystals:
   defective alpha' and stable alpha coexisted in the PLA foams, and the
   contents of these two crystals were varied at different isothermal
   crystallization temperatures. Compared with the raw PLA, the
   crystallinities of PLA foams increased slightly after isothermal
   crystallization. However, the air gas molecules also hindered the
   crystallization rates of PLA foams. In addition, single crystals or
   perfect large crystals with alpha-form can be produced at a high
   isothermal crystallization temperature, such as 110 A degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To identify factors associated with removal from the liver
   transplantation waitlist because of death, deterioration of condition,
   or exceeding Milan criteria in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
   (HCC), with emphasis on the role of locoregional therapy (LRT), defined
   as percutaneous thermal ablation and drug-eluting embolic
   chemoembolization, as bridge therapy.
   Materials and Methods: All patients listed for liver transplant at a
   single institution with exception points for HCC during 2004-2012 were
   evaluated. The most common cause of cirrhosis was hepatitis C (68\%;
   121/177). Seventy-one percent (125/177) of patients underwent liver
   transplantation, and 83\% (147/177) underwent at least 1 LRT procedure.
   Of the 52 patients who did not undergo liver transplantation, 31 (60\%)
   of livers were removed because of progression of HCC.
   Results: The likelihood of transplant was higher for patients who
   received LRT (odds ratio {[}OR], 2.9; confidence interval {[}Cl],
   2.2-7.2) and lower for patients with multifocal tumors (OR, 0.25; CI,
   0.12-0.52) and with larger tumors (OR, 0.94; CI, 0.90- 0.98). Time on
   the waitlist (OR, 0.99; CI, 0.99-1.0) was not found to correlate with
   removal. LRT increased the likelihood of liver transplantation,
   specifically for patients with prolonged wait times. Patients who
   demonstrated complete response (CR) to LRT on the first follow-up
   imaging study were more likely to undergo liver transplantation.
   Conclusions: LRT increased the likelihood of a patient with HCC
   achieving liver transplant, particularly in patients facing prolonged
   waiting times. CR after LRT significantly increased the likelihood of
   liver transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Necrotizing sialometaplasia is a rare, benign reactive necrotizing
   lesion, involving sites where salivary gland tissue is usually present.
   The importance of this lesion is that it mimics malignancy clinically
   leading to treatments ranging from conservative excision to total
   maxillectomy. Cytologically and histologically also the lesion is often
   confused with neoplasms. We present a case of a lady with a hard palatal
   swelling, which was non - ulcerative unlike typical cases of necrotizing
   sialometaplsia. FNAC features made us strongly suspect a low grade
   mucoepidermiod carcinoma, following which the swelling was excised.
   Histopathology came to the rescue, on which the final diagnosis of
   necrotizing sialometaplasia of the hard palate was made.
   Necrotizing siaometaplasia is often misdiagnosed by the inexperienced
   cytologist, with histopathological examination being confirmatory. We
   also emphasize the fact that lesions like necrotizing sialometaplasia
   need a high degree of suspicion along with clinical corelation before
   subjecting the patient to unnecessary surgical procedures.}},

Abstract = {{A novel adaptive surrogate modeling-based algorithm is proposed to solve
   the integrated scheduling and dynamic optimization problem for
   sequential batch processes. The integrated optimization problem is
   formulated as a large scale mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)
   problem. To overcome the computational challenge of solving the
   integrated MINLP problem, an efficient solution algorithm based on the
   bilevel structure of the integrated problem is proposed. Because
   processing times and costs of each batch are the only linking variables
   between the scheduling and dynamic optimization problems, surrogate
   models based on piece-wise linear functions are built for the dynamic
   optimization problems of each batch. These surrogate models are then
   updated adaptively, either by adding a new sampling point based on the
   solution of the previous iteration, or by doubling the upper bound of
   total processing time for the current surrogate model. The performance
   of the proposed method is demonstrated through the optimization of a
   multiproduct sequential batch process with seven units and up to five
   tasks. The results show that the proposed algorithm leads to a 31\%
   higher profit than the sequential method. The proposed method also
   outperforms the full space simultaneous method by reducing the
   computational time by more than four orders of magnitude and returning a
   9.59\% higher profit. (c) 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers}},

Abstract = {{We consider a dynamic environmental and marketing decision problem for
   natural service systems with environmental deterioration. Demand of the
   service is attracted by both the environmental quality and the marketing
   efforts, but customers also generate wastes that greatly degrade the
   environment As a result, the manager of the service system may decide to
   make a cleaning up effort to help the environment recover in addition to
   its self-healing capability. The manager's objective is to maximize the
   net present value of the total profit over a planning horizon by
   determining both the environmental and marketing efforts in each period.
   To show how the environment affects the operation, we characterize the
   monotonicity of optimal decisions w.r.t the environmental quality. To
   investigate operational impact on the environment, we present a complete
   characterization of the steady-state environmental quality, and prove
   the global convergence of the environmental quality in the long run. The
   convergence result implies that the environment may gradually degrade
   over time. A case study is presented to show what can be done to control
   the degradation. An interesting finding is that the steady-state
   environmental quality may improve even if the average amount of wastes
   produced per customer increases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The thermal contact can influence the output performance of
   thermoelectric generators. However, in some applications, the heat
   source cannot afford an enough heating area for thermal contact.
   Therefore, compact thermoelectric generators based on optimized thermal
   contact interface should be designed and developed. In this paper,
   three-dimensional thermal extensional structures are designed,
   simulated, implemented and tested to optimize the thermal contact
   interface of compact thermoelectric generators. The result indicates
   that the compact thermoelectric generators based on three-dimensional
   thermal extensional structures can reduce the requirement of thermal
   contact area and make the heat flow directionally transferred to
   thermoelectric modules along the three-dimensional structure. In only
   3600 mm(2) thermal contact area, the compact thermoelectric generators
   based on the threedimensional structure can generate 5.58 V and 829 mW

Abstract = {{Researchers have made productive use of Bandura's (1991) construct of
   moral disengagement (MD) to help explain why sport participants deviate
   from ethical ideals. In this study of intercollegiate athletes from
   diverse sports (N = 713), we examined MD in relation to other
   character-related variables: empathy, moral identity, moral
   attentiveness, and contesting orientations. We also examined whether
   moral attentiveness conforms to the pattern of ``bracketed morality{''}
   found in moral reasoning (Shields \& Bredemeier, 1995) and moral
   behavior (Kavussanu, Boardley, Sagar, \& Ring, 2013). Results indicated
   that MD correlated positively with perceptual moral attentiveness and
   war contesting orientation; MD correlated negatively with empathy, moral
   identity, reflective moral attentiveness, and partnership contesting
   orientation. Results of hierarchical regression demonstrated that
   gender, contesting orientations, moral identity, and one form of moral
   attentiveness were significant predictors of MD. Finally, sport
   participants were found to be less morally attentive in sport than in
   everyday life.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{With the aim of enhancing oil refining processes based on fluid
   catalytic cracking (FCC), the catalytic cracking of polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) was investigated using an FCC catalyst consisting of
   a rare earth ion exchanged USY zeolite. In these trials, model PAHs were
   dissolved in n-hexadecane and were fed into a fixed bed microactivity
   test reactor operating at 516 degrees C. Reaction product analysis
   indicated very little cracking of the 2-ring PAH over the FCC catalyst,
   while in contrast the 3-ring PAH was highly reactive, and was rapidly
   converted into monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 2-ring PAHs and coke.
   Tests using FCC catalysts with different rare earth loadings revealed
   that the loading amount has little effect on the conversion of the
   3-ring PAH. In addition, catalysts containing USY zeolites with
   comparable unit cell sizes, and thus having comparable hydrogen transfer
   activities, exhibited similar catalytic activities for 3-ring PAH
   conversion, even though they contained different amounts of the rare
   earth metal oxide. This result suggests that the hydrogen transfer
   reaction plays an important role in 3-ring PAH conversion and that the
   main effect of rare earth loading is to maintain the hydrogen transfer
   activity of the catalyst by stabilizing the USY zeolite against steam
   deactivation. In summary, this study successfully demonstrated a
   potential FCC process for converting PAHs into useful light fractions
   without the necessity of employing a pressurized hydrogen atmosphere.

Abstract = {{A series of cement paste and mortar specimens containing waste ceramic

   tests show that the waste ceramic insulator powder can be added by
   approximately 0.4 parts by weight in the powder materials of cement
   paste, and the waste ceramic insulator aggregate can be added by
   two-thirds by weight in the materials of mortar. The acid resistance was
   tested by immersing the specimens in 5\% sulfuric acid. The reaction
   layer formation of specimens is affected by the immersion time,
   temperature, and compounding ratio of the materials. The results show
   that adding the waste ceramic insulator controls the dilatability of the

Abstract = {{This paper describes an improved authentication method for mobile
   devices compared with commonly used authentication using characters
   (text passwords) and Personal Identification Number (PINs). The method
   introduced in this paper was developed to overcome the difficulty of
   remembering unfamiliar secrets such as a complex sequence of text
   characters while maintaining authentication strength. We introduce a new
   authentication approach, SmartPass, that works for both legacy systems
   and mobile devices. SmartPass is a web-based mobile interface that
   provides a method to use visual map location secrets, which are
   theorized to be easier to remember and use than passwords and remain
   difficult for an adversary to guess. We evaluate the security strength
   of such a map-based secret compared with traditional text password, PIN,
   and pattern secrets. This paper also seeks to evaluate user feedback as
   to the usability and memorability of this authentication method.

Abstract = {{Studies on friendships in online social networks involving geographic
   distance have so far relied on the city location provided in users'
   profiles. Consequently, most of the research on friendships has provided
   accuracy at the city level, at best, to designate a user's location.
   This study analyses a Twitter dataset because it provides the exact
   geographic distance between corresponding users. We start by introducing
   a strong definition of friend' on Twitter (i.e. a definition of
   bidirectional friendship), requiring bidirectional communication. Next,
   we utilize geo-tagged mentions delivered by users to determine their
   locations, where @username' is contained anywhere in the body of tweets.
   To provide analysis results, we first introduce a friend-counting
   algorithm. From the fact that Twitter users are likely to post
   consecutive tweets in the static mode, we also introduce a two-stage
   distance-estimation algorithm. As the first of our main contributions,
   we verify that the number of friends of a particular Twitter user
   follows a well-known power-law distribution (i.e. a Zipf's distribution
   or a Pareto distribution). Our study also provides the following newly
   discovered friendship degree related to the issue of space: the number
   of friends according to distance follows a double power-law (i.e. a
   double Pareto law) distribution, indicating that the probability of
   befriending a particular Twitter user is significantly reduced beyond a
   certain geographic distance between users, termed the separation point.
   Our analysis provides concrete evidence that Twitter can be a useful
   platform for assigning a more accurate scalar value to the degree of
   friendship between two users.}},

   following exposure to ionizing radiation}},
Journal = {{BONE}},

Volume = {{81}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{During spaceflight, astronauts will be exposed to a complex mixture of
   ionizing radiation that poses a risk to their health. Exposure of
   rodents to ionizing radiation on Earth causes bone loss and increases
   osteoclasts in cancellous tissue, but also may cause persistent damage
   to stem cells and osteoprogenitors. We hypothesized that ionizing
   radiation damages skeletal tissue despite a prolonged recovery period,
   and depletes the ability of cells in the osteoblast lineage to respond
   at a later time. The goal of the current study was to test if
   irradiation prevents bone accrual and bone formation induced by an
   anabolic mechanical stimulus. Tibial axial compression was used as an
   anabolic stimulus after irradiation with heavy ions. Mice (male,
   C57BL/6J, 16 weeks) were exposed to high atomic number, high energy
   (HZE) iron ions (Fe-56, 2 Gy, 600 MeV/ion) (IR, n = 5) or
   sham-irradiated (Sham, n = 5). In vivo axial loading was initiated 5
   months post-irradiation; right tibiae in anesthetized mice were
   subjected to an established protocol known to stimulate bone formation
   (cyclic 9N compressive pulse, 60 cycles/day, 3 day/wk for 4 weeks). In
   vivo data showed no difference due to irradiation in the apparent
   stiffness of the lower limb at the initiation of the axial loading
   regimen. Axial loading increased cancellous bone volume by microcomputed
   tomography and bone formation rate by histomorphometry in both sham and
   irradiated animals, with a main effect of axial loading determined by
   two-factor ANOVA with repeated measure. There were no effects of
   radiation in cancellous bone microarchitecture and indices of bone
   formation. At the tibia diaphysis, results also revealed a main effect
   of axial loading on structure. Furthermore, irradiation prevented axial
   loading-induced stimulation of bone formation rate at the periosteal
   surface of cortical tissue. In summary, axial loading stimulated the net
   accrual of cancellous and cortical mass and increased cancellous bone
   formation rate despite prior exposure to ionizing radiation, in this
   case, HZE particles. Our findings suggest that mechanical stimuli may
   prove an effective treatment to improve skeletal structure following
   exposure to ionizing radiation. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Background Links between environmental chemicals and human health have
   emerged, but the effects on hearing were less studied. Therefore, the
   aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships of
   different sets of environmental chemicals and the hearing conditions in
   a national and population-based setting.
   Methods Data was retrieved from the US National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Surveys, 2011-2012 including demographics, serum
   measurements, lifestyle factors, self-reported hearing conditions, and
   urinary environmental chemical concentrations. Chi-square test, t test,
   and survey-weighted logistic regression models were performed.
   Results Among the American adults aged 20-69 (n = 5560), 462 (8.3 \%)
   people reported their hearing condition as moderate trouble to deaf.
   They had higher levels of urinary hydrocarbons and polyfluorinated
   compounds but not heavy metals, phthalates, arsenic, pesticides,
   phenols, parabens, perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate concentrations.
   Also, 466 (10.0 \%) people had hearing difficulties during conversation.
   They had higher levels of urinary cobalt (odds ratio (OR) 1.27, 95 \%
   confidence interval (95\%CI) 1.00-1.63), molybdemum (OR 1.45, 95\%CI
   1.04-2.02), strontium (OR 1.56, 95\%CI 1.10-2.21), phthalates,
   perchlorate (OR 1.27, 95\%CI 1.05-1.54), nitrate (OR 1.60, 1.03-2.49)
   and thiocyanate (OR 1.22, 95\%CI 1.01-1.48) concentrations but not
   arsenic, pesticides, phenols, parabens, hydrocarbons, and

Abstract = {{We construct solutions of the 3 + 1 dimensional Faddeev-Skyrme model
   coupled to Einstein gravity. The solutions are static and asymptotically
   flat. They are characterized by a topological Hopf number. We
   investigate the dependence of the ADM masses of gravitating Hopfions on
   the gravitational coupling. When gravity is coupled to flat space
   solutions, a branch of gravitating Hopfion solutions arises and merges
   at a maximal value of the coupling constant with a second branch of
   solutions. This upper branch has no flat space limit. Instead, in the
   limit of a vanishing coupling constant, it connects to either the
   Bartnik-McKinnon or a generalized Bartnik-McKinnon solution. We further
   find that in the strong-coupling limit, there is no difference between
   the gravitating solitons of the Skyrme model and the Faddeev-Skyrme
   model.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the idea of order nature, Alexander(1) regards all the
   phenomena of universe in living structures and nonliving structures and
   takes the patterns of living structures in terms of total whole and
   strong centers. This theory is formed as 15 interrelated characters of
   strong centers(2).
   Regarding the opinions of Persian garden researchers, Persian garden is
   a cultural phenomenon interwoven with different natural elements and
   artifacts based on geometrical sets. The attention to the recognition of
   total whole and explanation of strong centers can bring about a new look
   at Persian garden.
   The question of the research is extent of generality of Alexander`s
   theory in Chaharbagh and selected gardens in Isfahan studied in analytic
   method with quality approach.
   The results of the research show that the features of living structures
   such as level of scale, strong centers, boundaries, alternating
   repetition, and etc. are adaptable with selected gardens of Isfahan
   relatively but their roles are not the same while Level of scale, strong
   centers, positive space, alternating repetition, echoes, boundaries and
   good shape play greater role in creating life. Chaharbagh is of greater
   life as a public space and the role of strong centers, contrast, not -
   seperation and roughness is seen to be greater.}},

Abstract = {{The viscous fingering instability of miscible displacements in the
   presence of permeability heterogeneity is studied. Shear-thinning fluids
   are successful to suppress this instability where the mobility ratio is
   high and/or the heterogeneity of the porous medium is adverse. The
   displacing fluid is considered a non-Newtonian fluid, and the
   shear-thinning characters of it have been modeled using the
   Carreau-Yasuda constitutive equation. Two different heterogeneity models
   are used in this simulation, one in which the permeability decreases in
   transverse direction exponentially and the other in which the
   permeability decreases and increases exponentially in longitudinal
   direction, separately. In particular, the role of permeability
   heterogeneities on the differences between Newtonian and non-Newtonian
   fluids is investigated through linear stability analysis and nonlinear
   simulation. In nonlinear simulations, using a spectral method based on
   the Hartley transforms, nonlinear finger interactions, mixing lengths,
   sweep efficiencies, and transversely average concentration are examined
   and compared in Newtonian and non-Newtonian displacements.}},

Abstract = {{Peirce's empiricism was not limited to the pragmatic maxim. Eventually,
   he conceived of philosophy as a set of empirical inquiries, metaphysical
   and normative. To support that idea, he had to show that we can observe
   more than it is usually assumed that we can observe. His long series of
   experimental studies of observation established the objectivity of what
   would otherwise be thought subjective. He showed that experience itself
   can be observed and that, once observed, it proves to have aspects modal
   and normative. In method and in aim, Peirce's philosophy presents an
   alternative to contemporary fashions in philosophy. Its aim was to
   establish facts, not to analyze concepts. This paper only sketches that
   program; its focus is the empirical grounds on which Peirce expanded
   empiricism.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, studies have focused more towards using biocompatible
   scaffolds and stem cells to augment or replace the abnormal bladder.
   But, due to the lack of biomaterials with appropriate thickness as a
   suitable scaffold for smooth muscle regeneration, several structural,
   mechanical, and biocompatibility problems are encountered. Therefore, we
   aimed to demonstrate whether human muscle-derived stem cells (h-MDSCs)
   seeded on multilayered polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber is an
   appropriate scaffold for bladder smooth muscle regeneration. h-MDSCs
   were seeded on a multilayered PCL/collagen nanofiber sheet and implanted
   in the bladder of a mucosa preserving partial cystectomy rat. From our
   findings, h-MDSCs seeded on multilayered PCL showed efficient cell
   seeding and proliferation. In addition, the histological and
   immunohistochemical analysis showed cell survival in between the
   multilayered nanofiber sheet, which led to smooth muscle cell
   regeneration with improved pro-angiogenesis in the regenerated region of
   the bladder. Therefore, h-MDSCs seeded nanofibers could be a promising
   tool in treating neurogenic bladder and related diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Soybean is among one of the most important commercial crops, which is

   focused on the problems associated with the cultivation and highlights
   the effect of various Soya plant foliar diseases on its yield. It has
   been presented a fully automatic disease detection and level estimation
   system which is based on color image sensing and processing. Various new
   parameters, namely Disease-Severity-Index (DSI), Infection-Per Region
   (IPR), and Disease-Level-Parameter (DLP) for measuring the disease
   severity level and level-classification have also been formulated and
   derived. The proposed method has been tested on a real database of Soya
   leaves collected between July 2012 and September 2012 and found to be at
   an excellent methodology for the purpose mentioned above.

Abstract = {{In many predator-prey models, delay has a destabilizing effect and
   induces oscillations; while in many competition models, delay does not
   induce oscillations. By analyzing a rather simple delayed intraguild
   predation model, which combines both the predator-prey relation and
   competition, we show that delay in intraguild predation models promotes
   very complex dynamics. The delay can induce stability switches
   exhibiting a destabilizing role as well as a stabilizing role. It is
   shown that three types of bistability are possible: one stable
   equilibrium coexists with another stable equilibrium (node-node
   bistability); one stable equilibrium coexists with a stable periodic
   solution (node-cycle bistability); one stable periodic solution coexists
   with another stable periodic solution (cycle-cycle bistability).
   Numerical simulations suggest that delay can also induce chaos in
   intraguild predation models.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Facial computed tomography (CT) is often performed in the
   emergency department as a part of the diagnostic workup for patients
   presenting with the signs and symptoms of dentoalveolar abscess (DA).
   This investigation evaluated the diagnostic yield of the facial CT and
   its effects on management change in patients suspected of DA.
   Furthermore, we assessed secondary consequences of routine facial CT use
   in this population by using turn-around time (TAT), cost, and radiation
   exposure as the key parameters.
   Material and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed records of suspected
   DA patients over a 5-year period, from June 2008 to June 2013. TAT was
   calculated for patients from the time the examination was ordered by the
   emergency department physician, to the time the report was finalized by
   the attending radiologist. Effective radiation dose for facial CT was
   calculated by multiplying dose length product by the standard conversion
   coefficient K (K = 0.0021 mSv/mGy x cm). CT cost was included for
   reference but was not analyzed extensively due to the lack of
   standardization of costs across the various institutions.
   Results: Our investigation consisted of 117 patients; 75 males of
   average age 41 (+/- 12) years and 42 females of average age 44 (+/- 17)
   years. Out of the total 117 patients that underwent CT for the suspicion
   of a simple DA, only a single individual (0.85\%) underwent a management
   change. Mean TAT of facial CT was 110 (+/- 63) minutes, and a median TAT
   was 87 (+/- 71) minutes. Average effective radiation dose for a facial
   CT was 2.4 (+/- 0.4) mSv. Approximate estimated cost of a contrast
   enhanced facial CT was \$ 253 and non-contrast facial CT was \$ 209.
   Conclusion: Our study shows that routine use of facial CT has a very
   limited diagnostic value in the workup of simple DA and rarely results
   in management change. The overall impact on patient management is
   miniscule in the context of prolonged TAT, radiation exposure, and
   adding to the rising medical costs.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of the literary ballad genre occurs simultaneously with an
   increase of interest in the folk ballad, and dates back to the end of
   the 18th - beginning of the 19th century. In the literary-philosophical
   consciousness of this time, which was also reflected on the ballad genre
   formation, a shift from the imitation of samples to the apology of
   national origins is clearly evident. A separate place in the development
   of the ballad genre belongs to the ``A Night in a Finnish Hut on a waste
   plot of land{''} by N. A. Lvov (1797) In the paper this ballad is
   considered in correlation with other, more stable genres of the Russian
   poetry of the 18th century - message, elegy, and idyll. Analyzed in
   detail are the principles of plot structuring, the dominant motifs, the
   imagebearing and stylistic structure of a poem or a rhyme.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the charged particle scattering in the

   scattering results from the violation of the adiabaticity of charged

   field. We consider the intermediate regime of charged particle dynamics,
   when the violation of the adiabaticity is significant enough, but
   particle motion is not chaotic. We demonstrate and describe the
   significant scattering of particles with large adiabatic invariants
   (magnetic moment). We discuss a possible application of obtained results
   for description of the peculiarities of pitch-angle diffusion of
   relativistic electrons in the Earth radiation belts. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Aim: To analyze our experience in translating the concept of total
   mesorectal excision to no-touch complete removal of an intact
   mesocolonic envelope (complete mesocolic excision), along with central
   vascular ligation and apical node dissection, in the surgical treatment
   of right-sided colonic cancers, comparing mesocolic to less radical
   non-mesocolic planes of surgery in respect to quality of the surgical
   specimen and long-term oncologic outcome.
   Method: A total of 115 patients with right-sided colonic cancers were
   retrospectively enrolled from 2008 to 2013 and operated on following the
   intent of minimally invasive complete mesocolic excision with central
   vascular ligation.
   Results: Morbidity and mortality were 22.6\% and 1.7\%, respectively.
   Mesocolic, intramesocolic, and muscularis propria planes of resection
   were achieved in 65.2\%, 21.7\%, and 13\% of cases, respectively, with
   significant impact for mesenteric plane of surgery on R0 resection rate
   (97.3\%), circumferential resection margin <1mm (2.6\%), and consequent
   survival advantage (82.6\% at 5years) when compared to muscularis
   propria plane of surgery, with R0 resection rate and overall survival
   falling to 72\% and 60\%, respectively, and with circumferential
   resection margin <1mm raising to 33.3\%, all being statistically
   significant. Stratifying patients for stage of disease, laparoscopic
   complete mesocolic excision with central vascular ligation significantly
   impacted survival in patients with stage II, IIIA/B, and in a subgroup
   of IIIC patients with negative apical nodes.
   Conclusion: In our experience, minimally invasive complete mesocolic
   excision with central vascular ligation allows for both safety and
   higher quality of surgical specimens when compared to less radical
   intramesocolic or muscularis propria planes of standard surgery,
   significantly impacting loco-regional control and thus overall survival.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the molecular geometry of heptachlor is investigated using
   ab initio HF, DFT, LDA, and GGA methods. The natural bond orbital (NBO)
   analysis is performed at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. The
   first order hyperpolarizability beta(total), the mean polarizability
   Delta alpha, the anisotropy of the polarizability Delta alpha, and the
   dipole moment mu, are calculated by B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) and HF/6-
   311++G(d,p) methods. The first order hyperpolarizability (beta(total))
   is calculated based on the finite field approach. UV spectral parameters
   along with HOMO, LUMO energies for heptachlor are determined in vacuum
   and the solvent phase using HF, DFT, and TD-DFT/B3LYP methods
   implemented with the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. Atomic charges and
   electron density of heptachlor in vacuum and ethanol are calculated
   using DFT/B3LYP and TD-DFT/B3LYP methods and the 6-311++G(d,p) basis
   set. In addition, after the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), the
   molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), the electrostatic potential
   (ESP), the electron density (ED), and the solvent accessible surface of
   heptachlor are visualized as a results of the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
   calculation. Densities of states (DOS), the external electric field (EF)
   effect on the HOMO-LUMO gap, and the dipole moment are investigated by

Abstract = {{This survey discusses the merits of public intervention in broadcasting
   markets. By means of a theoretical model, we derive cases of market
   imperfection in a two-sided market setup and survey the literature. We
   show that there is often no clear free-market bias in (for example)
   advertising levels, program quality, or channel diversity with respect
   to a socially optimal equilibrium. The economic literature paints a
   diverse picture of public provision of broadcasting. While public
   service broadcasting can indeed remedy some market failures, it may also
   exacerbate others. Thus, there is no simple rationale for public
   intervention in broadcasting markets based on the traditional theory of
   market failure.}},

Abstract = {{Replay of hippocampal place cell sequences has been proposed as a
   fundamental mechanism of learning and memory. However, the standard
   interpretation of replay has been challenged by reports that similar
   activity is observed before experience ('preplay'). By the preplay
   account, pre-existing temporal sequences are mapped onto new experiences
   without learning sequential structure. Here we employed high density
   recording methods to monitor hundreds of place cells simultaneously
   while rats explored multiple novel environments. While we observed large
   numbers of synchronous spiking events before experience, they were not
   temporally correlated with subsequent experience. Multiple measures
   differentiated pre-experience and postexperience events that, taken
   together, defined the latter but not the former as trajectory-depicting.
   The formation of events with these properties was prevented by
   administration of an NMDA-receptor antagonist during experience. These
   results suggest that the sequential structure of behavioral episodes is
   encoded during experience and reexpressed as trajectory events.}},

Abstract = {{Leaf-cutting ants rely on the obligate symbiosis with a fungus,
   Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, on which they feed. This fungus garden is
   maintained preferentially with green leaves in combination with other
   tissues of plant origin. The nutritional composition of this symbiotic
   relationship is extremely beneficial for the colony, representing the
   main food source for larvae and an important food component of adult
   workers. The objective of this study was to observe the behavioral
   repertoire of Atta sexdens rubropilosa during the preparation and
   incorporation of two different substrates, leaves and bait pellets, as
   well as the participation of each caste in these processes this process.
   The first substrate offered to the colonies were Citrus sp. leaves cut
   into disks and the second were pellets of citrus pulp bait formulated
   without the active ingredient. The observations were made under a
   stereomicroscope and were started when the first portion of the
   substrate offered was carried to the fungus garden. The behaviors
   executed during preparation and incorporation of the leaf disks, and
   subsequently of the bait pellets, were recorded using three colonies,
   with six repetitions of 5 and 7 hours per colony, respectively. Eight
   behavioral acts were recorded for the three castes found, irrespective
   of the substrate processed by the workers. Licking was the most
   frequently executed behavioral act, which occurred throughout the
   observation period, regardless of the substrate offered. Gardeners and
   generalists were the castes most engaged in the execution of this
   behavior. Considering the large number of individuals involved in the
   execution of this task, it can be concluded that this behavior is
   important for dispersion of the active ingredient and contamination of
   workers inside the colony.}},

Abstract = {{The production of medical imaging is a continuing trend in healthcare

   situations (e.g. X-ray, computer tomography) requires

   patient's age and weight, body region and clinical indication. These
   data are normally stored in several formats and with different
   nomenclatures, which hinder the continuous and automatic monitoring of
   these indicators and the comparison between several institutions and
   equipment. This article proposes a framework that aggregates, normalizes
   and provides different views over collected indicators. The developed
   tool can be used to improve the quality of radiologic procedures and
   also for benchmarking and auditing purposes. Finally, a case study and
   several experimental results related to radiation exposure and

Abstract = {{Oblique convergence at the Himalayan margin is hypothesized to be
   partitioned by orogen-normal thrusting and orogen-parallel strike-slip
   faulting. We conducted field mapping and remote sensing in the
   Dhaulagiri Range of Nepal, and the results reveal an active regional
   fault system termed the Western Nepal Fault System (WNFS). Right and
   normally offset Quaternary deposits and brittly deformed bedrock
   demarcate dextral slip along two strike-slip faults striking N40-50
   degrees W linked via an extensional right step over striking N10-20
   degrees E. The strike-slip attitudes subparallel bedrock foliation,
   while the step over cuts at a high angle (similar to 70 degrees). Fault
   slip data along the strike-slip segments trend N70 degrees W with minor
   dip component, top to north. Fault slip data and observed kinematics
   along the WNFS support our interpretation that the WNFS formed via
   arc-parallel stress. On the basis of geometry, kinematics, and
   structural position we correlate the WNFS to active faults between the
   Karakoram and Bari Gad faults. This suggests an similar to 350km long
   dextral fault system extending obliquely across the Western Nepal
   Himalaya which appears to intersect the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT) near
   83 degrees 30'E, coinciding with a large gradient in the arc-parallel
   component of GPS velocities. We interpret the WNFS to represent a class
   of orogen-parallel strike-slip faults working with subduction to
   accommodate obliquely convergent plate motion. Our observations support
   the hypothesis that the region lying between the MFT and the WNFS is a
   continental version of a fore-arc sliver bounded at its base by the Main
   Himalayan Thrust.}},

Abstract = {{Avalanche control by explosives is among the key temporary preventive
   measures. Hitherto, little is known about wave propagation in a snowpack
   caused by an explosion. During the winter 2013-2014 we performed field
   experiments on a flat study site. We triggered slurry explosive charges
   at different heights above the snow surface. At three different
   distances from the point of explosion we measured surface air pressure
   and accelerations of the snowpack at various depths. Cameras were placed
   in the snow pits for recording weak layer failure and crack propagation.
   We report empirical relations for the decay of near-surface air
   pressure, accelerations, displacement velocities and displacement with
   distance from the explosion and depth within the snowpack. Waves within
   the snowpack arrived earlier at the sensors than the corresponding air
   pressure waves at the microphones. Air pressure decayed stronger than
   accelerations within the snowpack. Weak layer failure mainly happened in
   the top part of the snowpack. We observed two types of weak layer
   failure, one caused by the direct impact of the air pressure wave close
   to the point of observation, the other by failure induced by the air
   pressure wave closer to the point of explosion and subsequent crack
   propagation. Our measurements increase the understanding of acoustic
   wave propagation in snow and can be used for comparison with numerical
   simulations. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The secretion of the stress hormone cortisol follows a diurnal circadian
   rhythm. There are indications that this rhythm is affected by stress
   early in life. This paper addresses the development of the cortisol
   circadian rhythm between 1 and 6 years of age, and the role of maternal
   stress and anxiety early in the child's life on this (developing)
   rhythm. Participants were 193 healthy mother-child dyads from a
   community sample. Self-reported maternal stress and anxiety and
   physiological stress (saliva cortisol), were assessed prenatally
   (gestational week 37). Postnatally, self-reported maternal stress and
   anxiety were measured at 3, 6, 12, 30, and 72 months, Saliva cortisol
   samples from the children were collected on two days (four times each
   day) at 12, 30, and 72 months of age. The total amount of cortisol
   during the day and the cortisol decline over the day were determined to
   indicate children's cortisol circadian rhythm. Multilevel analyses
   showed that the total amount of cortisol decreased between 1 and 6
   years. Furthermore, more maternal pregnancy-specific stress was related
   to higher total amounts of cortisol in the child. Higher levels of early
   postnatal maternal anxiety were associated with flatter cortisol
   declines in children. Higher levels of early postnatal maternal daily
   hassles were associated with steeper child cortisol declines over the
   day. These results indicated developmental change in children's cortisol
   secretion from 1 to 6 years and associations between maternal stress and
   anxiety early in children's lives and children's cortisol circadian
   rhythm in early childhood. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a very rare genetic
   disorder. Most cases of FOP arise as a result of spontaneous mutation. A
   few patients with an autosomal dominant genetic transmission are
   reported. There is no definitive approach to the prevention and
   treatment of disease. Early diagnosis prevents unnecessary diagnostic
   and therapeutic procedures which lead to the progression of the disease.
   Here, we present a case whose first symptoms began at 9 months of age
   with swelling and stiffness at the vaccinated region and progressed with
   exacerbations after the excisional biopsy of the lesion and the bone
   biopsy of the right arm. Symptomatic treatment and prophylactic measures
   aimed to improve the quality of life. Exacerbations during follow up
   were treated with oral prednisolone, alendronate and pamidronate.}},

Abstract = {{One hundred F-2 and F-3 single plant progenies along with their parents
   and the infector rows were evaluated for 13 quantitative traits to
   assess the genetic variability, heritability, associations and
   estimation of number of genes for bacterial leaf blight resistance and
   yield related traits. In both F2 and F3, a wide range of variability was
   present for all the traits, indicating considerable scope for selection.
   High heritability accompanied with high genetic advance was observed for
   plant height, panicle length, panicle weight, number of effective
   tillers per plant and grain yield per plant. Positive and significant
   correlation were observed between grain yield per plant with days to
   50\% flowering, plant height, panicle length, panicle weight, number of
   effective tillers per plant, test weight and flag leaf length in either
   one of the generation or in combination of both F-2 and F-3.
   Path-coefficients analysis showed that plant height, panicle length and
   test weight had high direct positive effect in both the F-2 and F-3. The
   estimated number of gene(s) in the segregating generations for bacterial
   leaf blight was 2.14 in the F-2 and 0.92 in the F-3 revealed that two
   genes were involved in the inheritance of resistance to bacterial leaf
   blight in F-2, while only one gene in F-3 due to dominance effect.}},

Abstract = {{Prospective motion correction (PMC) during brain imaging using
   camera-based tracking of a skin-attached marker may suffer from problems
   including loss of marker visibility due to the coil and false correction
   due to non-rigid-body facial motion, such as frowning or squinting. A
   modified PMC system is introduced to mitigate these problems and
   increase the robustness of motion correction.
   The method relies on simultaneously tracking two markers, each providing
   six degrees of freedom, that are placed on the forehead. This allows us
   to track head motion when one marker is obscured and detect skin
   movements to prevent false corrections. Experiments were performed to
   compare the performance of the two-marker motion correction technique to
   the previous single-marker approach.
   Experiments validate the theory developed for adaptive marker tracking
   and skin movement detection, and demonstrate improved image quality
   during obstruction of the line-of-sight of one marker when subjects
   squint or when subjects squint and move simultaneously.
   The proposed methods eliminate two common failure modes of PMC and
   substantially improve the robustness of PMC, and they can be applied to
   other optical tracking systems capable of tracking multiple markers. The
   methods presented can be adapted to the use of more than two markers.}},

Abstract = {{The HER2 gene is overexpressed in 15-20 \% of all breast cancers. With
   the advent of HER2-directed therapies, HER2 overexpression is no longer
   considered an adverse prognostic factor. Despite significant
   improvements in clinical outcomes with the use of trastuzumab
   {[}herceptin (H)], women aged > 65 years remain under-represented in
   most clinical trials. Cardiac safety in the elderly woman is a major
   concern because of pre-existing comorbidities. However, many studies
   suggest that elderly patients with HER2-positive disease derive the same
   benefit from trastuzumab as do their younger counterparts in both
   adjuvant and metastatic settings. Data are limited guiding safety and
   efficacy of other HER2 inhibitors such as pertuzumab and trastuzumab
   emtansine in elderly patients; however, in general, these drugs have a
   favorable toxicity profile.}},

   This one-pot, atom-economic, efficient, and highly regioselective green
   protocol ensures higher yield of beta-hydroxy triazole scaffolds
   (85-95\%). To make the process ecofriendly, this study emphasizes on the
   catalyst immobilization technique along with its possible recycling that
   gave a high reaction yield in up to three runs. The structures of all
   synthesized compounds have been characterized by comparing H-1 nuclear

Abstract = {{The effect of water/cement (w/c) ratio on the mechanical properties such
   as compressive strength and split tensile strength of cement mortar
   cylinders and cubes was investigated experimentally for 28 days curing
   period as per IS standard. Based upon the experimental results,
   empirical equations have been developed to predict the strength of
   cement mortar mixes with various w/c ratios. It is observed that Abrams'
   law is applicable for the cement mortar also. The cement mortar contains
   varying proportions of portland pozzolana cement (PPC) and river sand
   such as 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7, 1:8 with different w/c ratios. An
   empirical equation has been developed between split tensile strength and
   compressive strength of cement mortar. Results show that compressive
   strength and split tensile strength of cement mortar decreased with an
   increase in the w/c ratio. It is observed that minimum w/c ratio
   required to make the cement mortar workable is 0.5. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The kinetic parameters of sorption of phosphatidylcholine on mesoporous

   The adequacy of using the Boyd diffusion model and the Lagergren, Ho and

   phosphatidylcholine on mesoporous composites based on MCM-41 is shown.
   The contributions from diffusion limitation (internal and external) and
   the rate of the chemical step of adsorption to the overall rate of the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We propose an efficient single-molecule rectifier based on a derivative
   of opioid. Electron transport properties are investigated within the
   non-equilibrium Green's function formalism combined with density
   functional theory. The analysis of the current-voltage characteristics
   indicates obvious diode-like behavior. While heroin presents
   rectification coefficient R > 1, indicating preferential electronic
   current from electron-donating to electron-withdrawing, 3 and
   6-acetylmorphine and morphine exhibit contrary behavior, R < 1. Our
   calculations indicate that the simple inclusion of acetyl groups
   modulate a range of devices, which varies from simple rectifying to
   resonant-tunneling diodes. In particular, the rectification rations for
   heroin diodes show microampere electron current with a maximum of
   rectification (R = 9.1) at very low bias voltage of similar to 0.6 V and
   (R = 14.3) similar to 1.8 V with resistance varying between 0.4 and 1.5
   M Omega. Once most of the current single-molecule diodes usually
   rectifies in nanoampere, are not stable over 1.0 V and present
   electrical resistance around 10 M Omega. Molecular devices based on
   opioid derivatives are promising in molecular electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine the effect of transarterial chemoembolisation
   (TACE) on liver function and procedurerelated mortality in patients with
   unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumour
   thrombosis (PVTT).
   Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients with HCC and PVTT
   who underwent TACE from January 2012 to December 2013 at a single
   tertiary medical centre in Hong Kong. Patient demographics, aetiology of
   cirrhosis, alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level, tumour size, number of
   tumours, liver function (total bilirubin, albumin, international
   normalised ratio {[}INR(), and Child-Pugh score were evaluated before
   and 4 weeks after TACE. The 30-day mortality was also recorded.
   Results: TACE was performed in 26 patients with unresectable HCC and
   PVTT (mean age, 61 years). The mean total bilirubin level before and
   after TACE was 18.2 mu mol/l and 26.8 mu mol/l (p = 0.140),
   respectively, and mean albumin level fell from 36.8 g/l to 33.9 g/l (p =
   0.009). The respective mean INR before and after TACE was 1.1 and 1.2 (p
   = 0.120), the AFP level was 35,364.0 ng/ml and 37,424.5 ng/ml (p =
   0.563), and the mean Child-Pugh score was 6.0 and 6.6. The mean and
   median survival of patients was 5.1 months (range, 1.5-8.8 months) and
   there was no 30-day mortality.
   Conclusion: TACE has a deteriorating effect on liver function in
   patients with unresectable HCC and PVTT. Nonetheless since there were no
   procedure-related deaths and TACE has potential survival benefits, it
   should be a treatment option along with superselective catheterisation
   of tumour feeding vessels for patients with HCC and PVTT.}},

Abstract = {{Cervical cancer occurs only when the abnormal cells on the cervix will
   mature and unable to manage clearly in the reformation area. Mostly used
   technique for detecting the abnormal cervical cells is the routine and
   there will be no dissimilarity among the normal and abnormal nuclei. The
   color which is brown is abnormal nuclei and blue is the normal nuclei.
   Based on the Iterative Decision Based Algorithm, the cells are examined
   and the denoising of images is performed. Segmentation of the image is
   the procedure of grouping the digital image into compound sections. The
   preceding technique namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) will able
   classify only few nuclei regions but it will take high execution time.
   So, this research proposed a method called Fast Particle Swarm
   Optimization with Extreme Learning Machine (Fast PSO-ELM) for
   classifying all regions of nuclei into touching and non-touching region.
   This method is more efficient when compared with SVM method.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of petrophysical properties in carbonate rocks is
   strongly affected by depositional heterogeneity at different scales,
   complex mineralogy, and diagenetic modification. Superimposed complex
   depositional and diagenetic processes typical in carbonates lead to a
   very wide range of pore sizes involving many orders of magnitude of
   length scales. Pore types are a primary control on fluid movement in the
   reservoir and constitute the primary variable in determining
   petrophysical rock types. Multimodal pore systems and irregular water
   distribution across the field caused by complex charging history present
   challenges in water saturation modeling using conventional
   saturation-height functions. Bitumen quantification presents another
   challenge in carbonate reservoirs, especially in fields without nuclear
   magnetic resonance logs. Fractured reservoirs entail uncertainties
   related to characterization, modeling, and enhanced oil recovery aspects
   that involve matrix oil recovery via higher permeability fracture
   networks.
   These challenges exist in Tengiz Field, a Paleozoic isolated carbonate
   platform reservoir in the Precaspian Basin in Kazakhstan one of the
   world's deepest and most prolific supergiant fields with more than 25
   billion barrels original oil in place. The buildup includes: productive
   platform-top settings composed of grainstone and packstone with an
   average porosity of 8\%; and fractured margin and slope environments
   predominantly consisting of boundstone, breccia, and grain-dominated
   deposits with an average porosity of 4\%. Tengiz exhibits primary
   stratigraphic and depositional heterogeneity and has an extensive and
   complex diagenetic history that greatly modified original pore systems
   and affected present-day reservoir quality. This paper describes how the
   above challenges were addressed in petrophysical characterization of
   Tengiz field. The solutions include special core and log acquisition
   programs, bitumen modeling with Multimin calibrated with TOC data,
   comprehensive rock typing, hybrid water saturation modeling using pore
   based saturation-height functions and bulk volume water approach, total
   permeability from production logs, baffles identification from pressure
   gradients, and integrated fracture characterization.}},

Abstract = {{Prevalence data on Internet addiction in Europe are rather scarce due to
   the lack of agreement on the definition and measurement of the concept.
   We define Excessive Internet Use (EIU) as such use of online
   applications that puts the user at risk of adverse consequences. In this
   paper, we present a cross-country quasi-validation of the five-item
   Excessive Internet Use scale that is suitable for use in general
   population surveys. We worked with EU Kids Online II data for children
   aged 11-16 in 25 European countries and used a set of regression models
   to assess the probabilities of various negative consequences for each
   EIU score. A consistent pattern was identified across Europe when
   controlling for country differences, suggesting good psychometric
   properties of the scale. Moreover, our results indicate that EIU in
   children may be a symptom of broader behavioral difficulties rather than
   a condition, per se. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This report describes a patient who had an open repair of a small
   supraspinatus tendon tear performed 6 months after an arthroscopic
   acromioplasty with debridement had failed to provide pain relief. Three
   months prior to the tendon repair, he had a two-level cervical spine
   discectomy and fusion (C4-5, C5-6) that improved his neck pain. Florid
   suprascapular neuropathy was detected 10 weeks after the open rotator
   cuff repair. Evidence of some nerve recovery resulted in a long period
   of observation. But unsatisfactory improvement warranted decompression
   of the suprascapular notch, which was found to be very stenotic. At
   surgery, there was no evidence of neuroma, cyst, or other compressing
   lesion or tissue. Therefore, it was ultimately hypothesized that there
   was an exacerbation of a preexisting, but clinically unrecognized,
   entrapment of the suprascapular nerve in the suprascapular notch in the
   setting of cervical radiculopathy (primarily C5). Retrospectively it was
   also concluded that had this compressive etiology been recognized, it
   would have favored prompt decompression rather than the long observation
   period. Three years was required to achieve a good result following
   suprascapular notch decompression. The underlying C5 radiculopathy may
   have created a ``double crush syndrome{''} that contributed to the
   propensity for injury and the prolonged recovery. There should be
   heightened awareness of this problem in patients who do not have
   satisfactory improvement in shoulder pain from previous shoulder and
   neck surgery.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the association between menstrual pain severity
   and psychophysical measures of cold and pressure pain sensitivity. A
   cross-sectional design was used with young women (n = 432) from the
   Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Menstrual pain
   severity and oral contraception use was obtained from questionnaires at
   20 and 22-year follow-ups. A visual analog scale (VAS; range from 0
   {[}none] to 10 {[}unbearable]) was used to measure menstrual pain
   severity at both 20 and 22 years over the 3-year period, with 3 groups
   created: (1) no pain or mild pain (VAS 0-3), (2) at least moderate pain
   at a minimum of 1 of the 2 time points (hereafter named ``mixed){''},
   and (3) severe pain (VAS 8-10). Cold pain sensitivity (dorsal wrist) and
   pressure pain sensitivity (lumbar spine, upper trapezius, dorsal wrist,
   and tibialis anterior) were assessed using standardised quantitative
   sensory testing protocols. Confounding variables included number of
   musculoskeletal pain sites, oral contraceptive use, smoking, physical
   activity, body mass index, psychological distress, and sleep. Severe
   menstrual pain and mixed menstrual pain were positively associated with
   heightened cold pain sensitivity (distant from menstrual pain referral
   site) and pressure pain sensitivity (local to menstrual pain referral
   site). These associations remained significant after adjusting for
   potential confounding variables including multisite musculoskeletal
   pain. Our findings suggest peripheral and central neurophysiological
   mechanisms contributing to heightened pain sensitivity in young women
   with moderate and severe menstrual pain. These data highlight the need
   for innovative management approaches to attenuate the negative impact of
   severe menstrual pain in young women.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing number of children with non-malignant diseases can be
   cured by allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
   Treosulfan (L-treitol-1,4-bis-methanesulfonate) is being used more
   frequently for conditioning, owing to its' lower toxicity profile
   compared with conventional myeloablative regimens. A retrospective
   analysis was performed of children registered in the EBMT database, who
   received treosulfan before HSCT between January 2005 and 2010, to
   identify possible dose-related toxicity and determine the incidence of
   engraftment, treatment-related mortality and overall survival (OS).
   Results from 316 transplants from 11 different countries are presented.
   Ninety-five (30\%) were under 1 year of age at the time of transplant.
   OS was 83\%,and event-free survival was 76\%; 3-year OS and event-free
   survival of infants below 1 year were 79\% and 73\%, respectively. No
   association was found with age at transplant, dose of treosulfan given,
   other agents used in combination with treosulfan, donor type, stem cell
   source, or second or subsequent transplant. In this report of the
   largest number of children to date receiving treosulfan for
   non-malignant diseases, treosulfan is shown to be a safe and effective
   agent even for those under 1 year of age at the time of transplant.
   Further prospective studies are needed using precisely defined protocols
   with pharmacokinetic monitoring and detailed chimerism analysis. In
   addition, long-term studies will be vital to determine long-term
   effects, for example, on fertility in comparison with other regimens.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The purpose of this study was to report the treatment-induced
   adverse events and cosmetic and treatment outcomes of accelerated
   partial breast irradiation (APBI) delivered with the MammoSite radiation
   therapy system (RTS) in breast cancer patients undergoing
   breast-conserving therapy (BCT).
   Methods This is a prospective clinical trial that was approved by the
   institutional review board. The study included female breast cancer
   patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy in the form of surgery and
   APBI delivered with the MammoSite RTS. Patients and tumor
   characteristics, treatment-induced acute adverse events based on the
   Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 2.0, chronic
   AEs according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scale,
   treatment outcomes (including local control, disease-free survival, and
   overall survival), and cosmetic outcomes are reported.
   Results The study included 36 eligible patients treated consecutively in
   our institution between November 2003 and August 2009. The age range was
   45-83 years. A total of 29 patients had invasive disease (median size
   1.1 cm), while 7 patients had in situ disease only (median size 0.8 cm).
   The skin distance in most of the patients (91.7 \%) was >= 1 cm; only
   three patients (8.3 \%) had skin distance < 1 cm. The median balloon
   diameter was 5 cm (range 4-6 cm). At a median follow-up of 42 months
   (range 4-65 months), local control, disease-free survival, and overall
   survival were 100 \%. None of the patients experienced any grade 3 or 4
   toxicities; 16.7 and 5.6 \% of the patients had late grade 2 fibrosis
   and telangiectasia, respectively. At last follow-up, cosmetic outcome
   was rated as good or excellent in 94 \% of the patients.
   Conclusion APBI delivered with the MammoSite RTS is a feasible,
   tolerable, and effective treatment modality. Multicenter, randomized,
   controlled clinical trials with a larger number of patients are required
   for verification.}},

Journal = {{BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{155-163}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Theoretical advantages of endoscopic cubital tunnel
   release are the short incision, lower risk of nerve damage, reduced
   manipulation of the nerve and possible faster recovery.
   Sources of data:We systematically searched Medline (PubMed), Web of
   Science and Scopus databases using the following keywords: `endoscopic
   ulnar nerve', `endoscopic cubital nerve', `endoscopic ulnar compression'
   and `endoscopic ulnar neuropathy'. Twenty-one studies were included in
   this review. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Coleman
   Methodological Score.
   Areas of agreement:Endoscopic release is effective for cubital tunnel
   entrapment and allows adequate visualization of the site of entrapment.
   There is a negative association between the severity of the compression
   and reported outcomes. Injury to the medial branch of the antebrachial
   cutaneous nerve is less frequent thanks to the limited dissection. The
   most frequent complication is the development of a hematoma.
   Areas of controversy:It is unclear whether ulnar nerve instability is a
   contraindication to simple decompression.
   Growing points:The shorter time to return to work and the cosmetic
   appearance of the scar can be considered advantages of the endoscopic
   technique.
   Areas timely for developing research:There is a need to perform
   randomized clinical trials with common and validated scoring system with
   a longer duration of follow-up. The literature pertinent to endoscopic
   cubital tunnel release is lacking in the evaluation of the learning
   curve. Further investigations are necessary to assess the role of ulnar
   nerve instability.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine changes in the food choices of New Zealand (NZ)
   adults, between the 1997 National Nutrition Survey (NNS97) and the
   2008/09 NZ Adult Nutrition Survey (2008/09 NZANS).
   Design: The 2008/09 NZANS and the NNS97 were cross-sectional surveys of
   NZ adults (aged 15 years and over). Dietary intake data were collected
   using a computer-based 24 h diet recall. Logistic regression models were
   used to examine changes over time in the percentage reporting each food
   group, with survey year, sex and age group (19-30 years, 31-50 years,
   51-70 years, 71 years) as the variables.
   Setting: NZ households.
   Subjects: Adults aged 19 years and over (NNS97, n 4339; 2008/09 NZANS, n
   3995).
   Results: In the 2008/09 NZANS compared with NNS97, males and females
   were less likely to report consuming bread, potatoes, beef, vegetables,
   breakfast cereal, milk, cheese, butter, pies, biscuits, cakes and
   puddings, and sugar/confectionery (all P<0.001). In contrast, there was
   an increase in the percentage reporting rice and rice dishes (P<0.001),
   and among females a reported increase in snacks and snack bars (e.g.
   crisps, extruded snacks, muesli bars; P=0.007) and pasta and pasta
   dishes (P=0.017). Although food choices were associated with sex and age
   group, there were few differential changes between the surveys by sex or
   age group.
   Conclusions: For all age groups there was a shift in the percentage who
   reported consuming the traditional NZ foods, namely bread, beef,
   potatoes and vegetables, towards more rice and rice dishes. Declines in
   the consumption of butter, pies, biscuits, cakes and puddings are
   congruent with current dietary guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study evaluated the extent to which partial spoken or
   written information facilitates sentence recognition under degraded
   unimodal and multimodal conditions.
   Method: Twenty young adults with typical hearing completed sentence
   recognition tasks in unimodal and multimodal conditions across 3
   proportions of preservation. In the unimodal condition, performance was
   examined when only interrupted text or interrupted speech stimuli were
   available. In the multimodal condition, performance was examined when
   both interrupted text and interrupted speech stimuli were concurrently
   presented. Sentence recognition scores were obtained from simultaneous
   and delayed response conditions.
   Results: Significantly better performance was obtained for unimodal
   speech-only compared with text-only conditions across all proportions
   preserved. The multimodal condition revealed better performance when
   responses were delayed. During simultaneous responses, participants
   received equal benefit from speech information when the text was
   moderately and significantly degraded. The benefit from text in degraded
   auditory environments occurred only when speech was highly degraded.
   Conclusions: The speech signal, compared with text, is robust against
   degradation likely due to its continuous, versus discrete, features.
   Allowing time for offline linguistic processing is beneficial for the
   recognition of partial sensory information in unimodal and multimodal
   conditions. Despite the perceptual differences between the 2 modalities,
   the results highlight the utility of multimodal speech + text signals.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
   cardiorespiratory response and energy expenditure during the practice of
   Tai Chi Easy (TCE). TCE has been proposed as a low-intensity alternative
   to traditional physical activity.
   Design: Oxygen cost data were collected from 10 healthy adult women
   (mean age of 47.9 +/- 12.8 years) at rest and during a 30-min session of
   TCE using an automated metabolic cart and heart rate (HR) telemetry. The
   Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale was utilized to measure
   subjective intensity of the TCE movements.
   Results: The mean oxygen consumption (VO2) for the movements ranged from
   4.3 ml kg(-1) min(-1) to 5.5 ml kg(-1) min(-1) with an overall mean of
   5.0 ml kg(-1) min(-1). The mean HR for all activity was 67.0 beats per
   minute and the mean energy expenditure (EE) was 1.6 Kcal min(-1).
   Conclusions: Cardiorespiratory and EE responses to TCE indicate that
   this a low intensity exercise appropriate for individuals requiring
   activity prescriptions of approximately 2 metabolic equivalents (METs).

Title = {{Mutational Disruption of cis-Acting Replication Element 2C in
   Coxsackievirus B3 Leads to 5 `-Terminal Genomic Deletions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{11761-11772}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Following natural human or experimental murine infections and in cell
   culture, coxsackievirus B (CVB) RNA can persist for weeks in the absence
   of a cytopathic effect, yet viral RNA remains detectable. Our earlier
   studies demonstrated that this persistence produced viral RNA with up to
   49 nucleotide deletions at the genomic 5' terminus which partially
   degraded the cloverleaf (or domain I), an RNA structure required for
   efficient viral replication. A cis-acting replication element (CRE) in
   the 2C protein-coding region {[}CRE(2C)] templates the addition of two
   uridine residues to the virus genome-encoded RNA replication primer VPg
   prior to positive-strand synthesis. Because our previous work also
   demonstrated that the genomes of CVB with a 5'-terminal deletion
   (CVB-TD) have VPg covalently linked, even though they rarely terminate
   in the canonical UU donated by CRE(2C)mediated uridylylation of VPg, we
   hypothesized that a functional (uridylylating) CRE(2C) would be
   unnecessary for CVB-TD replication. Using the same 16 mutations in the
   CVB3 CRE(2C) structure that were considered lethal for this virus by
   others, we demonstrate here both in infected cell cultures and in mice
   that wild-type (wt) and CVB3-TD strains carrying these mutations with a
   nonuridylylating CRE(2C) are viable. While the wt genome with the
   mutated CRE(2C) displays suppressed replication levels similar to those
   observed in a CVB3-TD strain, mutation of the CRE(2C) function in a
   CVB3-TD strain does not further decrease replication. Finally, we show
   that replication of the parental CVB3 strain containing the mutated
   CRE(2C) drives the de novo generation of genomic deletions at the 5'
   terminus.
   IMPORTANCE
   In this report, we demonstrate that while CVB can replicate without a
   uridylylating CRE(2C), the replication rate suffers significantly.
   Further, deletions at the 5' terminus of the genome are generated in
   this virus population, with this virus population supplanting the
   wild-type population. This demonstrates that VPg can prime without being
   specifically uridylylated and that this priming is error prone,
   resulting in the loss of sequence information from the 5' terminus.
   These findings have significance when considering the replication of
   human enteroviruses, and we believe that these data are unattainable in
   a cell-free system due to the poor replication of these CRE-deficient
   viruses.}},

Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Y-box proteins YBX2 and YBX3 bind RNA and DNA and are required for
   metazoan development and fertility. However, possible functional
   redundancy between YBX2 and YBX3 has prevented elucidation of their
   molecular function as RNA masking proteins and identification of their
   target RNAs. To investigate possible functional redundancy between YBX2
   and YBX3, we attempted to construct Ybx2(-/-); Ybx3(-/-) double mutants
   using a previously reported Ybx2(-/-) model and a newly generated global
   Ybx3(-/-) model. Loss of YBX3 resulted in reduced male fertility and
   defects in spermatid differentiation. However, homozygous double mutants
   could not be generated as haploinsufficiency of both Ybx2 and Ybx3
   caused sterility characterized by extensive defects in spermatid
   differentiation. RNA sequence analysis of mRNP and polysome occupancy in
   single and compound Ybx2/3 heterozygotes revealed loss of translational
   repression almost exclusively in the compound Ybx2/3 heterozygotes.
   RNAseq analysis also demonstrated that Y-box protein dose-dependent loss
   of translational regulation was inversely correlated with the presence
   of a Y box recognition target sequence, suggesting that Y box proteins
   bind RNA hierarchically to modulate translation in a range of targets.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of the Chenopodium ambrosioides L
   (mastruz) extract for preventing bone loss and bone metabolism in
   ovariectomized rats.
   METHODS: Twelve rats were subjected to bilateral ovariectomy for
   inducing osteoporosis. After surgery, they were divided into two groups:
   Ovariectomy-control group (G1, n=6), receiving 0.5 ml distilled water by
   gavage for 30 days, and Ovariectomy plus mastruz group (G2, n=6),
   receiving 0.5 ml of the hydroalcoholic extract of mastruz at 10\%
   concentration (50mg) daily, for the same period. Then, the blood of the
   animals was collected for further biochemical analysis (liver function)
   and tibia and liver were removed for histological and histomorphometric
   analyses.
   RESULTS: The cortical bone was significantly larger in the G2 than G1,
   whereas G1 presented the highest amount of adipocytes in the bone marrow
   (p<0.05). The blood levels of aspartate aminotransferase, triglycerides
   and cholesterol were significantly higher, whereas globulin and lactate
   dehydrogenase were smaller in G2 than G1.
   CONCLUSION: The hydroalcoholic extract of mastruz has effects on bone
   metabolism by changing blood proteins and enzymes and preventing both
   bone loss and the substitution of bone marrow cells by}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) generates myocardial scar and
   arrhythmogenic substrate. CS diagnosis according to the Japanese
   Ministry of Health and Welfare guidelines relies, among others, on
   cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement
   (CMR-LGE). However, access to CMR-LGE is limited. The
   electrocardiography-based Selvester QRS score has been validated for
   identifying myocardial scar in ischemic/nonischemic cardiomyopathy, but
   its efficacy has not been tested to evaluate CS.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to examine whether the QRS score
   can be applied to CS.
   METHODS CS-associated myocardial scar was assessed by both CMR-LGE and
   QRS scoring in patients with extra-CS (n = 59).
   RESULTS Of 59 patients, 35 (59\%) were diagnosed with CS according to
   the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare guidelines. QRS-estimated
   scar mass positively correlated with that quantified by CMR-LGE (signal
   intensity >= 2SD above the reference; r = 0.68; P < .001). Receiver
   operating characteristic curves demonstrated optimal cutoffs of 9\%
   CMR-LGE scar and 3-point QRS score to identify patients with CS. The
   areas under the curves of CMR-LGE and the QRS score were not
   significantly different (0.83 and 0.78, respectively; P =.27); both
   methods demonstrated similar diagnostic performance. A QRS score of >= 3
   led to a higher incidence of CS-associated adverse events (death/fatal
   arrhythmia/ heart failure hospitalization) than did a QRS score of <3
   (35 +/- 21 months of follow-up; P = .01). QRS score was an independent
   predictor of risk in multivariate analysis (P = .03).
   CONCLUSION The Selvester QRS scoring estimates CS-associated myocardial
   damage and identifies patients with CS equally well as CMR-LGE. A higher
   QRS score is also associated with an increased risk of life-threatening
   events in CS, indicating its potential use as a risk predictor.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{Neurofibrillary tangles, composed of hyperphosphorylated tau fibrils,
   are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease; the neurofibrillary
   tangle load correlates strongly with clinical progression of the
   disease. A growing body of evidence indicates that tau oligomer
   formation precedes the appearance of neurofibrillary tangles and
   contributes to neuronal loss. Here we show that tau oligomer formation
   can be inhibited by compounds whose chemical backbone includes
   1,2-dihydroxybenzene. Specifically, we demonstrate that
   1,2-dihydroxybenzene-containing compounds bind to and cap cysteine
   residues of tau and prevent its aggregation by hindering interactions
   between tau molecules. Further, we show that orally administered
   DL-isoproterenol, an adrenergic receptor agonist whose skeleton includes
   1,2-dihydroxybenzene and which penetrates the brain, reduces the levels
   of detergent-insoluble tau, neuronal loss and reverses neurofibrillary
   tangle-associated brain dysfunction. Thus, compounds that target the
   cysteine residues of tau may prove useful in halting the progression of
   Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated nitrogen fertilisation is crucial for optimising forage maize
   production while simultaneously limiting the risks of nitrate leaching.
   This study summarises the results of a large number of experimental
   trials carried out over almost two decades. Its findings confirm that
   nitrogen fertilisation has a major effect on forage maize production and
   crude protein (CP) levels. Forage maize has lower mean CP values than it
   did 20 years ago, a trend that is linked to a change in the varieties
   bred. A method for estimating the plant's nitrogen needs is described.
   Splitting the dose of nitrogen fertiliser to be applied allows farmers
   to efficiently match the crop's nitrogen absorption kinetics, which is
   important at the end of its growth cycle. The need for nitrogen is
   greatest between the 8-leaf and 12-leaf stages.}},

Abstract = {{Organometallic complexes have the potential to behave as catalytic
   drugs. We investigate here Rh(III) complexes of general formula
   {[}(Cp-x)Rh(N,NO(Cl)], where N,N' is ethylenediamine (en),
   2,2'-bipyridine (bpy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) or
   N-(2-aminoethyl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzenesulfonamide (TfEn), and Cp-x
   is pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp-xPhPh),
   1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp-xPh) or
   1-biphenyl-2,3,4,5-tetramethyl cyclopentadienyl (Cp-xPhPh). These
   complexes can reduce NAD(+) to NADH using formate as a hydride source
   under biologically-relevant conditions. The catalytic activity decreased
   in the order of N,N-chelated ligand bpy > phen > en with Cp{*} as the
   eta(5)-donor. The en complexes (1-3) became more active with extension
   to the Cp-X ring, whereas the activity of the phen (7-9) and bpy (4-6)
   compounds decreased. {[}Cp{*}Rh(bpy)Cl](+) (4) showed the highest
   catalytic activity, with a TOF of 37.4 +/- 2 h(-1). Fast hydrolysis of
   the chlorido complexes 1-10 was observed by H-1 NMR (<10 min at 310 K).
   The pK(a){*} values for the aqua adducts were determined to be ca. 8-10.
   Complexes 1-9 also catalysed the reduction of pyruvate to lactate using
   formate as the hydride donor. The efficiency of the transfer
   hydrogenation reactions was highly dependent on the nature of the
   chelating ligand and the Cp-x ring. Competition reactions between NAD(+)
   and pyruvate for reduction by formate catalysed by 4 showed a preference
   for reduction of NAD(+). The antiproliferative activity of complex 3
   towards A2780 human ovarian cancer cells increased by up to 50\% when
   administered in combination with nontoxic doses of formate, suggesting
   that transfer hydrogenation can induce reductive stress in cancer cells.

Abstract = {{This article examines the impact of youth transition regimes (YTR) on
   the political participation strategies of young people from 26 locations
   in 12 European countries. The central hypothesis is that the way that
   youth transitions take place in different European contexts determines
   the position of youth as a group in the system of social relations that
   Bourdieu calls the social space'. Depending upon this position, young
   people may be more inclined to participation through institutional
   channels or political protest, or, in contrast, remain inactive. Thus,
   the specific context of youth in each society (measured through the
   exposure to risk and vulnerability, the length of the pathway to
   adulthood and the role of the welfare state) plays a crucial role in
   defining young people's political action strategies. Multilevel logistic
   regression analysis using the MYPLACE survey, the specific
   operationalization of the YTR and other aggregate control variables
   reveal that YTR centrality is a very important contextual predictor for
   explaining different forms of political participation among young people
   in Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Early postwar Czech travel writing was mainly concerned with
   representations of countries from the newly emerging Soviet Bloc and
   former European colonies in the developing world. In this way, travel
   writing played a role in nation building and the creation of new
   cultural identity. However, following the slow process of political
   liberalization, the United States became an increasingly visible feature
   of travel narratives, concomitant with interest and reception of
   American literature in the second half of the 1950s and throughout the
   1960s. While focusing on the analysis of space and articulation of the
   identities of travelers/narrators, this article tracks the re-emergence
   of the image of the United States in various types of travel narratives
   in order to depict a trajectory from the representation of a strictly
   bipolar world in political reportage from the early 1950s, to its
   subversion in the travel writing of the 1960s.}},

Abstract = {{The new {[}Co(btmgn)Cl (2)] complex and the
   1,8-bis(tetramethylguanidino)naphthalene (btmgn) ligand were synthesized
   and characterized. The X-ray single crystal investigation showed
   distorted tetrahedral geometry around the Co(II) ion. The geometry of
   the btmgn and {[}Co(btmgn)Cl (2)] complex was optimized using the
   B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) method. The calculated geometric parameters at the
   optimized structure of the {[}Co(btmgn)Cl (2)] complex showed good
   agreement with our reported X-ray structure. The two
   tetramethylguanidino groups are in a cis-type position to the
   naphthalene ring plane both in the free and coordinated btmgn. The large
   red shift of the upsilon (C=N) mode upon coordination indicates the
   strong ligand-metal interactions. The calculated natural charges using
   natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis at the two coordinated Cl-atoms are
   not equivalent. Also the two LP(4)Cl -> LP{*}(3)Co intramolecular charge
   transfer interaction energies (E ((2))) are 29.00 and 39.17 kcal/mol,
   respectively. The two Co-Cl bonds are not equivalent where the longer
   Co-Cl bond has more electronegative chlorine atom than the shorter one.
   Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) study of the btmgn ligand showed
   that the N4 and N7 atoms are the most reactive nucleophilic centers for
   the coordination with the Co (2+) ion. The {[}Co(btmgn)Cl (2)] complex
   has higher polarizability (alpha (0)), first hyperpolarizability (beta
   (0)) and lower energy gap (Delta E) than the free ligand. The TD-DFT
   calculations predicted the transition bands at 337.2 nm (f =0.2299, H ->
   L) and 342.6 nm (f =0.1465, H-2/H -> L) for the btmgn and {[}Co(btmgn)Cl
   (2)], respectively.}},

Abstract = {{To reduce complexity, understand generalized rules of protein folding,
   and facilitate de novo protein design, the 20-letter amino acid alphabet
   is commonly reduced to a smaller alphabet by clustering amino acids
   based on some measure of similarity. In this work, we seek the optimal
   alphabet that preserves as much of the structural information found in
   long-range (contact) interactions among amino acids in natively-folded
   proteins. We employ the Information Maximization Device, based on
   information theory, to partition the amino acids into well-defined
   clusters. Numbering from 2 to 19 groups, these optimal clusters of amino
   acids, while generated automatically, embody well-known properties of
   amino acids such as hydrophobicity/polarity, charge, size, and
   aromaticity, and are demonstrated to maintain the discriminative power
   of long-range interactions with minimal loss of mutual information. Our
   measurements suggest that reduced alphabets (of less than 10) are able
   to capture virtually all of the information residing in native contacts
   and may be sufficient for fold recognition, as demonstrated by extensive
   threading tests. In an expansive survey of the literature, we observe
   that alphabets derived from various approaches-including those derived
   from physicochemical intuition, local structure considerations, and
   sequence alignments of remote homologs-fare consistently well in
   preserving contact interaction information, highlighting a convergence
   in the various factors thought to be relevant to the folding code.
   Moreover, we find that alphabets commonly used in experimental protein
   design are nearly optimal and are largely coherent with observations
   that have arisen in this work. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A diverting temporary stoma is frequently used to decrease the chance of
   anastomosis leakage in the middle and lower rectum cancer surgeries, but
   its role in preventing the leakage is still doubtful. This study has
   been designed to evaluate any possible anastomosis complications after a
   rectum resection and a low or ultralow anastomosis when no diverting
   stoma is applied in patients with rectal cancer. Twenty-eight patients
   suffering from rectal cancer were treated by a low anterior resection
   between the years 2005 and 2008 in Imam Reza University Hospital,
   Mashhad, Iran. Out of the 28 patients, 6 patients had already undergone
   a course of neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Anastomosis was performed manually
   in 23 patients, using a stapler in 5 of them. None of the patients had a
   diverting stoma. Then, the outcome was evaluated. Fecal incontinence
   occurred in one of the patients (6.7 \%) who had already undergone a
   course of radiotherapy preoperatively and had a stapler used for
   anastomosis. No leakage was detected in any of them. The very low
   incidence of complications in this study, such as those not preventable
   by a diverting stoma, suggest a very low chance of leakage in low or
   ultralow anastomosis in patients with rectal cancer and in those who
   were treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{Rectal cancer is one of the common cancers in India. Surgical management
   is the mainstay of initial treatment for majority of patients. Minimally
   invasive surgery has gained acceptance for the surgical treatment of
   rectal cancer because, compared with laparotomy, it is associated with
   fewer complications, shorter hospitalization, and faster recovery. The
   aim of this study is to evaluate the safety, feasibility, technique, and
   outcomes (postoperative, oncological, and functional) of
   robotic-assisted rectal surgery in comparison with open surgery in the
   Indian population. A prospective randomized study was undertaken from
   August 2011 to December 2012. Fifty patients who presented with rectal
   carcinoma were randomized to either robotic arm (RA) or open arm (OA)
   group. Both groups were matched for clinical stage and operation type.
   Technique and feasibility of robotic-assisted surgery in terms of
   operating time, estimated blood loss, margins status, total number of
   lymph nodes retrieved, hospital stay, conversion to open procedure,
   complications, and functional outcomes were analyzed. The mean operative
   time was significantly longer in the RA than in the OA group 310 vs 246
   min, P < 0.001) but was significantly reduced in the latter part of the
   robotic-assisted patients compared with the initial patients. The mean
   estimated blood loss was significantly less in the RA compared with the
   OA group (165.14 vs 406.04 ml, P < 0.001). None of the patients had
   margin positivity. The mean distal resection margin was significantly
   longer in the RA than in the OA group (3.6 vs 2.4 cm, P < 0.001). A
   total of 100 \% of patients in the RA group had complete mesorectal
   excision while two patients in the OA group had incomplete mesorectal
   excision. The average number of retrieved lymph nodes was adequate for
   accurate staging. The number of lymph nodes removed by robotic method is
   slightly higher than the open method (16.88 vs 15.20) but with no
   statistical significance. Conversion rate was nil. The mean hospital
   stay was significantly shorter in the RA group (7.52 vs 13.24 days, P <
   0.001). Postoperative and functional outcomes were comparable between
   the two groups. Robotic-assisted surgery is an emerging technique in our
   country. Robotic-assisted rectal cancer surgery is safe with low
   conversion rates and acceptable morbidity and is oncologically feasible.}},

Abstract = {{A report is presented on the advantages of the rapid interphase
   chromosome assay (RICA) and the difficulties that may be met while
   implementing this method for application in biological dosimetry. The
   RICA test can be applied on unstimulated human lymphocytes; this is an
   advantage in comparison with the dicentric chromosomes or micronucleus
   tests. In the former two tests, stimulated lymphocytes are examined and
   hence, 48 h more are needed to obtain cells traversing the cell cycle.
   Due to the use of unstimulated nondividing cells, higher numbers of
   cells are available for RICA analysis than for dicentric chromosomes or
   micronuclei tests. Moreover, the method can be applied after exposure to
   ionizing radiation doses in excess of 5 Gy. Such doses cause a
   significant cell cycle delay or result in the loss of G2 phase and
   mitotic cells because of apoptosis. Therefore, the traditional
   biodosimetry based on the evaluation of the incidence of damage to
   chromosomes is very difficult to carry out. This is due to the lack of
   an adequate number of mitotic cells for analysis. RICA is free of this
   disadvantage. An automatic microscope can be used to retrieve cell
   images; automatic image analysis can also be used.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzed the characteristics of flood damages and the effects
   of structural and non-structural flood damage mitigation measures in
   Korea. First, a theoretical discussion of the structural and
   non-structural measures to mitigate flood damages was used to select the
   variables and devise the hypotheses. An analysis was conducted using the
   Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving-Average (ARIMA) time series
   methodology, Korean socioeconomic data, and damage characteristics of
   major flood events. The effects of flood damage mitigation measures on
   the extent of flood damages were assessed using an intervention time
   series model. The major findings were that the intervention effects of
   structural and non-structural measures were statistically significant
   from 1958 to 2013 (a period of 55 years) and that while the former were
   ineffective at mitigating flood damages, the latter were successful in
   doing so. Based on the above findings, policy suggestions for future
   flood damage mitigation measures in Korea were offered. For structural
   measures, the government should manage its existing facilities, recover
   ecosystems of damaged rivers, and devise mitigation measures for urban
   areas. For non-structural measures, the government should enhance its
   flood forecasting capacity, revise laws related to flood control and
   prevention, and update and rationalize land-use plans.}},

   suggested A U-shaped transmission line is adopted instead of a
   conventional transmission line to reduce the size of the BPF on the low
   dielectric substrate. The size of the conventional narrow BPF is reduced
   by more than 70\% due to the reduction of the length of the transmission
   line within the inverter. The experimental results show that the
   insertion loss and return loss are 1.61 dB and 15.4 dB, respectively,
   with bandwidth of 5\% at the center frequency of 5.8 GHz. The designed
   BPF shows a harmonics rejection up to third ((3)f(0)) and fifth
   ((5)f(0)), with more than 18 dB rejection level in the simulation and

Abstract = {{Aim To investigate the performance of HbA(1c) in predicting incident
   diabetes among Korean adults with normal fasting glucose and impaired
   fasting glucose levels.
   Methods This study used data from the Korean Genome Epidemiology
   Study-Kangwha Study. A prospective analysis was carried out on 2079
   people (820 men and 1259 women) who completed follow-up examinations up
   until 2013. Diabetes was defined as fasting blood glucose level >= 7.0
   mmol/l, HbA(1c) level >= 48 mmol/mol (6.5\%), or current treatment for
   diabetes. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves were
   used to assess the different performances of HbA(1c), glucose and
   insulin in predicting diabetes.
   Results The median follow-up time was 3.97 years, during which 7.7\% of
   men and 6.3\% of women developed incident diabetes. The areas under the
   receiver-operating curves (95\% CI) for diabetes prediction were 0.740
   (0.692-0.787) for HbA(1c), 0.716 (0.667-0.764) for glucose and 0.598
   (0.549-0.648) for insulin. HbA(1c) showed better predictive power in
   people with impaired fasting glucose (area under the curve 0.753, 95\%
   CI 0.685-0.821) than in those with normal glucose (area under the curve
   0.648, 95\% CI 0.577-0.719). An HbA(1c) threshold of 40 mmol/mol (5.8\%)
   was found to have the highest predictive value for diabetes, with a
   relative risk of 6.30 (95\% CI 3.49-11.35) in men and 3.52 (95\% CI
   2.06-6.03) in women after adjusting for age, waist circumference,
   triglycerides, hypertension, family history of diabetes, smoking,
   alcohol intake, exercise and baseline glucose level.
   Conclusions HbA(1c) can be used to identify people at high risk for the
   development of diabetes, especially in those with impaired fasting
   glucose levels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper highlights the major achievements of the ATLAS program, which
   is an integral effect test program for both developing advanced light
   water reactor technologies and contributing to enhancing nuclear safety.
   The ATLAS program is closely related with the development of the APR1400
   and APR(+) reactors, and the SPACE code, which is a best-estimate
   system-scale code for a safety analysis of nuclear reactors. The
   multiple roles of ATLAS testing are emphasized in very close conjunction
   with the development, licensing, and commercial deployment of these
   reactors and their safety analysis codes. The role of ATLAS for nuclear
   safety enhancement is also introduced by taking some examples of its
   contributions to voluntarily lead to multi-body cooperative programs
   such as domestic and international standard problems. Finally, a future
   plan for the utilization of ATLAS testing is introduced, which aims at
   tackling recently emerging safety issues such as a prolonged station
   blackout accident and medium-size break LOCA, and some generic
   thermal-hydraulic concerns as to how to figure out multi-dimensional
   phenomena and the scaling issue. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent in the USA and is
   recognized as an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic
   cardiovascular disease. Identification of atherosclerosis risk factor
   attributable to OSA may provide opportunity to develop preventive
   measures for cardiovascular risk reduction. Chronic intermittent hypoxia
   (CIH) is a prominent feature of OSA pathophysiology and may be a major
   mechanism linking OSA to arteriosclerosis. Animal studies demonstrated
   that CIH exposure facilitated high-cholesterol diet (HCD)-induced
   atherosclerosis, accelerated the progression of existing
   atherosclerosis, and induced atherosclerotic lesions in the absence of
   other atherosclerosis risk factors, demonstrating that CIH is an
   independent causal factor of atherosclerosis. Comparative studies
   revealed major differences between CIH-induced and the classic
   HCD-induced atherosclerosis. Systemically, CIH was a much weaker inducer
   of atherosclerosis. CIH and HCD differentially activated inflammatory
   pathways. Histologically, CIH-induced atherosclerotic plaques had no
   clear necrotic core, contained a large number of CD31+ endothelial
   cells, and had mainly elastin deposition, whereas HCD-induced plaques
   had typical necrotic cores and fibrous caps, contained few endothelial
   cells, and had mainly collagen deposition. Metabolically, CIH caused
   mild, but HCD caused more severe dyslipidemia. Mechanistically, CIH did
   not, but HCD did, cause macrophage foam cell formation. NF-kappa B p50
   gene deletion augmented CIH-induced, but not HCD-induced
   atherosclerosis. These differences reflect the intrinsic differences
   between the two types of atherosclerosis in terms of pathological nature
   and underlying mechanisms and support the notion that CIH-induced
   atherosclerosis is a new paradigm that differs from the classic
   HCD-induced atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{A commonly used data assimilation (DA) algorithm, Kalman filter, is
   integrated with the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average
   (SARIMA) model to make a one-step forecast of monthly municipal solid
   waste (MSW) generation in Seattle. The DA solves the problem that
   parameters of the forecasting model need to be updated in every
   forecasting process. The performances of prediction models are compared
   using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-square-error
   (RMSE), and 95\% confidence interval. The MAPE of the SARIMA model with
   DA is 0.0422, whereas the MAPE of the SARIMA without DA is 0.0914. A
   95\% confidence interval of SARIMA without DA keeps increasing, whereas
   SARIMA with DA remains constant, which means DA raises the stability of
   SARIMA as time progresses. Results show that DA enables the same MSW
   prediction model with more accurate and more robust forecast results.
   The SARIMA parameter updating cycle can be prolonged, which saves time
   and effort. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The anode performance of mesocarbon microbeads (MCMBs) is tested as they
   are used in sodium-ion batteries. The MCMBs carbonized at 700 degrees C
   consist of graphite-like crystallites with an interlayer distance of 357
   pm, and with a crystal stack height of 1.61 nm. They deliver an initial
   charge capacity of 232 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 25 mA g(-1),
   and keep a reversible capacity of 161 mAh g(-1) after 60 cycles. The
   MCMB anodes exhibit good reversible sodium insertion/extraction
   behavior, which results from their internal crystallites and their
   unique external spherical surface layers. XRD and Raman analyses
   indicate that the MCMB anode stores energy by the electrochemical
   intercalation of sodium into the graphene sheets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Influence of arsenic disulfide (As2S2) on human immune cells has little
   been investigated. Effects of As2S2 on proliferation, cytokine
   production, and frequencies of CD4(+) T, CDS+ T and
   CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in mitogen-activated human
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells were examined. Anti-proliferative
   effects of As2S2 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells activated by
   T-cell mitogen were assessed by a colorimetric assay. Cytokine
   concentrations in the culture medium were measured with beads-array
   procedures followed by flow cytometry. CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells
   and CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells were stained with
   fluorescence-labeled specific antibodies followed by flow cytometry
   analysis. As2S2 at 1-10 mu M significantly suppressed mitogen-activated
   proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (p < 0.05). As2S2 at
   10 PM inhibited production of IL-6, -10, -17A, tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma from the activated peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells, though the effects were not statistically
   significant. As2S2 at 10 mu M significantly suppressed the frequencies
   of CD4(+) T and CD8(+) T cells (p < 0.05), whereas significantly
   enhanced the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (p <
   0.05). The data suggest that As2S2 attenuates T cell-mediated immunity
   by not only suppressing the proliferation of T cells and cytokine
   release but also increasing the frequency of regulatory T cells. T
   cell-mediated autoimmunity contributes to bone marrow failure in
   myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and thus the above As2S2 effects are
   beneficial for the treatment of MDS patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A novel piezoelectric energy harvester equipped with two piezoelectric
   beams and two cylinders was proposed in this work. The energy harvester
   can convert the kinetic energy of water into electrical energy by means
   of vortex-induced vibration (VIV) and wake-induced vibration (WIV). The
   effects of load resistance, water velocity and cylinder diameter on the
   performance of the harvester were investigated. It was found that the
   vibration of the upstream cylinder was VIV which enhanced the energy
   harvesting capacity of the upstream piezoelectric beam. As for the
   downstream cylinder, both VIV and the WIV could be obtained. The VIV was
   found with small L/D, e.g., 2.125, 2.28, 2.5, and 2.8. Additionally, the
   WIV was stimulated with the increase of L/D (such as 3.25, 4, and 5.5).
   Due to the WIV, the downstream beam presented better performance in
   energy harvesting with the increase of water velocity. Furthermore, it
   revealed that more electrical energy could be obtained by appropriately
   matching the resistance and the diameter of the cylinder. With optimal
   resistance (170 k Omega) and diameter of the cylinder (30 mm), the
   maximum output power of 21.86 mu W (sum of both piezoelectric beams) was
   obtained at a water velocity of 0.31 m/s.}},

Abstract = {{Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, which solves the full
   three-dimensional (3D) Navier-Stokes equations, has been recognized as
   having promise in providing a more detailed and accurate analysis for
   oil-film journal bearings than the traditional Reynolds analysis,
   although there are still challenging issues requiring further
   investigation, such as the modeling of cavitation and the modeling of
   conjugate heat transfer effects in the CFD analysis of bearings. In this
   paper, a 3D CFD method for the analysis of journal bearings considering
   the above two effects has been developed; it employs three different
   cavitation models, including the Half-Sommerfeld model, a vaporous
   cavitation model, and a gaseous cavitation model. The method has been
   used to analyze a two-groove journal bearing and the results are
   validated with experimental measurements and the traditional Reynolds
   solutions. It is found that the CFD method which considers the conjugate
   heat transfer and employs the gaseous cavitation model gives better
   predictions of both bearing load and temperature than either the
   traditional Reynolds solution or CFD with other cavitation models. The
   CFD results also show strong recirculation of the fresh oil in the
   grooves, which has been neglected in the traditional Reynolds solution.
   The above results show conclusively that the present 3D CFD method
   considering the conjugate heat transfer and employing the gaseous
   cavitation model provides an efficient tool for more detailed and
   accurate analysis for bearing performance.}},

Abstract = {{Non-overlapping field-of-view (FOV) cameras are used in surveillance
   system to cover a wider area. Tracking in such systems is generally
   performed in two distinct steps. In the first step, people are
   identified and tracked in the FOV of a single camera. In the second
   step, re-identification of the people is carried out to track them in
   the whole area under surveillance. Various conventional features such as
   clothes and appearance of person have been used to identify peoples in
   the cameras. However, similarity between appearance and clothes of
   people causes unreliable results. Thus, much reliable features are still
   required to increase the ability of tracking system. The aim of this
   paper is to propose a novel algorithm to identify people in a network of
   cameras with disjoints views. In our proposed methodology, according to
   relative size of various parts, human body are divided into three
   portions of head, middle section and lower section. Considering
   histograms of these portions, matching process was done aiming to
   distinguish persons in FOV of cameras. The other main challenge in such
   multi-camera system is to deal with illumination changes and varying
   appearance of people at different camera's view. The cumulative
   brightness transform function (CBTF) was employed to alleviate the
   difficulty of illumination changes. Experiments were conducted in RGB,
   YCbCr and HSV color spaces and it was found that YCbCr color space gives
   a better performance result compared to other color spaces used in this
   work.}},

Abstract = {{Risk is currently considered as a function of hazard and the exposure of
   assets, depending on their vulnerability, on an area within which a
   disaster could occur. However, in France, technological risk management
   is shared between a technician management focused on hazard, where
   assets are identified only from direct exposure, and vulnerability
   assessment of the assets, which are rarely incorporated in their
   entirety. Early studies, which tried to take into account these two
   parts of management, are limited, as a result of incomplete
   identification of assets and their vulnerabilities. An absence or an
   inadequate combination between hazard and the vulnerability of assets is
   also frequently observed. Indeed, they are mainly based on the
   combination of territorial vulnerability through quantification of the
   hazard, which is not unproblematic: the characterisation of the hazard,
   translated into quality criteria in terms of technological hazards, is
   not a linear relation. To solve these problems, a geographical
   information system-based methodology is therefore suggested in this
   study, where hazard perimeters are combined with the vulnerabilities of
   the exposed assets in a qualitative way. It is based on a process that
   uses geospatial operations and a specific semiology to provide an
   efficient mapping of the global risk. This methodology could be applied
   to any kind of territory, hazard and assets, to produce operational and
   useful knowledge of technological risk cartography. It can also be
   considered as a first step to a more global Natech risk assessment,
   since floods may cause severe damages to the local industrial facilities
   and trigger major accidents involving human, material and environmental
   assets.}},

   predecessors and contemporaries (such as Albert the Great and Henry of
   Ghent) discussed the definition of freedom formally, Thomas does not do
   so, nor does he offer a precise account of libertas. Why would Thomas
   avoid this debate? An answer is necessarily tentative, but I argue that
   Thomas wanted to simplify his treatment of the power of choice. In
   addition, he may be convinced that freedom is best understood as
   instantiated within a nature or its powers, making any abstract
   consideration fundamentally unfruitful.}},

Abstract = {{In the past three decades, as writers have grappled with the legacy of
   the Holocaust and its aftermath, figures of the uncanny such as ghosts,
   monsters, and mythic beings have consistently appeared as salient
   metaphors in Holocaust fiction. As symbols of the vexed relationship
   between Jewish past and present, monstrous creatures demand that readers
   examine what it means to be human in a post-Holocaust universe, a
   universe that has exhibited an extreme capacity for inhumanity. This
   essay examines David Grossman's See Under: Love especially its renowned
   first chapter, ``Momik{''}-as one of the most effective Holocaust
   narratives to employ a monster motif. The ``Nazi Beast{''} and eerie
   survivors in the novel self-consciously call into question the
   strategies writers and readers use when wrestling with ideas about
   postwar trauma. By exploring the ethical and aesthetic implications of
   Momik's ``Beast{''} this essay also asks what is gained or lost by using
   such an overdetermined symbol as the monster to grapple with the equally
   problematic constructions of both perpetrators and traumatized
   survivors.}},

Title = {{Content Analysis of Home Energy Audit Reports: Quantitative Methodology
   for Standardization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Home energy assessments or audits help homeowners diagnose and analyze
   the energy use in their homes. Assisted, traditional, and deep levels of
   these audits involve a trained auditor conducting energy analyses on the
   building structure. Findings from these audits are presented to the
   homeowner in a report format. Currently, a variety of content presented
   in the reports is confusing to homeowners. Energy assessments are
   predominantly carried out by technical professionals who may lack
   training and skills to address the voice of the customer, in this case,
   the homeowner. Report content output is served in the traditional
   engineering paradigm of building science and energy engineering problem
   solving. This research uses expert opinion to validate the content that
   is important for presentation in reports by energy professionals. The
   results then provide a basis for examining current industry practice and
   identify new research gaps for further development, particularly in the
   domain of design for human factors. Homeowners are left with little
   decision-making support owing to a lack of understanding or consensus
   among auditors in how to design effective reports. This research uses
   content analysis to quantitatively consolidate subject matter expert
   opinion to identify the essential components in a home energy audit
   report. It is concluded that there are two essential sections: (1) a
   summary of the audit experience, and (2) a summary of recommendations;
   and two essential formatting options: (1) building photographs, and (2)
   numbers presented in actual units. Adding specialization or
   personalization is useful, but only with the knowledge of homeowner
   motivators, expectations, and abilities. Providing numerical
   consolidation of audit report content increases the consistency of
   quality in the home energy auditing process, customized report design,
   and generation of formats. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of trisomies 18 and

   population-based registries in 16 European countries provided data from
   2000-2011. Cases included live births, fetal deaths (20+ weeks'
   gestation), and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFAs).
   The prevalence of associated anomalies was reported in live births. The
   prevalence of trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 were 4.8 (95\% CI: 4.7-5.0) and
   1.9 (95\% CI: 1.8-2.0) per 10,000 total births. Seventy three percent of
   cases with trisomy 18 or trisomy 13 resulted in a TOPFA. Amongst 468
   live born babies with trisomy 18, 80\% (76-83\%) had a cardiac anomaly,
   21\% (17-25\%) had a nervous system anomaly, 8\% (6-11\%) had esophageal
   atresia and 10\% (8-13\%) had an orofacial cleft. Amongst 240 Live born

Abstract = {{Multicomponent crystals or cocrystals play a significant role in crystal
   engineering, the main objective of which is to understand the role of
   intermolecular interactions and to utilize such understanding in the
   design of novel crystal structures. Molecules possessing carboxylic acid
   and amide functional groups are good candidates for forming cocrystals.
   beta-Resorcylic acid monohydrate, C7H6O4 center dot H2O, (I),
   crystallizes in the triclinic space group P (1) over bar with one
   beta-resorcylic acid molecule and one water molecule in the asymmetric
   unit. The cocrystal thymine-beta-resorcylic acid-water (1/1/1), C5H6N2O2
   center dot C7H6O4 center dot H2O, (II), crystallizes in the orthorhombic
   space group Pca2(1), with one molecule each of thymine, beta-resorcylic
   acid and water in the asymmetric unit. All available donor and acceptor
   atoms in (I) and (II) are utilized for hydrogen bonding. The acid and
   amide functional groups are well known for the formation of
   self-complementary acid-acid and amide-amide homosynthons. In (I), an
   acid-acid homosynthon is observed, while in (II), an amide-acid
   heterosynthon is present. In (I), the beta-resorcylic acid molecule
   exhibits the expected intramolecular S(6) motif between the hydroxy and
   carbonyl O atoms, and an intermolecular R-2(2)(8) dimer motif between
   the carboxylic acid groups; only the former motif is observed in (II).
   The water solvent molecule in (I) propagates the discrete dimers into
   two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded sheets. In (II), thymine and
   beta-resorcylic acid molecules do not form self-complementary
   amide-amide and acid-acid homosynthons; instead, a
   thymine-beta-resorcylic acid heterosynthon is observed. With the help of
   the water molecule, this heterosynthon is aggregated into a
   three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network. The absence of thymine base
   pairing in (II) might be linked to the availability of additional
   functional groups and the preference of the donor and acceptor
   hydrogen-bond combinations.}},

   Nova Cephei 2014 and Nova Scorpii 2015, discovered in outburst on 2014
   March 8.79 UT and 2015 February 11.84 UT, respectively. Nova Cep 2014
   shows the conventional NIR characteristics of a Fe II class nova
   characterized by strong C I, HI and O I lines, whereas Nova Sco 2015 is
   shown to belong to the He/N class with strong He I, HI and O I emission
   lines. The highlight of the results consists in demonstrating that Nova
   Sco 2015 is a symbiotic system containing a giant secondary. Leaving
   aside the T CrB class of recurrent novae, all of which have giant
   donors, Nova Sco 2015 is shown to be only the third classical nova to be
   found with a giant secondary. The evidence for the symbiotic nature is
   threefold; first is the presence of a strong decelerative shock
   accompanying the passage of the nova's ejecta through the giant's wind,
   second is the H alpha excess seen from the system and third is the
   spectral energy distribution of the secondary in quiescence typical of a
   cool late-type giant. The evolution of the strength and shape of the
   emission line profiles shows that the ejecta velocity follows a
   power-law decay with time (t(-1.13 +/- 0.17)). A Case B recombination
   analysis of the H I Brackett lines shows that these lines are affected
   by optical depth effects for both the novae. Using this analysis, we
   make estimates for both the novae of the emission measure n(e)(2)L, the
   electron density n(e) and the mass of the ejecta.}},

   Treatment of PhC= CLi with N, N'-diorganocarbodiimides, R-N= C= N-R (R =
   Pr-i, Cy (cyclohexyl)), in THF or diethyl ether solution afforded the
   lithium-propiolamidinates Li{[}Ph-C= C-C(NCy)(2)] S (1: R = iPr, S =
   THF; 2: R = Cy, S = THF; 3: R = Cy, S = Et2O). Single-crystal X-ray
   diffraction studies of 1 and 2 showed the presence of typical
   ladder-type dimeric structures in the solid state. Reactions of
   anhydrous LnCl(3) (Ln = Ce, Nd, Sm or Ho) with 2 in a 1:3 molar ratio in
   THF afforded a series of new homoleptic lanthanide
   tris(propiolamidinate) complexes, {[}Ph-C= C-C(NCy)(2)](3)Ln (4: Ln =
   Ce; 5: Ln = Nd; 6: Ln = Sm; 7: Ln = Ho). The products were isolated in
   moderate to high yields (61\%-89\%) as brightly colored, crystalline
   solids. The chloro-functional neodymium(III)
   bis(cyclopropylethynylamidinate) complex {[}\{c-C3H5-C=
   C-C(NiPr)(2)\}(2)Ln(mu-Cl)(THF)](2) (8) was prepared from NdCl3 and two

   characterized. A new monomeric Ce(III)-diiminophosphinate complex,
   {[}Ph2P(NSiMe3)(2)](2)Ce(mu-Cl)(2)Li(THF)(2) (9), has also been
   synthesized in a similar manner from CeCl3 and two equiv. of
   Li{[}Ph2P(NSiMe3)(2)]. Structurally, this complex resembles the
   well-known ``ate{''} complexes (C5Me5)(2)Ln(mu-Cl)(2)Li(THF)(2).

Abstract = {{Introduction: To evaluate the outcomes of ureteral strictures treatment
   after endoureterotomy using the holmium laser or open/laparoscopic
   surgery.
   Material and methods: From a database of 1101 patients that underwent
   semi-rigid holmium laser ureterolithotripsy from 2003 to 2013, we
   performed a search for patients treated for ureteral stricture.
   Parameters analyzed included patient demographic, stone burden, and
   ureteral stricture characteristics. Treatment included holmium laser
   endoureterotomy for stenosis cm and open/laparoscopic repair for
   stenosis >1 cm or for failed endoscopic treatment. Outcomes and
   complications were assessed. Success was defined as symptom improvement
   and radiographic obstruction resolution.
   Results: Of all the patients, 32 (2.8\%) evolved with ureteral stenosis
   and all had impacted calculi at the time of surgery. Twenty-two patients
   with complete follow up were studied. After a mean follow up of 18.5
   months (range 3-70), the success rates for endoureterotomy and
   open/laparoscopic stricture repair group were 50\% and 82\%,
   respectively. The hospitalization period was significantly shorter for
   patients who had undergone endoureterotomy (2.7 +/- 1.4 days versus 4.8
   +/- 1.4 days; p = 0.003). Only minor complications occurred in both
   groups.
   Conclusion: The rate of ureteral stricture after holmium laser
   ureterolithotripsy for impacted calculi is higher than reported for
   non-impacted stones. Holmium laser endoureterotomy for stenosis shorter
   than 1 cm treated half of the cases. Open/laparoscopic repair had good
   outcomes in cases of longer stenosis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on part of an investigation of fifteen
   second-semester calculus students' understanding of the concept of
   parametric function. Employing APOS theory as our guiding theoretical
   perspective, we offer a genetic decomposition for the concept of
   parametric function, and we explore students' reasoning about an
   invariant relationship between two quantities varying simultaneously
   with respect to a third quantity when described in a real-world problem,
   as such reasoning is important for the study of parametric functions. In
   particular, we investigate students' reasoning about an adaptation of
   the popular bottle problem in which they were asked to graph
   relationships between (a) time and volume of the water, (b) time and
   height of the water, and (c) volume and height of the water. Our results
   illustrate that several issues make reasoning about relationships
   between variables a complex task. Furthermore, our findings indicate
   that conceiving an invariant relationship, as it relates to the concept
   of parametric function, is nontrivial, and various complimentary ways of
   reasoning are favorable for developing such a conception. We conclude by
   making connections between our results and our genetic decomposition.

Abstract = {{Ecological adaptation is the driving force during divergence with gene
   flow and generates reproductive isolation early in speciation. Although
   gene flow opposes divergence, local adaptation can be facilitated by
   factors that prevent the breakup of favorable allelic combinations. We
   investigated how selection, genetic architecture, and geography have
   contributed to the maintenance of floral trait divergence and pollinator
   isolation between parapatric ecotypes of Mimulus aurantiacus. Combining
   greenhouse, field, and genomic studies, we show that sharp clines in
   floral traits are maintained by spatially varying selection. Although
   adaptation breaks down where the ecotypes co-occur, leading to the
   formation of a hybrid zone, the largely non-overlapping distributions of
   the ecotypes shield them from immigrant genes, facilitating divergence
   across most of the range. In contrast to the sharp genetic
   discontinuities observed across most hybrid zones, we observed a gradual
   cline in genome-wide divergence and a pattern of isolation by distance
   across the landscape. Thus, contrary to a long period of allopatry
   followed by recent re-contact, our data suggest that floral trait
   divergence in M. aurantiacus may have evolved with locally restricted,
   but ongoing gene flow. Therefore, our study reveals how the geographic
   distribution of an organism can contribute to the evolution of premating
   isolation in the early stages of divergence with gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{Armed conflict causes massive displacement, erodes the social fabric of
   communities, and threatens the healthy development of a nation's future
   its youth. Although more than half of the world's registered refugees
   under the age of eighteen currently reside in urban areas, research on
   the unique needs of and realities experienced by this population remain
   limited. In Uganda, as in many refugee-receiving countries, most
   regulated refugee protections and entitlements fail to extend beyond the
   confines of official settlements or camps. This dearth of support, in
   combination with few material resources, uncertain local connections,
   and little knowledge of the language, leaves refugee families vulnerable
   to the added burden of an unwelcome reception in cities. Drawing on
   qualitative data from a study conducted in March and April 2013 with
   Congolese and Somali adolescents, caregivers, and service providers in
   refugee settlements in Kampala, this manuscript explores the pervasive
   nature of discrimination against urban refugees and its effects upon
   adolescent well-being. Findings suggest that discrimination not only
   negatively impacts acculturation as youth pursue social recognition in
   the classroom and among neighborhood peers, but it also impedes
   help-seeking behavior by caregivers and restricts their ability to
   ameliorate protection concerns, thereby lowering adolescents'
   psychosocial well-being. Youth reported low self-worth, withdrawal from
   school, and an adverse turn toward street connections. Targeted and
   innovative strategies along with reformed policies that address the
   unique challenges facing urban refugees are paramount to ensuring that
   young people in this population experience greater protection,
   well-being, and future success. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional network generation models aim to replicate global structural
   properties observed on various real-world networks through synthetic
   link formation mechanisms such as triadic closure or preferential
   attachment. Nowadays, the large amount of data available allow to study
   more precisely the link formation processes and to compare models with
   real situations. In this work, we analyze the network formed by the
   communication activities of the users of a telephony operator for
   studying the link formation process. Our goal is to identify the
   underlying formation mechanisms and checking if they match those
   proposed in traditional models. Indeed, the communications emitted and
   received by users are strong indicators for understanding the underlying
   patterns of the link formation process and highlighting how some
   individual properties induce the formation process in such a network. In
   a first study conducted at a global level, we show that the traditional
   mechanisms commonly used in network generation models cannot reproduce
   alone the link formation in this network. In a second study, we adopt a
   new point of view and analyze locally the link formation process by
   searching for correlations between some user attributes and the
   formation of the new links. The results obtained show that a very strong
   percentage of new links are formed between individuals with strong
   similarity.}},

Abstract = {{Exchange spin coupling is usually evaluated in quantum chemistry from
   the energy difference between a high-spin determinant and a
   Broken-Symmetry (BS) determinant in combination with Kohn Sham density
   functional theory (KS-DFT), based on the work of Noodleman. As an
   alternative, an efficient approximate approach relying on Green's
   functions has been developed by one of the authors. This approach stems
   from solid-state physics and has never been systematically tested for
   molecular systems. We rederive a version of the Green's-function
   approach originally suggested by Han, Ozaki, and Yu. This new derivation
   employs local projection operators as common in quantum chemistry for
   defining local properties such as partial charges, rather than using a
   dual basis as in the Han Ozaki Yu approach. The result is a simple
   postprocessing procedure for KS-DFT calculations, which in contrast to
   the BS energy-difference approach requires the electronic structure of
   only one spin state. We show for several representative small molecules,
   diradicals, and dinuclear transition metal complexes that this method
   gives qualitatively consistent results with the BS energy-difference
   approach as long as it is applied to high-spin determinants and as long
   as structural relaxation effects in different spin states do not play an
   important role.}},

Abstract = {{Orthogonal Latin hypercubes (OLHs) are available for only a limited
   collection of run sizes. This paper presents a simple algorithm for
   constructing orthogonal designs that are nearly Latin hypercubes. The
   algorithm is based on the approach developed by Steinberg and Lin for
   OLH designs and can generate designs for all run sizes for which a
   Plackett-Burman design exists. The designs have good univariate
   projections, although they are not perfectly uniform. They also provide
   good spatial coverage in higher dimensions. The great gain in sample
   size flexibility requires just a small sacrifice in the univariate
   spread of points. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{The effect of liver disease on lactate normalization in severe sepsis
   and septic shock: a cohort study}},

Abstract = {{Objective To describe the effect of liver disease (LD) on lactate
   clearance during early sepsis resuscitation.
   Methods This is a multicenter randomized clinical trial. An initial
   lactate > 2 mmol/L and subsequent serum lactate measurement within 6
   hours were required for inclusion. LD was categorized by two methods: 1)
   past medical history (PMH) categorized as no LD, mild LD (no Child's
   score criteria, but PMH of hepatitis B/C), cirrhosis; and 2) measurable
   liver dysfunction determined by the liver component of the sequential
   organ failure assessment (L-SOFA) score as no dysfunction (L-SOFA score
   0), mild dysfunction (score 1), moderate-severe dysfunction (score 2 to
   4). Primary outcome was the rate of lactate normalization.
   Results One hundred eighty-seven patients were included. When
   categorized by PMH, 169 patients had no LD, 6 mild LD, and 12 cirrhosis.
   63/169 (37\%) of patients with no LD achieved lactate normalization,
   compared to 4/6 (67\%) with mild LD, and 1/12 (8\%) with cirrhosis (P <
   0.03). Categorized by L-SOFA score, 59/124 (47\%) patients with L-SOFA 0
   achieved lactate normalization, compared to 6/31 (19\%) with L-SOFA 1,
   and 3/32 (9\%) with L-SOFA 2-4 (P < 0.01). Relative lactate clearance
   {[}(initial lactate-subsequent lactate)/initial lactate] was lower in
   patients with more advanced LD by PMH (37.7 vs. 40.4 vs. 21.8, P =
   0.07), and lower with increasing L-SOFA score (42.0 vs. 30.1 vs. 23.4, P
   = 0.01).
   Conclusion Liver dysfunction was significantly associated with impaired
   lactate clearance and normalization during the early resuscitation of
   sepsis.}},
