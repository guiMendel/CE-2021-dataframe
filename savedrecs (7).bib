Abstract = {{Coenzyme Q(10/)COQ(10), an essential cofactor in the electron-transport
   chain is involved in ATP production. Primary COQ(10) deficiency is
   clinically and genetically a heterogeneous group of mitochondrial
   disorders caused by defects in the COQ(10) synthesis pathway. Its mode
   of inheritance is autosomal recessive and it is characterized by
   metabolic abnormalities and multisystem involvement including
   neurological features. Mutations in 10 genes have been identified
   concerning this group of diseases, so far. Among those, variants of the
   COQ7 gene are very rare and confined to three patients with Asian
   ancestry. Here, we present the clinical features and results of
   whole-exome sequencing (WES) of three Iranian unrelated families
   affected by primary COQ(10) deficiency. Three homozygous variants in
   COQ2, COQ4, and COQ7 genes were identified. Candidate variants of the
   COQ2 and COQ4 genes were novel and associated with the cerebellar signs
   and multisystem involvement, whereas, the known variant in COQ7 was
   associated with a mild phenotype that was initially diagnosed as
   hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). This variant has already been
   reported in a Canadian girl with similar presentations that also
   originated from Iran suggesting both patients may share a common
   ancestor. Due to extensive heterogeneity in this group of disorders, and
   overlap with other mitochondrial/neurological disorders, WES may be
   helpful to distinguish primary coenzyme Q(10) deficiency from other
   similar conditions. Given that some features of primary coenzyme Q(10)
   deficiency may improve with exogenous COQ(10), early diagnosis is very
   important.}},

Title = {{The Association Between Suicide-Related Media Coverage and Suicide: A
   Cross-Sectional Observational Study}},
Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF SUICIDE RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   To examine the association between the publication and content of
   suicide-related media reports and actual suicide in Noord Brabant, a
   province of the Netherlands.
   Method
   Between April 2017 and March 2018, a retrospective cross-sectional
   observational study was conducted on suicide-related media reports and
   incident data regarding suicides. Linear regression, Mann-Whitney U and
   negative binomial regression analyses were conducted.
   Results
   In Noord-Brabant, a total of 352 people died from suicide during the
   observation period and 440 reports were identified by using the search
   terms ``suicide{''}, ``self-killing{''}, and ``self-murder{''}. No
   associations between media reports and actual suicides were found for
   any of the analyses performed.
   Conclusions
   No indications were found for an association between media coverage of
   suicide and increases or decreases in actual suicides in Noord-Brabant.
   The descriptive statistics of this study reveal that the regional and
   national Dutch media are doing well with respect to not including
   elements in their reports that could encourage copycat behavior, such as
   simplifying, romanticizing or dramatizing. They could improve on
   including protective content, for example, providing supportive
   background information. A recommendation for further research is to
   evaluate causal relationships between media and actual suicide. A
   stepped wedge trial might be needed, as this provides an ethical
   research design to investigate this issue in a controlled setting. Also,
   in such a study, other variables influencing the decision to attempt
   suicide should be taken into account as much as possible.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Despite high incidence of depression after stroke, few trials
   have investigated the therapeutic efficacy of repetitive transcranial
   magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Here, we aimed to evaluate clinical benefit
   of delivering a higher dose of rTMS compared to previous stroke trials.
   Secondary aims were to document adverse effects and investigate the role
   of functional connectivity as a potential mechanism of clinical response
   to rTMS treatment. Methods Eleven chronic stroke survivors were
   recruited to a double-blind, Sham-controlled, randomised trial to
   investigate 10 sessions of high-frequency rTMS for depression. Clinical
   assessments were obtained at baseline, after treatment and a 1-month
   follow-up. Adverse events were documented at completion of the
   treatment. Resting electroencephalography recordings were performed at
   baseline and after treatment to estimate functional connectivity.
   Results There were no differences in baseline characteristics between
   groups (all p >= 0.42). Beck Depression Inventory scores decreased for
   the Active rTMS group from baseline to 1-month follow-up (p = 0.04), but
   did not change for the Sham group at post-treatment or follow-up (p >=
   0.17). Stronger theta frequency functional connectivity between the left
   frontal cortex and right parietal cortex was associated with lower
   baseline depression (r = - 0.71, p = 0.05). This network strength
   increased following Active rTMS, with change in connectivity associated
   with improvement in BDI scores (r = 0.98, p = 0.001). Adverse events
   were transient and minor and were not statistically different between
   groups (p >= 0.21). Conclusions Active rTMS significantly improved
   depression and was well tolerated. The mechanistic role of theta
   frequency functional connectivity appears worthy of further
   investigation. The trial was registered on the Australian and New
   Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12619001303134) on September 23,
   2019.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is the primary feature of obstructive
   sleep apnoea (OSA), a crucial risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.
   Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in myocardial infarction (MI)
   pathogenesis have drawn considerable attention. However, whether CIH
   participates in the modulation of lncRNA profiles during MI is yet
   unclear. To investigate the influence of CIH on MI, cardiac damage was
   assessed by histology and echocardiography, and lncRNA and mRNA
   integrated microarrays were screened. MI mouse model showed myocardial
   hypertrophy, aggravated inflammation and fibrosis, and compromised left
   ventricle function under CIH. Compared with normoxia, 644 lncRNAs and
   1084 differentially expressed mRNAs were identified following CIH for 4
   weeks, whereas 1482 lncRNAs and 990 mRNAs were altered at 8 weeks.
   Strikingly, reoxygenation after CIH markedly affected 1759 lncRNAs and
   778 mRNAs. Of these, 11 lncRNAs modulated by CIH were restored after
   reoxygenation and were validated by qPCR. The GO terms and KEGG pathways
   of genes varied significantly by CIH. lncRNA-mRNA correlation further
   showed that lncRNAs, NONMMUT032513 and NONMMUT074571 were positively
   correlated with ZEB1 and negatively correlated with Cmbl. The current
   results demonstrated a causal correlation between CIH and lncRNA
   alternations during MI, suggesting that lncRNAs might be responsible for
   MI aggravation under CIH.}},

Abstract = {{Structural diversity of a user in a social network is the number of
   social contexts in his/her contact neighborhood. The problem of
   structural diversity search is to find the top-k vertices with the
   largest structural diversity in a graph. However, when identifying
   distinct social contexts, existing structural diversity models (e.g.,
   t-sized component, t-core, and t-brace) are sensitive to an input
   parameter of t. To address this drawback, we propose a parameter-free
   structural diversity model. Specifically, we propose a novel notation of
   discriminativecore, which automatically models various kinds of social
   contexts without parameter t. Leveraging on discriminativecores and
   h-index, the structural diversity score for a vertex is calculated. We
   study the problem of parameter-free structural diversity search in this
   paper. An efficient top-k search algorithm with a well-designed upper
   bound for pruning is proposed. To further speed up the computation, we
   design a novel parallel algorithm for efficient top-k search over large
   graphs. The parallel algorithm computes diversity scores for a batch of
   vertices simultaneously using multi-threads. Extensive experiment
   results demonstrate the parameter sensitivity of existing t-core based
   model and verify the superiority of our methods.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed spatio-temporal information about geographic distributions of
   species is critical for biodiversity analyses in conservation and
   planning. Traditional correlative modelling approaches use species
   observational data in model calibration and testing in a time-averaged
   framework. This method averages environmental values through time to
   yield a single environmental value for each location. Although valuable
   for exploring distributions of species at a broad level, this averaging
   is one of myriad factors impacting model quality and reliability.
   We sought to optimize traditional correlative niche model performance in
   distributional ecology contexts by incorporating time specificity into
   the existing modelling framework. We modified the existing framework to
   account for temporal dynamics in species' distributions to produce more
   robust, temporally explicit models. Using the Wood Thrush Hylostichla
   mustelina as our study species, we introduce a method of (a) deriving a
   temporally explicit pseudo-absence dataset using kernel density
   estimates to replicate relative sampling of sites through time, and (b)
   incorporating temporally explicit covariates in model calibration.
   By accounting for location, and month and year of primary data
   collection, the time-specific models successfully yielded dynamic
   predictions reflecting known distributional shifts in Hylocichla
   mustelina's annual movement pattern.
   The modified data preparation steps that we present incorporate temporal
   dimensions into traditional correlational modelling approaches improving
   predictive capacity and overall utility of these models for highly
   mobile, short-lived or behaviourally complex species. With the ability
   to estimate species' niches in greater detail, time-specific models will
   be able to address specific concerns of species-level management and
   policy development for highly mobile and/or migratory species, as well
   as disease vectors of public health interest.}},

Abstract = {{The historical anthropogenic impact on sediments from the Basque Mud
   Patch (southern Bay of Biscay) is explored using a multidisciplinary
   approach including the analysis of natural (Pb-210) and artificial
   (Cs-137, Pu-239/240) radiotracers, major elements (Al, Mn), metals (Zn,
   Pb, Cu, Cr), Pb isotopic ratios, and foraminiferal and pollen contents.
   The study of three short cores (19-46 cm), despite being hindered by the
   effects of biomixing, allow the calculation of a sedimentation rate of 1
   +/- 0.1 mm yr(-1). Distribution with depth of Al-normalised
   concentrations of metals reflects an increasing trend since 1880 CE,
   related to the industrialization of the Basque coastal area. According
   to the Sediment Quality Guidelines applied, contents of Zn and Pb appear
   as a potential cause of concern, given that they exceed the values from
   which adverse biological effects can be occasionally expected. However,
   foraminiferal assemblages do not show recognizable changes along the
   cores following increasing trace metal concentrations. Finally, pollen
   results reveal an increasing trend of coniferous taxa and a parallel
   reduction of authochthonous Deciduous Quercus, probably as a consequence
   of reforestation works. Data obtained confirm that effects of coastal
   anthropogenic activities extend to the adjacent shelf, where muddy
   deposits are likely to act as a trap for contaminants.yy}},

Abstract = {{AIMS: Damage control resuscitation with limited crystalloids and early
   use of blood products is now considered standard care in major trauma.
   The purpose of this study was to audit resuscitation practice in trauma
   patients where a massive transfusion protocol (MTP) had been activated,
   to determine whether crystalloid administration and adherence to the MTP
   had improved since an audit and education sessions in July 2017.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study looking at trauma patients
   presenting to Christchurch Hospital who had a MTP activated form the 1
   May 2016 to 1 March 2019. Patients were identified by crossreferencing
   the trauma call database with the electronic transfusion registry.
   RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were included in the audit. There was no
   significant difference in mean crystalloid administration before and
   after July 2017 (5.74 litres and 4.86 litres respectively). Patients
   presenting before July 2017 received a significantly lower mean fresh
   frozen plasma to red blood cells (FFP:RBC) compared to patients after
   July 2017.
   CONCLUSIONS: Trauma patients with major haemorrhage at Christchurch
   Hospital are still receiving excess crystalloids; however, our audit
   suggests that compliance with the MTP has improved. Further education
   involving the entire trauma team is required to improve fluid
   resuscitation practice.}},

Title = {{Swedish Gynecologists' Positioning in Relation to Clitoral
   Reconstruction After Female Genital Cutting. A Qualitative Interview
   Study}},

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Background: Clitoral reconstruction (CR) is surgical reparation of the
   clitoris cut as part of the practice of female genital cutting (FGC)
   available in a handful of countries, including Sweden. The surgery aims
   at restoring the clitoris esthetically and functionally, thus has
   implications for sexual health. Gynaecological examinations can be an
   opportunity for dialogue regarding women's sexual health. Gynecologist
   play a role in referring patients experiencing FGC-related problems,
   including sexual, to specialist services such as CR. Aim: The aim of
   this study was to explore how gynecologists position themselves in
   relation to CR. Method: Eight gynecologists were interviewed using
   semi-structured interviews. The interviews were tape-recorded,
   transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: The
   gynecologists positioned themselves in three different ways in relation
   CR; outright negative, uncertain or positive toward the surgery. Those
   positioning themselves as negative thought CR was a harmful fraud and
   denied any possible benefits, at least sufficient for referral for CR.
   Those positioning themselves as uncertain did not deny possible
   benefits, but were skeptical toward CR improving cut women's sexual
   health and function. Those positioning themselves positive considered
   the potential physical, psychological/emotional, esthetic, or symbolic
   aspects of CR as important for general well-being and sexual health.
   Conclusion: There was a great variety in how the gynecologists
   positioned themselves toward CR, and many were skeptical toward the
   functional benefits in relation to sexual health. This is likely to
   diverge cut women's access to CR surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Background Graft primary non-function (PNF) is the most severe
   complication after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and is
   frequently associated with livers from uncontrolled circulatory death
   (uDCD).
   Methods We reviewed retrospectively the incidence, risk factors, and
   outcome of patients showing PNF after receiving uDCD liver grafts. The
   series comprises 75 OLT performed during 11 years.
   Results The incidence of PNF using uDCD livers was 8\%. We compared
   patients who developed PNF (n = 6) vs. patients without PNF (n = 69).
   Mean pump flow of donors during normothermic regional perfusion (NRP)
   was significantly lower in PNF (p = .032). Day 1 post-OLT levels of
   transaminases and the incidence of renal complications and postoperative
   mortality were also significantly higher in the PNF group, but 5-year
   patient survival was similar in both groups (66.7\% in PNF and 68.5\% in
   non-PNF). All PNF patients underwent re-OLT, and 2 died. PNF incidence
   has decreased in the last 5-years. Binary logistic regression analysis
   confirmed final ALT value >4 times the normal value as risk factor for
   PNF, and median donor pump flow >3700 ml/min as protective effect.
   Conclusions Adequate donor pump flow during NRP was a protective.}},

Journal = {{SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: South Africa has not fully recovered from the 2008 global
   recession. The World Bank has predicted that South Africa will be one of
   the worst performers in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020 with tepid growth of
   1.3\% which is far below the National Development Plan targets growth of
   5.4\% required a year to reduce unemployment, create decent jobs and
   generate enough revenue for social development.
   Aim: We aim to examine whether changes in the components of final demand
   (changes in government spending, household consumption expenditure,
   exports, investment spending) have a considerable effect on the sector's
   gross value added, job creation and tax revenue generation and whether
   there were changes in the exogenous final demand in die post-recession
   period.
   Setting: We focus on building supply and use tables based on 62
   different sectors of the South African economy.
   Methods: An economy-wide Leontief multiplier-based model calibrated on a
   supply and use framework and a micro-simulation model is used to assess
   post-recession trends in macroeconomic, labour and fiscal multipliers
   for South Africa.
   Results: The simulations show that during the post-recession era, the
   effect of exogenous shock in the economy, like an increase in investment
   spending, although positive, yields a smaller return in terms of tax
   revenue, job creation and economic growth. At sector level, the results
   show that the inter-industry links and industry-consumer links have
   therefore weakened.
   Conclusion: Our findings imply that the persisting low growth trajectory
   associated with weaker inter-industry linkages could be exacerbated,
   while the fiscal austerity measures associated with weaker forward and
   backword tax linkages could be prolonged. We recommend government should
   follow a priorities-based spending policy that yields optimal
   socioeconomic returns.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication of highly reactive and cost-effective electrode materials is
   a key to efficient functioning of green energy technologies. Decorating
   redox-active metal sulfides with conductive dopants is one of the most
   effective approaches to enhance electric conductivity and consequently
   boost capacitive properties. Herein, hierarchically hollow
   Ag2S-NiCo(2)S(4)architectures are designed with an enhanced conductivity
   by a simple solvothermal approach. With the favorable porous
   characteristics and composition, the optimized Ag2S-NiCo2S4-5 electrode
   exhibits higher specific capacitance (276.5 mAh g(-1)at a current
   density of 1 A g(-1)), a good rate performance (56.3\% capacity
   retention at 50 A g(-1)), and an improved cycling stability (92.4\%
   retention after 2000 cycles). This finding originates from the enhanced
   charge transportation ability within the hierarchical structure,
   abundant electroactive sites, and low contact resistance. In addition, a
   battery supercapacitor device constructed with the Ag2S-NiCo2S4-5 as a
   positive electrode displays a maximum energy density of 63.3Wh kg(-1)at
   an energy density of 821.8 W kg(-1)with an excellent cycling stability
   (89.4\% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles). Therefore, the present
   work puts forward new possibility to develop composite electrodes for
   energy storage battery-supercapacitor.}},

Title = {{A Generalist Lifestyle Allows Rare Gardnerella spp. to Persist at Low
   Levels in the Vaginal Microbiome}},
Journal = {{MICROBIAL ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Gardnerella spp. are considered a hallmark of bacterial vaginosis, a
   dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiome. There are four cpn60 sequence-based
   subgroups within the genus (A, B, C and D), and thirteen genome species
   have been defined recently. Gardnerella spp. co-occur in the vaginal
   microbiome with varying abundance, and these patterns are shaped by a
   resource-dependent, exploitative competition, which affects the growth
   rate of subgroups A, B and C negatively. The growth rate of rarely
   abundant subgroup D, however, increases with the increasing number of
   competitors, negatively affecting the growth rate of others. We
   hypothesized that a nutritional generalist lifestyle and minimal niche
   overlap with the other more abundant Gardnerella spp. facilitate the
   maintenance of subgroup D in the vaginal microbiome through negative
   frequency-dependent selection. Using 40 whole-genome sequences from
   isolates representing all four subgroups, we found that they could be
   distinguished based on the content of their predicted proteomes.
   Proteins associated with carbohydrate and amino acid uptake and
   metabolism were significant contributors to the separation of subgroups.
   Subgroup D isolates had significantly more of their proteins assigned to
   amino acid metabolism than the other subgroups. Subgroup D isolates were
   also significantly different from others in terms of number and type of
   carbon sources utilized in a phenotypic assay, while the other three
   could not be distinguished. Overall, the results suggest that a
   generalist lifestyle and lack of niche overlap with other Gardnerella
   spp. leads to subgroup D being favoured by negative frequency-dependent
   selection in the vaginal microbiome.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This study aimed to assess the impact of overactive bladder on
   health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a community-based sample of
   Korean population. Methods The data of adults aged 19 and over that who
   participated in the 2012 Korean Community Health Survey were analyzed.
   Overactive bladder severity was classified as normal, mild, moderate, or
   severe using the Overactive Bladder Symptom scores, and HRQoL was
   evaluated using EQ-5D-3L. Relations between HRQoL and the severities and
   symptoms of OAB were investigated. Sampling weighted adjusted multiple
   regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of OAB symptom
   severity on HRQoL. Results Of the 226,867 study subjects, 12,303 (5.4\%)
   had OAB, and 552 (0.2\%) had an OABSS of >= 12, indicating severe OAB.
   The problem -reporting rate significantly increased in all EQ-5D-3L
   dimensions as OAB severity increased. After adjusting for other
   variables, OAB severity had a significant effect on EQ-5D-3L index. Urge
   incontinence had greatest impact on quality of life. Conclusions As the
   severity of OAB increased from mild to severe, quality of life decreased
   significantly. OAB was found to negatively affect HRQoL.}},

Abstract = {{Pathology reports contain the essential data for both clinical and
   research purposes. However, the extraction of meaningful, qualitative
   data from the original document is difficult due to the narrative and
   complex nature of such reports. Keyword extraction for pathology reports
   is necessary to summarize the informative text and reduce intensive time
   consumption. In this study, we employed a deep learning model for the
   natural language process to extract keywords from pathology reports and
   presented the supervised keyword extraction algorithm. We considered
   three types of pathological keywords, namely specimen, procedure, and
   pathology types. We compared the performance of the present algorithm
   with the conventional keyword extraction methods on the 3115 pathology
   reports that were manually labeled by professional pathologists.
   Additionally, we applied the present algorithm to 36,014 unlabeled
   pathology reports and analysed the extracted keywords with biomedical
   vocabulary sets. The results demonstrated the suitability of our model
   for practical application in extracting important data from pathology
   reports.}},

Title = {{A Close Relationship Between Networks of Interstitial Cells of Cajal and
   Gastrointestinal Transit In Vivo}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{The interstitial cells of Cajal associated with the myenteric plexus
   (ICC-MP) are located in the same area as the myenteric plexus. ICC-MP
   networks are linked to the generation of electrical pacemaker activity
   that causes spontaneous gastrointestinal (GI) contractions; however, its
   role in GI transit is not clear. The aim of this study was to
   comprehensively investigate the effect of ICC-MP disruption on GI
   transit in vivo using W/W
   (v) mice, partially ICC-deficient model mice. In this study, we measured
   GI transit using a C-13-octanoic acid breath test, an orally
   administered dye and a bead expulsion assay. ICC were detected by
   immunohistochemical staining for c-Kit, a specific marker for ICC.
   Interestingly, we found that gastric emptying in W/W
   (v) mice was normal. We also found that the ability of small intestinal
   and colonic transit was significantly reduced in W/W
   (v) mice. Immunohistochemical staining using whole-mount muscularis
   samples revealed that c-Kit-positive ICC-MP networks were formed in
   wild-type mice. In contrast, ICC-MP networks in W/W
   (v) mice were maintained only in the gastric antrum and were
   significantly reduced in the ileum and colon. No significant changes
   were observed in the nerve structures of the myenteric plexus in W/W
   (v) mice. These findings suggest that ICC-MP contribute to GI transit as
   a powerful driving function in vivo.}},

Volume = {{102}},

Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{The interplay of time-reversal and n-fold rotation symmetries (n = 2, 4,
   6) is known to bring a new class of topological crystalline insulators
   (TCIs) having n surface Dirac cones due to a surface rotation anomaly.
   We show that the proximity-induced s-wave superconductivity on the
   surface of these TCIs yields a topological superconducting phase in
   which two Majorana zero modes are bound to a vortex, and that n-fold
   rotation symmetry (n = 2, 4, 6) enriches the topological classification
   of a superconducting vortex from Z(2) to Z(2) x Z(2). Using a model of a
   three-dimensional high-spin topological insulator with s-wave
   superconductivity and twofold rotation symmetry, we show that, with
   increasing chemical potential, the number of Majorana zero modes at one
   end of a vortex changes as 2 -> 1 -> 0 through two topological vortex
   phase transitions. In addition, we show that additional magnetic-mirror
   symmetry further enhances the topological classification to Z x Z.}},

Abstract = {{We have demonstrated the feasibility and ease of producing quercetin
   radicals by photoionization with a pulsed 355 nm laser. A conversion
   efficiency into radicals of 0.4 is routinely achieved throughout the pH
   range investigated (pH 2-9), and the radical generation is completed
   within a few ns. No precursor other than the parent compound is needed,
   and the ionization by-products do not interfere with the further fate of
   the radicals. With this generation method, we have characterized the
   quercetin radicals and studied the kinetics of their repairs by
   co-antioxidants such as ascorbate and 4-aminophenol. Bell-shaped pH
   dependences of the observed rate constants reflect opposite trends in
   the availability of the reacting protonation forms of radical and
   co-antioxidant and even at their maxima mask the much higher true rate
   constants. Kinetic isotope effects identify the repairs as
   proton-coupled electron transfers. An examination of which
   co-antioxidants are capable of repairing the quercetin radicals and
   which are not confines the bond dissociation energies of quercetin and
   its monoanion experimentally to 75-77 kcal mol(-1) and 72-75 kcal
   mol(-1), a much narrower interval in the case of the former than
   previously estimated by theoretical calculations.}},

Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2907-2915}},

Abstract = {{The success of phage display, used for developing target-specific
   binders based on peptides and proteins, depends on the size and
   diversity of the library screened, but generating large libraries of
   phage-encoded polypeptides remains challenging. New peptide phage
   display libraries developed in recent years rarely contained more than 1
   billion clones, which appears to have become the upper size limit for
   libraries generated with reasonable effort. Here, we established a
   strategy based on whole-plasmid PCR and self-ligation to clone a library
   with more than 2 x 10(10) members. The enormous library size could be
   obtained through amplifying the entire vector DNA by PCR, which omitted
   the step of vector isolation from bacterial cells, and through appending
   DNA coding for the peptide library via a PCR primer, which enabled
   efficient DNA circularization by end-ligation to facilitate the
   difficult step of vector-insertion of DNA fragments. Panning the peptide
   repertoires against a target yielded high-affinity ligands and validated
   the quality of the library and thus the new library cloning strategy.
   This simple and efficient strategy places larger libraries within reach
   for nonspecialist researchers to hopefully expand the possible targets
   of phage display applications.}},

Title = {{Alzheimer Cells on Their Way to Derailment Show Selective Changes in
   Protein Quality Control Network}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Alzheimer's Disease is driven by protein aggregation and is
   characterized by accumulation of Tau protein into neurofibrillary
   tangles. In healthy neurons the cellular protein quality control is
   successfully in charge of protein folding, which raises the question to
   which extent this control is disturbed in disease. Here, we describe
   that brain cells in Alzheimer's Disease show very specific derailment of
   the protein quality control network. We performed a meta-analysis on the
   Alzheimer's Disease Proteome database, which provides a quantitative
   assessment of disease-related proteome changes in six brain regions in
   comparison to age-matched controls. We noted that levels of all paralogs
   of the conserved Hsp90 chaperone family are reduced, while most other
   chaperones - or their regulatory co-chaperones - do not change in
   disease. The notable exception is a select group consisting of the
   stress inducible HSP70, its nucleotide exchange factor BAG3 - which
   links the Hsp70 system to autophagy - and neuronal small heat shock
   proteins, which are upregulated in disease. They are all members of a
   cascade controlled in the stress response, channeling proteins towards a
   pathway of chaperone assisted selective autophagy. Together, our
   analysis reveals that in an Alzheimer's brain, with exception of Hsp90,
   the players of the protein quality control are still present in full
   strength, even in brain regions most severely affected in disease. The
   specific upregulation of small heat shock proteins and HSP70:BAG3,
   ubiquitous in all brain areas analyzed, may represent a last,
   unsuccessful attempt to advert cell death.}},

Title = {{A collaborative strategy for detection and eviction of Sybil attacker
   and Sybil nodes in VANET}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a part of the intelligent
   transportation system (ITS) that provides safety and nonsafety
   applications. The high mobility of vehicles and the wireless
   communication environment in VANET makes it vulnerable to various
   attacks. One among them is the Sybil attack, where a Sybil attacker
   creates multiple fake identities called Sybil nodes that disrupt the
   functionality of VANET. Most of the existing solutions in the literature
   discuss identifying the Sybil nodes (virtual); very few works exist to
   determine the Sybil attacker (source node that generates Sybil nodes).
   In this paper, we propose a computation less heuristic approach that
   focuses on detecting the Sybil attacker and its Sybil nodes using signal
   strength measurements and Euclidean distance as the detection
   parameters. The central VANET server, Road Side Units (RSUs), and
   vehicles collaborate in the detection process, which improves the
   accuracy of our approach. The core of the approach is a reward-based
   system, where the vehicle rewards are determined by collecting RSUs'
   feedback about the vehicle behavior. From simulation experiments, it is
   evident that our proposed approach achieves a maximum detection rate of
   99.89\% and a false positive rate of 0.012\% than the existing
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{alpha-Branched amines represent essential building blocks for organic
   synthesis. They are traditionally prepared through nucleophilic addition
   to imines. These methods often require highly reactive organometallic
   reagents and proceed under rigorous air- and moisture-free conditions.
   Here we describe an alternative approach that involves a C-alkylation of
   amines with alkyl bromides. Mechanistically, the reaction likely
   involves photocatalytic generation of an alpha-amino radical and a
   stabilized carbon-centered radical (allyl, benzyl, alpha-carbonyl)
   followed by radical recombination. This approach offers a mild,
   atom-economical, redox neutral synthesis of alpha-branched amines that
   shows broad scope and avoids premetalated reagents.}},

Title = {{Elliptic flow splitting between protons and antiprotons from hadronic
   potentials}},
Journal = {{MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{35}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{The difference in elliptic flow between protons and antiprotons,
   produced in Au-197 +Au-197 collisions at center-of-mass energies root
   s(NN) = 5-12GeV, is studied within a modified version of the
   ultra-relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model. Two
   different model scenarios are compared: the cascade mode and the mean
   field mode which includes potential interactions for both formed and
   pre-formed hadrons. The model results for the elliptic flow of protons
   and the relative elliptic flow difference between protons and
   antiprotons obtained from the mean field mode agree with the available
   experimental data, while the elliptic flow difference is near zero for
   the cascade mode. Our results show that the elliptic flow splitting,
   observed for particles and antiparticles, can be explained by the
   inclusion of proper hadronic interactions. In addition, the difference
   in elliptic flow between protons and antiprotons depends on the
   centrality and the rapidity window. With smaller centrality and/or
   rapidity acceptance, the observed elliptic flow splitting is more
   sensitive to the beam energy, indicating a strong net baryon density
   dependence of the effect. We propose to confirm this splitting at the
   upcoming experiments from Beam Energy Scan (BES) Phase-II at
   Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), the Compressed Baryonic Matter
   (CBM) at Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR), High Intensity
   heavy ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider

Title = {{Molecular characterization of solitary pulmonary nodules in dual-energy
   CT nonlinear image fusion technology}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RECEPTORS AND SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   To investigate the feasibility and to optimize the parameters of
   nonlinear blending technique in dual-energy CT on solitary pulmonary
   nodules (SPN).
   Methods
   The simulated enhanced SPN were used the mixture of nonionic iodinated
   contrast agent (Iopromide 370mgI/100 ml) and normal saline and then
   randomly placed inside an anthropomorphic chest phantom. The phantom was
   examined on SOMATOM definition flash with dual mode (80/140 kV) and
   single energy mode (120 kV) (the same CTDIvol). Nonlinear blending
   images and linear blending images with a weighting factor of 0.3 were
   generated and the image qualities were analyzed.
   Results
   For different simulated density SPN, when 0 HU was chosen as the
   Blending Center (BC) and 0 to 30 HU were chosen as the Blending width
   (BW), the nonlinear blending images yielded a higher contrast-to-noise
   (CNR). There were significant differences in the image noise and
   signal-to-noise (SNR) of different simulated density SPN at non-linear
   blending images, linear blending images and 120 kV images (p < .05); But
   the differences of CNR between the three groups were not statistically
   significant (p > .05). The SNR of different simulated density SPN at
   non-linear blending images was significantly increased compared with it
   at linear blending images and 120 kV images (p < .05); And the image
   noise at non-linear blending was lower than it at linear blending images
   (p < .05).
   Conclusion
   Nonlinear blending technique in dual-energy CT can increase the SNR of
   enhanced SPN, and it is helpful in diagnosis of SPN.}},

   building damage detection}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},

Abstract = {{Fast assessment of damaged buildings is important for post-disaster
   rescue operations. Building damage detection leveraging image processing
   and machine learning techniques has become a popular research focus in
   recent years. Although supervised learning approaches have made
   considerable improvement for damaged building assessment, rapidly
   deploying supervised classification is still difficult due to the
   complexity in obtaining a large number of labeled samples in the
   aftermath of disasters. We propose an unsupervised self-attention domain
   adaptation (USADA) model, which transforms instances of the source
   domain to those of the target domain in pixel space, to address the
   aforementioned issue. The proposed USADA consists of three parts: a set
   of generative adversarial networks (GANs), a classifier, and a
   self-attention module. The GAN adapts source domain images to ensure
   their similarity to target domain images. Once adapted, the classifier
   can be trained using the adapted images along with the original images
   of the source domain to classify damaged buildings. The self-attention
   module is introduced to maintain the foreground of the generated images
   conditioned on source domain images for generating plausible samples. As
   a case study, aerial images of Hurricane Sandy, Maria, and Irma, are
   used as the source and target domain datasets in our experiments.
   Experimental results demonstrate that classification accuracies of
   68.1\% and 84.1\% are achieved, and our method obtains improvements of
   2.0\% and 3.6\% against pixel-level domain adaptation, which is the
   basis of our model. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the energy absorption performance and
   deformation mechanism of 316L stainless steel (SS316L) triply periodic
   minimal surface (TPMS) cellular structures fabricated by a selective
   laser melting (SLM) technique. The as-built specimens are subjected to
   abrasive blasting treatment to improve the surface quality of the
   printed parts, in order to reveal the true surface and mechanical
   characteristics of the TPMS structures. It is found that the P-type
   structure outperforms the G-type structure with a higher energy
   absorption capability at low relative densities (<0.35). The macroscopic
   examination of these micro-architectures reveals that the P-type
   structure develops a rapid local cell deformation following the diagonal
   shear geometry on the face sheet, whereas the G-type structure
   experiences continuous strain hardening along the stress plateau and
   deforms in a gradual manner during compression. The apparent strain
   hardening effect of the G-type structure is caused by the development of
   many macro-localities with extreme geometry distortion and cell wall
   self-contacting during compression. The findings in this study may
   provide valuable insight into design, fabrication, and post-fabrication
   treatment of metallic TPMS structures for the applications of high
   compression performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the finite-time time-varying formation-containment
   tracking problems for second-order multi-agent systems with directed
   topology, where the multi-agent system consists of one virtual leader
   with fully unknown input, several real leaders and followers. In
   contrast with traditional formation and containment cases studied in
   most of the existing literature, apart from accomplishing the expected
   time-varying formation, the real leaders are required to track the
   trajectory generated by the virtual leader, and the followers need to
   get into the convex envelope spanned by the real leaders in finite time.
   The method for solving the finite-time formation-containment tracking
   problems is divided into the following steps. First, distributed
   finite-time observers are designed for each real leader and follower, in
   order to obtain the estimated states of their neighbor agents. Then,
   formation-containment tracking protocols are presented by using the
   neighboring information for both real leaders and followers.
   Furthermore, based on Lyapunov theory, it is proved that the given
   formation-containment tracking can be realized in finite time by the
   multi-agent system under the designed protocols. Finally, a case study
   on multi-robot transport operation is given to verify the effectiveness
   of the theoretical results. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{C-peptide should be continuously suppressed. However, increased
   postdosing C-peptide is not an uncommon phenomenon in euglycemic clamp
   studies involving healthy participants. This study aimed to determine
   the extent to which the postdosing C-peptide increases from the baseline
   that could affect the accuracy of glucodynamics in euglycemic clamp
   studies involving healthy subjects. First, 10 healthy males underwent a
   10-h euglycemic clamp without exogenous insulin administration to obtain
   a reference interval (RI) for the ratio of C-peptide after 0 min (CPt)
   to baseline C-peptide (CP0). Then, the data from a pharmacokinetic and
   pharmacodynamic study of insulin aspart (IAsp) were analyzed, and 70
   eligible clamps were grouped by CPt/CP0: group A ({[}CPt/CP0](max)( )>
   upper limit of RI), group B (1<{[}CPt/CP0](max) <= upper limit of RI),
   and group C ({[}CPt/CP0](max) <= 1). The differences in basal and
   clamped blood glucose, CPt/CP0, and the pharmacokinetics and
   pharmacodynamics of IAsp were compared, and the relationship between
   elevated CPt and the accuracy of pharmacodynamics was analyzed. The RI
   of CPt/CP0 was 22.7\%-152.1\%; 1.5 x baseline might be a ceiling for the
   increase in CPt under stable conditions. The maximum glucose infusion
   rate (GIR) in group A tended to be higher than that in group B or C
   (P-for trend = 0.033). The AUC(GIR,0-10h) in groups A, B, and C was 1983
   +/- 650,1682 +/- 454, and 1479 +/- 440 mg/kg (P = 0.047), respectively,
   under comparable IAsp exposure. No intergroup difference was detected in
   clamped glucose, IAsp dose, or body mass index. In conclusion,
   postdosing C-peptide over 1.5x baseline indicates insufficient
   inhibition of endogenous insulin secretion, which could compromise the
   pharmacodynamics of insulin preparations.}},

Abstract = {{Mining biosynthetic genes for the exploration of hybrid metabolic
   pathways is a promising approach in heterologous production of natural
   and unnatural products. Here, we developed an integrative biosynthetic
   gene duster (BGC) mining strategy to engineer the biosynthesis of
   L-homophenylalanine (L-Hph), an important intermediate for the synthesis
   of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We assembled the putative
   L-Hph BGCs and integrated phylogenetic analysis with target metabolite
   abundance mapping to prioritize candidate BGCs. To obtain an effective
   L-Hph pathway, various combinations of candidate genes from different
   species were screened in an iterative design-build-test stepwise manner.
   After the pathway was strength balanced and the metabolic flux was
   enhanced, engineered Escherichia colt produced 1.41 g/L of L-Hph from
   glucose in feeding shake-flask fermentation. Our duster mining strategy
   enabled optimization of the target metabolic pathway, and it would be
   promising for production of other valuable products in the postgenomic
   era.}},

Abstract = {{The reproduction of the shape of giant vesicles usually results in the
   increase of their ``population{''} size. This may be achieved on giant
   vesicles by appropriately supplying ``mother{''} vesicles with
   membranogenic amphiphiles. The next ``generation{''} of ``daughter{''}
   vesicles obtained from this ``feeding{''} is inherently difficult to
   distinguish from the original mothers. Here we report on a method for
   the consecutive feeding with different fatty acids that each provoke
   membrane growth and detachment of daughter vesicles from glass
   microsphere-supported phospholipidic mother vesicles. We discovered that
   a saturated fatty acid was carried over to the next generation of
   mothers better than two unsaturated congeners. This has an important
   bearing on the growth and replication of primitive compartments at the
   early stages of life. Microsphere-supported vesicles are also a precise
   analytical tool.}},

Abstract = {{In order to study the effect of stitching density, tow size of the
   suture and diameter of the stitching hole on the shear property of the
   stitched three-dimensional woven composite/titanium hybrid board
   stitching connection structure, seven groups of samples with different
   stitching densities, tow size of the suture and diameter of the
   stitching hole were tested. A reference group whose samples were
   unstitched was also tested to show the effect of stitching on the joint.
   Different failure modes of the lap zone with different stitching
   parameters were observed in in-situ mesoexperiment, and the damage
   morphologies of the characteristic points on the load-displacement curve
   were given. The result shows that increasing tow size of the suture and
   increasing stitching density can both increase the failure load of the
   hybrid joint. Increasing the stitching density is proved more effective
   in improving the failure load. Doubling the stitching density can
   increase the failure load of the stitched joint about 82. 0\%. Doubling
   the tow size of the suture can only increase the failure load of the
   joint about 24. 3\%; Whether the diameter of the stitching hole is 2 mm
   or 4 mm do not influence the bearing capacity of the structure
   obviously, and when the stitching hole diameter reaches 6 mm, the
   bearing capacity is reduced due to the low strength of the epoxy resin
   in the gap between stitching hole and suture. It is dangerous to
   increase diameter of stitching hole above 4 mm; the shear failure of the
   stitched three-dimension woven composite/titanium alloy hybrid structure
   is observed by mesoscopic mechanical test. Composite/titanium alloy
   interface failure, crack initiation and extension in composite or in lap
   zone and failure of the lap zone are the three main stages of the
   structure failure observed in the test; The suture failure in the
   connect zone includes suture pull out and suture cut off. There are
   three failure modes of the lap zone observed in test. In suture cut off
   mode, all sutures in lap zone are cut off. The position at which the
   suture is cut is related to the diameter of the stitching hole. In
   suture cut off/pull out mixed mode, some of the interface between suture
   and threedimension woven composites fail and the suture is partly or
   completely pull out. In the group with high stitching density, sutures
   near the end of the three-dimension woven composite crush the composite
   and extrude out of the composite. Stitching density is the major factor
   in the failure mode of the joint.}},

Abstract = {{Copper nanostructures are promising catalysts for the electrochemical
   reduction of CO2 because of their unique ability to produce a large
   proportion of multi-carbon products. Despite great progress, the
   selectivity and stability of such catalysts still need to be
   substantially improved. Here, we demonstrate that controlling the
   surface oxidation of Cu nanowires (CuNWs) can greatly improve their C2+
   selectivity and stability. Specifically, we achieve a faradaic
   efficiency as high as 57.7 and 52.0 \% for ethylene when the CuNWs are
   oxidized by the O-2 from air and aqueous H2O2, respectively, and both of
   them show hydrogen selectivity below 12 \%. The high yields of C2+
   products can be mainly attributed to the increase in surface roughness
   and the generation of defects and cavities during the electrochemical
   reduction of the oxide layer. Our results also indicate that the
   formation of a relatively thick, smooth oxide sheath can improve the
   catalytic stability by mitigating the fragmentation issue.}},

Abstract = {{Large volumes of produced water are generated as a byproduct in
   activities of oil and gas exploitation, which can be reused in
   agriculture after a treatment process. Activated sludge treatment has
   been successfully used to remove oil from wastewater, but systematic
   studies on the toxicity of this effluent using this treatment are scarce
   in the literature. In this study, it was investigated the performance of
   an activated sludge system in the treatment of a synthetic produced
   water under different initial conditions in terms of salinity and oil
   and grease concentration. Furthermore, it was evaluated this effluent
   phytotoxicity in the germination, and seedling and plant growths of
   sunflower and corn seeds using untreated and treated synthetic produced
   water. Results revealed the activated sludge effectiveness in oil and
   grease and salinity removal from produced water, viz. high removal
   efficiency of 99.01 +/- 0.28 and 91.07 +/- 0.39\%., respectively.
   Untreated produced water showed considerable toxic effects on the
   germination (74.67 +/- 2.31\% and 82.67 +/- 2.31 for sunflower and corn
   seeds, respectively) and growth stages of sunflower and corn seed
   plants. The germination percentage was approximately 100\% for both
   types of seed. The seedling and plant growth of the two seeds irrigated
   with treated produced water had similar performance when used tap water.
   These results highlighted the potential reuse as an unconventional water
   resource for plant irrigation of the synthetic produced water treated by
   an activated sludge process, which technology has showed high removal
   performance of salinity and oil.}},

Abstract = {{The viscoelastic surfactants (VES)-based acid diverters are frequently
   used to divert acid flow from high-permeability layers into
   low-permeability for enhanced overall productivity of the treated well.
   In general, an optimum VES-based system possesses advantages of decrease
   in absorption loss, damage of reservoir, and improved adaptability of
   active agents to high salinity. Herein, we report the synthesis of three
   new zwitterionic gemini surfactants (1-3) and previously known
   amidosulfobutaine (C(18)AMP3SB) has been accomplished for the
   investigation of diverting acid performance. The synthesis of these
   surfactants was achieved by the amidation of the acid chlorides of
   commercially available fatty acids with 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine
   followed by subsequent reactions with appropriate sultone or ethyl
   4-bromobutanoate. The synthesized surfactants were well characterized by
   spectroscopic methods including IR and NMR spectroscopy. The
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results suggested that surfactants
   (1-3) and C(18)AMP3SB possess excellent thermal stability, with no
   appreciable loss of mass up to 300 degrees C. The viscosity measurements
   of the neat surfactants (1-3) and C(18)AMP3SB were performed under
   various temperatures, in the presence of different concentration of
   calcium chloride salt with the aid shear viscosimetry. The analysis
   revealed that the viscosity of neat C(18)AMP3SB increases with increase
   in concentration of CaCl2. With 10\% CaCl2 solution, the viscosity was
   increased from 7.5 to 33.55 cPs, whereas in 20\% CaCl2 the viscosity
   reached to 102 cPs with rise in temperature from ambient to 90 degrees
   C. Moreover, the viscosity of neat surfactants (1-3) did not exhibit any
   appreciable viscosity change under the experimental conditions. However,
   the mixture of surfactants (1-3) each in combination with C(18)AMP3SB
   (1:1) displayed significant upsurge in the viscosity, up to more than 10
   folds.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose We aimed at verifying whether resveratrol can decrease cell
   proliferation and change osteogenic differentiation of cells obtained
   from patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1). Methods Deciduous
   dental pulp derived stem cells were isolated from NF1 patient and
   healthy volunteer. These cells were subjected to increasing
   concentrations of resveratrol and evaluated for proliferation and
   mineralization of osteogenic differentiation. Results The results showed
   that resveratrol reduced the difference in proliferation between CNT and
   NF1 cells in a dose-dependent manner and this property was more
   prominent in affected cells than in healthy cells. Resveratrol showed no
   statistically significant changes in mineralization in osteogenic
   differentiation of NF1 cells, at low doses tested. Conclusions In
   conclusion, in a dose-dependent manner, resveratrol displays interesting
   properties that could be applied in a possible treatment aimed at
   decreasing cellular proliferation in neurofibromatosis. Furthermore, it
   is selective concerning healthy cells and not affecting cell
   differentiation. Further research to cell selectivity, differentiation

Abstract = {{International and national studies have revealed a sharp decline in
   student science engagement during the middle years of schooling. In
   Aotearoa New Zealand, over 20 years of cross-sectional evidence has
   repeatedly shown high levels of student engagement with science in
   primary school and lower levels in high school, but very little evidence
   in-between. In this study, we conducted an engagement survey (n = 429)
   across Years 7-10 (11-15 yo) to better understand this gap. We found
   that decreasing engagement with science was only apparent when
   considering school science, but not in other contexts like choosing
   science careers or science outside of school. Contrary to common
   rhetoric of a `decline' in student engagement with science, we suggest
   that the middle years are marked with uncertainty about the role of
   science in students' lives, which would benefit from a shift toward
   contextualised curricula.}},

Abstract = {{Lianas rely on trees for support and access to high-light positions in
   the forest canopy, but the implications for how lianas explore the
   canopy compared to trees remain understudied. We present an in situ
   forest canopy study to test the hypotheses that: (1) lianas favour leaf
   display over stem investment compared to trees and (2) lianas have
   greater potential to colonize non-shaded, high-light areas effectively
   than trees.
   We compared branches of 16 liana species with those of 16 sympatric tree
   species in the canopy of two lowland tropical forests with contrasting
   rainfall regimes in Panama using 40-50 m tall canopy cranes. One forest
   was relatively dry and seasonal in rainfall and associated solar
   radiation. The other forest was relatively wet and had a weaker
   seasonality.
   We observed that lianas were more efficient in leaf display over stem
   investment than trees, particularly in the forest with lower
   precipitation and stronger seasonality. Specifically, lianas had a lower
   LMA (leaf mass per unit leaf area), stronger apical dominance, higher
   stem slenderness and fewer leaf layers than trees. In the forest with
   higher precipitation and weaker seasonality, lianas also had stronger
   apical control and fewer leaf layers than trees, but both lianas and
   trees were relatively similar in LMA and stem slenderness.
   Our study shows that lianas more effectively explore the canopy than
   trees under drier conditions, but much less so under wetter conditions.
   We argue that lianas display a functional strategy that allows them to
   better intercept light than the tree species in forests with low
   precipitation and strong seasonality, while they are constrained to
   display such strategy at high precipitation - light-limited - sites.

Abstract = {{In India, the deceased kidney transplant program is still in its
   preliminary stage, and accepting deceased donors with snakebite is just
   a forward step to expand the donor pool. We report here the outcome of 8
   successful renal transplantations from brain-dead donors who died from a
   neurotoxic snakebite. We accepted them as donors as they had no evidence
   of hemotoxic snakebite. 7 recipients did well. 1 died due to sepsis with
   a functioning graft. 1 required renal biopsy that showed acute tubular
   necrosis. 1 required re-exploration due to graft collection due to a
   surgical issue. Patient and graft survival in follow-up were similar to
   other matched deceased donors in our center. According to our
   experience, utilizing brain-dead donors who died from a neurotoxic
   snakebite is safe and may dramatically expand the donor pool especially
   in countries where death due to snakebite is high in numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Should workers be provided with insurance against search-induced wage
   fluctuations? To answer this question, I rely on the numerical
   simulations of a model of on-the-job search and precautionary savings.
   The model is calibrated to low-skilled workers in the United States. The
   extent of insurance is determined by the degree of progressivity of a
   non-linear transfer schedule. The fundamental trade-off is that a more
   generous provision of insurance reduces incentives to search for
   better-paying jobs, which increases the cost of providing insurance. I
   show that progressivity raises the search intensity of unemployed
   workers, which reduces the equilibrium rate of unemployment, but it
   lowers the search intensity of employed job seekers, which reduces the
   output level. I also solve numerically for the optimal non-linear
   transfer schedule. The optimal policy is to provide little insurance up
   to a monthly income level of \$1350, so as to preserve incentives to
   move up the wage ladder, and nearly full insurance above \$1450. This
   policy reduces the standard deviation of labor income net of transfers
   by 34 percent and generates a consumption-equivalent welfare gain of 0.7
   percent. The absence of private savings does not fundamentally change
   the shape of the optimal transfer function, but tilts the optimal policy
   towards more insurance, at the expense of a less efficient allocation of
   workers across jobs.}},

Journal = {{HERNIA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The concept of mesh use during open ventral hernia repair with a
   concomitant intestinal procedure remains controversial and it remains
   unclear whether the SSI profile of contaminated fields in this setting
   more closely resembles clean-contaminated or dirty wounds. Methods
   Patients who underwent an open ventral hernia repair and intestinal
   procedures were extracted from the ACS-NSQIP database. Data analysis was
   performed for mesh versus no mesh groups in aggregate and matched
   cohorts. The 30-day outcomes including mortality, morbidity, surgical
   site infections (SSI), readmission, reoperation, and length of stay were
   compared between the groups. Results Of 5104 patients in the mesh group,
   3297 patients were matched 1:1 with patients without mesh. Mesh
   placement was associated with higher overall morbidity (35.1\% vs.
   29.8\%; p < 0.001), overall SSI (27.1\% vs. 18\%; p < 0.001), deep SSI
   (5.9\% vs. 4.3\%; p = 0.003), organ-space SSI (6.8\% vs. 5.5\%; p =
   0.027), reoperation (9.9\% vs. 8.2\%; p = 0.016), readmission (16.7\%
   vs. 12.7\%; p < 0.001), and longer hospital stays (10.9 +/- 15.2 vs. 9.7
   +/- 10.7; p < 0.001). When mesh was used, the SSI profile of
   contaminated fields was similar to dirty wounds (26.4\% vs. 27.5\%; p =
   0.702), rather than clean-contaminated fields (26.4\% vs. 19.2\%; p <
   0.001). Conclusion Concomitant bowel procedure and mesh placement at the
   time of open ventral hernia repair was associated with worse outcomes.
   The SSI profile of the contaminated fields was more similar to dirty
   wounds. When deciding whether to place mesh during ventral hernia
   repairs with concomitant bowel procedures, strong consideration should
   be given to the increased risk of short-term complications versus the
   potential long-term benefits.}},

Abstract = {{The first autochthonous case of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection in
   Brazil was in September 2014 in the State of Amapa, and from there it
   rapidly spread across the country. The present study was conducted in
   2016 in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, and the aims were to describe
   the epidemiological and the clinical aspects of the CHIKV outbreak.
   Biological samples from 284 chikungunya suspected cases were screened
   for CHIKV and Flavivirus (FV) RNA using qRT-PCR. Negative PCR samples
   were also screened for anti-CHIKV and anti-FVIgM by ELISA. CHIKV RNA
   were detected in 125 samples mostly occurring from January through March
   (46\%), mainly affecting adults and older adults. We found a gradual
   decrease in viral RNA over the disease time. Anti-CHIKV IgM was found in
   47.5\% after negative CHIKV qRT-PCR. Interestingly, 45.0\%
   simultaneously had positive results for CHIKV and FV IgM, suggesting the
   occurrence of virus co-circulation. The most frequent symptom was fever
   (91\%). Women presented more chance to develop nausea and abdominal pain
   compared to men. Our data described and allows us to better understand
   the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the 2016 chikungunya
   outbreak in Rio Grande do Norte and can help in the early clinical
   diagnosis of the virus.}},

Title = {{Light Limitation and Depth-Variable Sedimentation Drives Vertical Reef
   Compression on Turbid Coral Reefs}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Turbid coral reefs experience high suspended sediment loads and
   low-light conditions that vertically compress the maximum depth of reef
   growth. Although vertical reef compression is hypothesized to further
   decrease available coral habitat as environmental conditions on reefs
   change, its causative processes have not been fully quantified. Here, we
   present a high-resolution time series of environmental parameters known
   to influence coral depth distribution (light, turbidity, sedimentation,
   currents) within reef crest (2-3 m) and reef slope (7 m) habitats on two
   turbid reefs in Singapore. Light levels on reef crests were low {[}mean
   daily light integral (DLI): 13.9 +/- 5.6 and 6.4 +/- 3.0 mol photons
   m(-2) day(-1) at Kusu and Hantu, respectively], and light differences
   between reefs were driven by a 2-fold increase in turbidity at Hantu
   (typically 10-50 mg l(-1)), despite its similar distance offshore. Light
   attenuation was rapid (KdPAR: 0.49-0.57 m(-1)) resulting in a shallow
   euphotic depth of <11 m, and daily fluctuations of up to 8 m. Remote
   sensing indicates a regional west-to-east gradient in light availability
   and turbidity across southern Singapore attributed to spatial
   variability in suspended sediment, chlorophyll-a and colored dissolved
   organic matter. Net sediment accumulation rates were similar to 5\% of
   gross rates on reefs (9.8-22.9 mg cm(-2) day(-1)) due to the
   resuspension of sediment by tidal currents, which contribute to the
   ecological stability of reef crest coral communities. Lower current
   velocities on the reef slope deposit similar to 4 kg m(2) more silt
   annually, and result in high soft-sediment benthic cover. Our findings
   confirm that vertical reef compression is driven from the bottom-up, as
   the photic zone contracts and fine silt accumulates at depth, reducing
   available habitat for coral growth. Assuming no further declines in
   water quality, future sea level rise could decrease the depth
   distribution of these turbid reefs by a further 8-12\%. This highlights
   the vulnerability of deeper coral communities on turbid reefs to the
   combined effects of both local anthropogenic inputs and climate-related
   impacts.}},

Abstract = {{Aims/Introduction The present study aimed to clarify the prevalence and
   clinical characteristics of sarcopenia and dynapenia, which are muscle
   weakness with and without low muscle mass, respectively, in Japanese
   patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
   Materials and Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 1,328
   participants with type 1 diabetes (n = 177), type 2 diabetes (n = 645)
   and without diabetes (n = 506). Sarcopenia was defined as a low grip
   strength and slow gait speed with low skeletal muscle mass index,
   whereas dynapenia was defined as low strengths of grip and knee
   extension with a normal skeletal muscle mass index. Participants without
   sarcopenia and dynapenia were defined as robust.
   Results Among participants aged >= 65 years, sarcopenia and dynapenia
   were observed in 12.2\% and 0.5\% of individuals without diabetes,
   42.9\% and 11.4\% of type 1 diabetes patients, and 20.9\% and 13.9\% of
   type 2 diabetes patients. In both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes
   patients, sarcopenic patients were significantly older and thinner, and
   showed a significantly higher rate of diabetic neuropathy than robust
   patients. In patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes,
   dynapenic patients were older, and showed a higher rate of diabetic
   neuropathy and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate than robust
   patients. Patients complicated with sarcopenia and dynapenia showed a
   significantly lower physical quality of life and higher rate of
   incidental falls than robust patients.
   Conclusions Sarcopenia and dynapenia were more frequent in patients with
   type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes than in individuals without
   diabetes, which might contribute to their impaired quality of life and
   incidental falls.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aim Although colonic diverticular bleeding (CDB) is
   considered to have good prognosis with conservative therapy, some cases
   are severe. The efficacy of urgent colonoscopy for CDB and clinical
   factors affecting CDB prognosis are unclear. This study aimed to
   evaluate the efficacy of urgent colonoscopy for CDB and identify risk
   factors for unfavorable events, including in-hospital death during
   admission, owing to CDB.
   Methods We collected CDB patients' data using the Diagnosis Procedure
   Combination database system. We divided eligible patients into urgent
   and elective colonoscopy groups using propensity score matching and
   compared endoscopic hemostasis and in-hospital death rates and length of
   hospital stay. We also conducted logistic regression analysis to
   identify clinical factors affecting CBD clinical events, including
   in-hospital death, a relatively rare CDB complication.
   Results Urgent colonoscopy reduced the in-hospital death rate (0.35\% vs
   0.58\%, P = 0.033) and increased the endoscopic hemostasis rate (3.0\%
   vs 1.7\%, P < 0.0001) compared with elective colonoscopy. Length of
   hospitalization was shorter in the urgent than in the elective
   colonoscopy group (8 vs 9 days, P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis also
   revealed that urgent colonoscopy reduced in-hospital death (odds ratio =
   0.67, 95\% confidence interval: 0.46-0.97, P = 0.036) and increased
   endoscopic hemostasis (odds ratio = 1.84, 95\% confidence interval:
   1.53-2.22, P < 0.0001).
   Conclusion Urgent colonoscopy for CDB may facilitate identification of
   the bleeding site and reduce in-hospital death. The necessity and
   appropriate timing of urgent colonoscopy should be considered based on
   patients' condition.}},

Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Mast cells (MCs) are central effector cells in allergic reactions that
   are often mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE). Allergies commonly start
   at an early age, and both MCs and IgE are detectable in fetuses.
   However, the origin of fetal IgE and whether fetal MCs can degranulate
   in response to IgE-dependent activation are presently unknown. Here, we
   show that human and mouse fetal MCs phenotypically mature through
   pregnancy and can be sensitized by maternal IgE. IgE crossed the
   placenta, dependent on the fetal neonatal Fc receptor (FcRN), and
   sensitized fetal MCs for allergenspecific degranulation. Both passive
   and active prenatal sensitization conferred allergen sensitivity,
   resulting in postnatal skin and airway inflammation after the first
   allergen encounter. We report a role for MCs within the developing fetus
   and demonstrate that fetal MCs may contribute to antigen-specific
   vertical transmission of allergic disease.}},

Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF VISUAL IMPAIRMENT}},
Abstract = {{Individuals with ocular and oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) have
   significantly reduced visual acuity (VA) resulting in visual impairment
   (VI). The aim is to report on the visual function of adolescents with
   OCA and their quality of life (QoL) in terms of their visual ability. A
   total of 28 adolescents with OCA participated in this study. Tests of
   visual function included distance VA, refractive error, contrast
   sensitivity (CS), and colour vision. The Cardiff Visual Ability
   Questionnaire for Children (CVAQC) was used to assess visual ability.
   All participants presented with cutaneous hypopigmentation and
   nystagmus, while only two had strabismus. A mean myopic refractive error
   was found, and with-the-rule (WTR) astigmatism was most common. The mean
   best-corrected VA was 0.81 +/- 0.17 logMAR and 0.81 +/- 0.18 logMAR in
   the right and left eyes, respectively. The mean CS with the best
   refractive correction was 1.23 +/- 0.33 log CS in the right eye and 1.29
   +/- 0.33 log CS in the left eye. The mean Cardiff visual ability score
   was -0.37 +/- 0.79 log units. The variation of refractive errors and the
   magnitude thereof underscores the need for regular eye examinations in
   individuals with OCA. The majority of participants had moderate VI, and
   these participants had a better mean Cardiff visual ability score than
   those with severe VI. Similarly, participants with normal binocular CS
   had a better Cardiff visual ability score than those with a loss of CS.}},

   decomposition of data matrices using the popular multivariate curve
   resolution-alternating least-squares model. It is based on a nonlinear
   maximization and minimization of a component-wise signal contribution
   function (SCF), with a single-objective function and a separate module
   for applying a variety of constraints. The algorithm can be applied to
   multicomponent systems and efficiently estimates the extreme component
   profiles corresponding to maximum and minimum SCF in the presence of
   varying amounts of instrumental noise. Simulated systems mimicking
   multicomponent and multisample analytical calibration protocols have
   been studied, having uncalibrated interferents in the test samples.
   Different noise structures (independent and identically distributed,
   proportional and correlated) were added to the data matrices, with
   results that indicate an increase in the extension of feasible bands as
   the noise level increases.}},

Title = {{Perceptions of keepers of stingless bees (Tetragonula, Austroplebeia)
   regarding Aboriginal beliefs and practices in Australia}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Unlike the situation in other countries such as Brazil or Mexico,
   beekeeping with stingless bees has only recently become a prominent
   practice in Australia. The first divisible brood-chamber hive designed
   for native bees was developed in the late 1980s, which stimulated the
   social interest and popularity for keeping stingless bees on the east
   coast of Australia. The cultural significance and history of stingless
   bees date back to the oldest known evidence of human settlement as far
   back as 65,000 years ago. Insects and especially stingless bees have
   often held significant traditional values, beliefs and practices among
   Aboriginal people. The situation in Australia is unique because there is
   a mismatch between cultural constructs and spatial-temporal scales; with
   a new practice, stingless beekeeping, which is mainly present in urban
   areas, and a (intangible) cultural heritage based on traditional hunting
   and honey-gathering practices. This study sought to better understand
   the diversity of keepers of stingless bees and indigenous social
   representations based in Brisbane and the adjoining regions, the center
   of stingless beekeeping in Australia; and to analyze the database in
   relation to highlighted cultural and spatial-temporal considerations.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Asian-born gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM) who
   are newly arrived in Australia are at a higher risk of acquiring HIV
   than Australian-born gbMSM. We used a social constructionist framework
   to explore HIV knowledge and prevention strategies used by newly-arrived
   Asian-born gbMSM. Twenty four Asian-born gbMSM, aged 20-34 years,
   attending Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, who arrived in Australia in
   the preceding five years, participated in semi-structured, face-to-face
   interviews. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed
   thematically. Participants described hiding their sexual identities in
   their country of origin, particularly from family members, due to fear
   of judgement and discrimination resulting from exposure to sexual
   identity and HIV related stigma in their countries of origin, although
   some were open to friends. Despite feeling more sexual freedom and
   acceptance in Australia, many were still not forthcoming with their
   sexual identity due to internalised feelings of stigma and shame.
   Exposure to stigma in their country of origin led many to report anxiety
   around HIV testing in Australia due to a fear of testing positive. Some
   described experiencing racism and lack of acceptance in the gay
   community in Australia, particularly on dating apps. Fear of
   discrimination and judgement about their sexual identity can have a
   significant impact on Asian-born gbMSM living in Australia, particularly
   in terms of social connectedness. Additionally, HIV-related stigma can
   contribute to anxieties around HIV testing. Our data highlights the
   potential discrimination Asian-born gbMSM face in Australia, which has
   implications for social connectedness, particularly with regard to
   LGBTQI communities and HIV testing practices. Future studies should
   determine effective strategies to reduce sexual identity and HIV-related
   stigma in newly-arrived Asian-born gbMSM.}},

Title = {{Corrosion of pipelines under dynamic direct current interference}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{261}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{While pipeline corrosion under direct current (DC) interference has been
   investigated, there is few work conducted under dynamic DC existing in
   reality. This work studied corrosion of an X52 pipeline steel under
   dynamic DC interference in a diluted sodium bicarbonate solution, which
   simulated the soil electrolyte. Electrochemical measurements,
   weight-loss testing and surface characterization were used to determine
   the effects of DC current density, pulse frequency and wave form of the
   DC interference on the corrosion. It is found that the dynamic DC can
   accelerate the steel corrosion at a rate more rapidly than that under
   the static DC at specific current densities. However, the corrosion
   enhancement is not significant, especially at low DC current densities.
   The role of the AC component in the pulse DC in corrosion becomes more
   apparent as the DC current density increases. When the pulse frequency
   of the DC increases, the corrosion rate decreases. The wave form of the
   dynamic DC does not obviously affect the steel corrosion. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) have cognitive impairments across
   several domains. Cognition decline is related to the complex
   interrelationship between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and
   redox system imbalance. However, the effect of sex on cognitive
   impairment and biomarkers has not been fully studied in patients with
   drug-naive first episode (DNFE) SCZ. 327 DNFE SCZ patients and 391
   healthy controls were recruited, and the levels of BDNF and
   malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activities of total SOD, Mn-SOD, CuZn-SOD
   enzymes were measured. Cognitive function was measured by using the
   Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological status
   (RBANS) and clinical symptoms by the Positive and Negative Syndrome
   Scale (PANSS). Patients performed worse on most cognitive tasks than
   controls, but there was no significant sex difference in cognitive
   function between patients and controls. Further analysis showed that a
   sex difference in MDA was found in controls rather than patients,
   indicating that MDA levels in men were higher than those in women in
   controls. Moreover, the Mn-SOD was significantly correlated with
   attention, language and RBANS total scores only in male patients.
   Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the interaction between
   BDNF and Mn-SOD or SOD was associated with RBANS language index score in
   male patients. Our results suggest that the interrelationship of BDNF
   with antioxidant mechanisms may contribute to the pathological
   mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits only in male DNFE patients with
   SCZ, but not in female patients.}},

Title = {{Efficient fault-tolerant logical Hadamard gates implementation in
   Reed-Muller quantum codes}},
Journal = {{CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE \& EXPERIENCE}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the implementation of fault-tolerant logical Hadamard
   gates in Reed-Muller quantum codes (RMQCs). During the realization, we
   consider the influences of random single-qubit errors and some
   error-detecting stabilizers are simplified by the existing syndromes. We
   first identify the errors and modify the gauge-fixing syndromes, then
   refer to the modified syndromes to select the fix operations, and
   finally perform the error-correcting and fix operations together.
   Furthermore, we establish a graph model for the RMQCs and exhibit a
   progress of finding the fix operations for the unsatisfied stabilizers.
   For the circuit design, we optimize the choice of gauge operators, the
   positions of the ancillary qubits and design a parallel circuit for
   implementing a fault-tolerant logical Hadamard gate in 15-qubit RMQC. We
   simulate the progress of finding corresponding fix operations for
   31-qubit and 63-qubit RMQCs and the whole process of realizing logical
   Hadamard gate with random single-qubit errors for 15-qubit and 31-qubit
   RMQCs. Results show that correct fix operations can be obtained and
   fault-tolerant logical Hadamard gates can be realized as expected. The
   performance comparisons are also given and the results show that our
   method can achieve a higher success rate with a reasonable higher cost.
   With the implementation of the logical Hadamard gate, a universal
   fault-tolerant gate set is achieved in single RMQC.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the synthetic relevance of heteroarenes in various areas
   ranging from organic synthesis to medicinal chemistry, developing
   practically simple methodologies to access functionalized heteroarenes
   is of a significant value. Described herein is an efficient approach for
   C-H silylation and hydroxymethylation of pyridines and related
   heterocycles by the combination of silanes or methanol with readily
   available N-methoxypyridinium ions with a low catalyst loading (2 mol
   \%) under blue light irradiation. The synthetic importance of the
   developed reactions is demonstrated by the synthesis of biologically
   relevant compounds. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy,
   quantum yield measurements, and density-functional theory calculations
   allowed us to understand reaction mechanisms of both photocatalytic
   reactions.}},

Abstract = {{The recent trend towards tile-based manycore architectures has helped to
   tackle the memory wall by physically distributing memories and
   processing nodes. However, this introduced a data-to-task locality
   challenge and inter-tile communication thus often imposes significant
   software overhead. Thus, we proposed software-defined hardware-managed
   SHARQ queues that enable efficient inter-tile communication by
   leveraging user-defined queues with arbitrarily sized elements. To
   ensure (remote) processing of queued elements, SHARQ introduces an
   optional handler task, which is scheduled by hardware on demand. Queue
   management, intra- and inter-tile data transfer, and handler task
   invocation are entirely handled by hardware. Only rare tasks, like the
   dynamic queue creation at run-time, are performed in software. DySHARQ,
   an extension of SHARQ, enables dynamic and concurrent queue memory
   management and queue length adjustments to be able to adapt to
   application and resource requirement changes. The DySHARQ hardware is
   able to monitor the queue memory requirements at run-time and
   conditionally schedules a software-defined memory management task. It
   further optimizes the hardware-software interaction for local queue
   operations. We integrated DySHARQ into the MPI library used by the NAS
   benchmarks. The evaluation shows a reduction in execution time by up to
   43\% (compared to software) for the communication intense IS kernel in a
   4 x 4 tile design on an FPGA platform with a total of 80 LEON3 cores.
   The dynamic memory management reduces the memory footprint by 3.75x in a
   2 x 2 design.}},

Title = {{Environmental assessment of complex wastewater valorisation by
   polyhydroxyalkanoates production}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{744}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are biodegradable polymers with renewable
   origin that are expected to substitute conventional petrochemical
   plastics. However, before they are commercialized, life-cycle
   environmental validation is needed, to prove that there is an actual
   benefit with the replacement of non-renewable plastics with PHA.
   Nowadays, environmental evaluations assessing bioplastics production at
   full-scale are scarce due to the lack of data, so experimental results
   were used to evaluate the feasibility of PHA production employing high
   load wastewater. A three-stage PHA production system utilising a mixed
   microbial culture (MMC) was successfully operated for two years
   employing complex wastewater from a fish-canning industry. The results
   obtained were scaled-up to define and compare a circular economy
   scenario performance, with PHA production, with the current linear
   approach (i.e. effluent generation, treatment and discharge). To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the environmental
   performance of a MMC-based full-scale PHA production system using saline
   wastewater is evaluated. Results show an average improvement of ca. 25\%
   for nine out of ten studied categories if the circular economy approach
   is implemented. The sludge management strategy was a key factor for the
   environmental validation of the process, and if composting is applied
   instead of anaerobic digestion, the improvement is reported in eight
   categories. When a more conservative replacement yield of fossil-based
   plastic was tested, the circular economy approach was the preferable
   option in 8 out of 10 categories. The significance of the downstream
   process was also confirmed by this study, although it was not a barrier
   to show the feasibility of producing added-value bioproducts under a
   circular economy approach. Finally, this work proposes new process
   integration strategies to reduce the environmental burdens of PHA
   production and increase the body of knowledge on MMC-based processes, an
   area where LCA case studies are still scarce. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) are generalist obligate brood
   parasites, laying in the nest of nearly 300 avian species, and
   successfully parasitizing well over 100 host species. Cowbird eggs are
   generally considered non-mimetic, although some have suggested that
   cowbird eggs resemble several of their host species' eggs. To date, no
   investigation has examined the level of avian-perceived similarity
   between cowbird and diverse host eggs in the contexts of light
   characteristics at the nest and the visual system of the relevant
   viewer. Because the cowbird exploits a wide range of species that lay in
   a variety of nest types, hosts view these eggs under an array of light
   conditions which could facilitate or hinder egg discrimination. When
   considering the visual system of the relevant viewers and the light
   conditions at their nest, we found that the coloration of cowbird eggs
   was more similar to host than non-host species' eggs. Host responses
   (whether they accept or reject cowbird eggs) were not statistically
   different when hosts perceived a large chromatic difference between
   their own eggs and the cowbird's eggs. Instead, we found that host
   responses were predicted by the degree to which nesting light conditions
   facilitated color similarity between host and cowbird eggs, such that
   hosts typically nesting under light conditions where this color
   discrimination task was more challenging were more likely to reject
   cowbird eggs. This suggests that the nesting light environment may have
   selected for increased coevolved egg recognition abilities in a suite of
   cowbird host species, even in the absence of parasitic egg color
   mimicry.}},

Abstract = {{The present study explores the influence of challenge stressors on
   identity orientation directly and via thriving at work and employee
   investment. Drawing on the broaden-and-build theory of positive
   emotions, this study proposes challenge stressors as a critical
   predictor of identity orientation. The purpose of this article is to
   explore if a particular identity is salient in different contextual
   factors, and this study suggests that challenge stressors stimulate
   personal, relational, and collective identities to respond to a
   situation. The relationships hypothesized in this study were tested
   using a sample of 225 employees from the banking sector of Pakistan. A
   time-lagged research design consisting of two waves of data collection
   was employed. A structural equation modeling technique was used to test
   the hypotheses regarding the relationship between challenge stressors
   and identity orientation, including the role of thriving at work and
   employee investment as intervening mechanisms of this relationship.
   Results showed that challenge stressors had a significant positive
   relationship with identity orientation. The results also confirmed the
   sequential mediation of thriving at work and employee investment in the
   relationship between challenge stressors and identity orientation. The
   findings suggest that the positive side of stress as a strength
   motivates employees for continued self-development. Importantly,
   challenge stressors enhance employees' ability to thrive at work and, in
   turn, they invest in the work more and identify themselves strongly with
   their organization and work.}},

Abstract = {{The rational design of catalysts remains a challenging endeavor within
   the broader chemical community owing to the myriad variables that can
   affect key bond-forming events. Designing selective catalysts for any
   reaction requires an efficient strategy for discovering predictive
   structure-activity relationships. Herein, we describe the use of
   iterative supervised principal component analysis (ISPCA) in de novo
   catalyst design. The regioselective synthesis of
   2,5-dimethyl-1,3,4-triphenyl-1H-pyrrole (C) via a Ti-catalyzed formal
   {[}2 + 2 + 1] cycloaddition of phenylpropyne and azobenzene was targeted
   as a proof of principle. The initial reaction conditions led to an
   unselective mixture of all possible pyrrole regioisomers. ISPCA was
   conducted on a training set of catalysts, and their performance was
   regressed against the scores from the top three principal components.
   Component loadings from this PCA space and k-means clustering were used
   to inform the design of new test catalysts. The selectivity of a
   prospective test set was predicted in silico using the ISPCA model, and
   optimal candidates were synthesized and tested experimentally. This
   data-driven predictive-modeling workflow was iterated, and after only
   three generations the catalytic selectivity was improved from 0.5
   (statistical mixture of products) to over 11 (>90\% C) by incorporating
   2,6-dimethyl-4-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pyridine as a ligand. The origin of
   catalyst selectivity was probed by examining ISPCA variable loadings in
   combination with DFT modeling, revealing that ligand lability plays an
   important role in selectivity. A parallel catalyst search using
   multivariate linear regression (MLR), a popular approach in catalysis
   informatics, was also conducted in order to compare these strategies in
   a hypothetical catalyst scouting campaign. ISPCA appears to be more
   robust and predictive than MLR when sparse training sets are used that
   are representative of the data available during the early search for an
   optimal catalyst. The successful development of a highly selective
   catalyst without resorting to long, stochastic screening processes
   demonstrates the inherent power of ISPCA in de novo catalyst design and
   should motivate the general use of ISPCA in reaction development.}},

Abstract = {{The article aims to analyse gender segregation in the labour market
   while comparing two national contexts in Europe and Latin America.
   Specifically, it will consider the growth trends of female employment in
   the last 25 years (1992-2017), its distribution between activity sectors
   and occupations, and the gender pay gap. Feminization models and gender
   inequalities are framed within labour market segmentation theories,
   which are in partial contrast to human capital theories and neoclassical
   economics. The initial hypothesis is that the gender distribution of
   occupations measured by a segregation index is similar in Italy and
   Chile, despite significant differences in the socio-economic and
   institutional contexts. Through this intercontinental comparison, the
   article intends to shed light on women's labour market conditions and
   segregation patterns, which are multidimensional and generalizable
   (transcontinental) phenomena, connected to the unequal division of
   labour in the new post-industrial order.}},

Abstract = {{Selecting appropriate cell lines to represent a disease is crucial for
   the success of biomedical research, because the usage of less relevant
   cell lines could deliver misleading results. However, systematic
   guidance on cell line selection is unavailable. Here we developed a
   clinical Genomics-guided Prioritizing Strategy for Cancer Cell Lines
   (CCL-cGPS) and help to guide this process. Statistical analyses revealed
   CCL-cGPS selected cell lines were among the most appropriate models.
   Moreover, we observed a linear correlation between the drug response and
   CCL-cGPS score of cell lines for breast and thyroid cancers. Using RT4
   cells selected by CCL-GPS, we identified mebendazole and digitoxin as
   candidate drugs against bladder cancer and validate their promising
   anticancer effect through in vitro and in vivo experiments.
   Additionally, a web tool was developed. In conclusion, CCL-cGPS bridges
   the gap between tumors and cell lines, presenting a helpful guide to
   select the most suitable cell line models.}},

Abstract = {{Sea turtles are exposed to trace elements through water, sediment, and
   food. Exposure to these elements has been shown to decrease immune
   function, impair growth, and decrease reproductive output in wildlife.
   The present study compares trace element concentrations in green turtles
   in captivity at Sea Life Park Hawaii (n = 6) to wild green turtles in
   Kapoho Bay, Hawaii, USA (n = 5-7). Blood and scute samples were
   collected and analyzed for 11 elements via inductively coupled
   plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Selenium was significantly greater (p
   < 0.05) in the blood of captive turtles compared with wild turtles,
   whereas V, Ni, and Pb were significantly greater in the blood of wild
   turtles. In scute, V, Cu, Se, and Cr were significantly greater in
   captive turtles, whereas As was significantly greater in wild turtles.
   Pelleted food fed to the captive turtles and representative samples of
   the wild turtle diet were analyzed via ICP-MS to calculate trophic
   transfer factors and daily intake values. Wild turtles had greater
   estimated daily intake than captive turtles for all elements except Cu
   and Se. Because captive turtles are fed a diet very different from that
   of their wild counterparts, captive turtles do not represent control or
   reference samples for chemical exposure studies in wild turtles. No
   toxic thresholds are known for sea turtles, but rehabilitation and
   managed care facilities should monitor sea turtle elemental
   concentrations to ensure the animals' health. Environ Toxicol Chem

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of color image contents and imaging devices

   the chromatic similarity map. The structure information is characterized
   by gradient similarity map. Vividness map plays two roles in the
   proposed model. One is utilized as feature extractor to compute the
   local quality of distorted image, and the other is as a weight part to
   reflect the importance of local domain. To quantify the specific
   parameters of CAGS, Taguchi method is used and four main parameters,
   i.e., K-V, K-D, K-G and alpha, of this model are determined based on the
   statistical correlation indices. The optimal parameters of CAGS are K-V
   = K-D = 0.02, K-G = 50, and alpha = 0.1. Furthermore, the CAGS is tested
   by utilizing 94 reference images and 4830 distorted images from the four
   open image databases (LIVE, CSIQ, TID2013 and IVC). Additionally, the
   influences of the 35 distortion types on IQA are analyzed. Massive
   experiments are performed on four publicly available benchmark databases
   between CAGS and other 10 state-of-the-art and recently published IQA
   models, for the accuracy, complexity and generalization performance of
   IQA. The experimental results show that the accuracy PLCC of the CAGS
   model can achieve 0.8455 at lowest and 0.9640 at most in the four
   databases, and the results about commonly evaluation criteria prove that
   the CAGS performs higher consistency with the subjective evaluations.
   Among the 35 distortion types, the two distortion types, namely contrast
   change and change of color saturation, CAGS and mostly IQA models have
   the worst influence on IQA, and the CAGS yields the highest top three
   rank number. Moreover, the SROCC values of CAGS for other distortion
   types are all larger than 0.6 and the number of SROCC value larger than
   0.95 is 14 times. Besides, the CAGS maintains a moderate computational
   complexity. These results of test and comparison above show that the
   CAGS model is effective and feasible, and the corresponding model has an
   excellent performance.}},

Title = {{Influence of skin melanisation and ultraviolet radiation on biomarkers

Journal = {{FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{40-46}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Skin melanisation ranges widely across human populations. Melanin has
   antioxidant properties and also acts as a filter to solar ultraviolet
   radiation (UVR) incident upon the skin. In this study we firstly
   examined whether melanin level might influence baseline levels of
   systemic oxidative stress, in 65 humans in vivo from the same
   geographical area ranging from the lightest to darkest skin type
   (phototype I-VI). This was examined in wintertime (latitude 53.5 degrees
   N). Remarkably, we found that urinary biomarkers of
   oxidatively-generated DNA damage (8-oxodG) and RNA damage (8-oxoGuo)
   were significantly correlated with skin lightness (L{*}), such that
   14-15\% of the variation in their baseline levels could be explained by
   skin colour. Next we exposed 15 humans at the extremes of skin
   melanisation to a simulated summer-time exposure of solar UVR (95\% UVA,
   5\% UVB; dose standardised to sunburn threshold), following which they
   provided a sample of every urine void over the next five days. We found
   that UVR induced a small but significant increase in urinary 8-oxodG and
   8-oxoGuo, with differing kinetics between skin types. Thus greater
   melanisation is associated with protection against systemic oxidative
   stress, which may reflect melanin's antioxidant properties, and solar
   UVR exposure also influences systemic oxidative stress levels in humans.
   These novel findings may have profound implications for human physiology
   and health.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we suggest a numerical approach based on q-homotopy

   multidimensional diffusion equations which represents density dynamics

   the Caputo-Fabrizio kind. The proposed method, q-HAETM is an advanced
   adaptation in q-HAM and Elzaki transform method which makes mathematical
   calculation very effective additionally more accurate. Since, in
   classical perturbation scheme, the scheme restricted to the small
   parameter whereas the q-HAETM is not restricted to the small parameter.
   By theoretical and numerical evaluation it is observed that q-HAETM
   yields an analytical solution in the form of a convergent series. By
   taking three examples and applying q-HAETM, the numerical results reveal
   that the suggested method is straightforward to apply and

   degrees C is conducted with scanning speed of 1600 mm/s, laser power of
   370 W. The optimum aging time is 12 h at 300 degrees C, the yield
   strength of studied alloy can reach 479. 0 MPa through peak aging
   treatment. Under rapid cooling rate of SLM process, supersaturated solid
   solution is formed in Al-Mg-Sc alloy, and a large number of nanometer
   Al-3 (Sc, Zr) particles are precipitated during the fabrication and heat
   treatment process, which makes the Al-Mg-Sc alloy present excellent

Title = {{Hospital admissions during Covid-19 lock-down in Germany: Differences in
   discretionary and unavoidable cardiovascular events}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Background
   A decline in hospitalization for cardiovascular events and catheter
   laboratory activation was reported for the United States and Italy
   during the initial stage of the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020. We report on
   the deployment of emergency services for cardiovascular events in a
   defined region in western Germany during the government-imposed
   lock-down period.
   Methods
   We examined 5799 consecutive patients who were treated by emergency
   services for cardiovascular events during the Covid-19 pandemic (January
   1 to April 30, 2020), and compared those to the corresponding time frame
   in 2019. Examining the emergency physicians' records provided by nine
   locations in the area, we found a 20\% overall decline in cardiovascular
   admissions.
   Results
   The greatest reduction could be seen immediately following the
   government-imposed social restrictions. This reduction was mainly driven
   by a reduction in discretionary admissions for dizziness/syncope
   (-53\%), heart failure (-38\%), exacerbated COPD (-28\%) and unstable
   angina (-23\%), while unavoidable admissions for ST-elevation myocardial
   infarction (STEMI), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and stroke were
   unchanged. There was a greater decline in emergency admissions for
   patients >= 60 years. There was also a greater reduction in emergency
   admissions for those living in urban areas compared to suburban areas.
   Conclusions
   During the Covid-19 pandemic, a significant decline in hospitalization
   for cardiovascular events was observed during the government-enforced
   shutdown in a predefined area in western Germany. This reduction in
   admissions was mainly driven by ``discretionary{''} cardiovascular
   events (unstable angina, heart failure, exacerbated COPD and
   dizziness/syncope), but events in which admission was unavoidable (CPR,
   STEMI and stroke) did not change.}},

Volume = {{261}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Although reactive powder concrete (RPC) is a well-known composite that
   achieves high rates of compressive strength, its behavior during fire
   still questionable. This study investigates the mechanical
   characteristics of RPCs following exposure to high temperatures. RPCs
   were prepared using high quantities of cement, silica, quartz, and fine
   aggregates, very small quantities of water (w/c less than 0.25). The
   testing was carried out on five different RPC mixtures: control mixture
   (plain RPC), and four test mixtures (RPC with glass, steel,
   polypropylene (PP), and a hybrid of steel and PP fibers). RPCs were
   analyzed to explain the original and residual mechanical conduct and
   spalling during different temperatures between 25 degrees C and 800
   degrees C. After exposure to elevated temperatures, specimens were
   tested for compressive, flexural, and indirect tensile strengths.
   Appearance and color change, spalling, mass loss ratio, and ultrasonic
   pulse velocity (UPV) were examined as well.
   Compressive and tensile strengths for RPC's mixes and flexural strength
   for RPC with steel fibers and RPC with steel and PP fibers gradually
   increases when specimens heated to 200 degrees C. However, the strengths
   of all mixes begin to drop as temperatures rise.
   Although RPC with steel and PP fibers had a high loss of its original
   compressive, tensile, and flexural strength at 800 degrees C, this RPC
   showed the best performance regarding spalling resistance and mechanical
   characteristics compared to the other types of RPCs. Also, all RPC mixes
   showedincreasing in mass loss and decreasing in UPV with temperature
   increase until spalling or became doubtful. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative
   disorder. Rhodiola crenulata extract (RCE) has shown its protective
   effects on AD, however, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In
   this work, serum lipidomics was conducted to reveal the action mechanism
   of RCE on AD by HPLC coupled with Fourier transform ion cyclotron
   resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). The animal model of AD was
   reproduced by intrahippocampal injection of A beta(1-42) in rats. The
   novel object recognition test and passive avoidance test were performed
   to evaluate the protective effects of RCE on AD rats. The differences of
   lipid metabolism profiles in rats were evaluated by multivariate
   statistical analysis. Then, the potential lipid biomarkers were
   identified and the possible mechanism of RCE on AD was elucidated by
   metabolic pathways analysis. As a result, twenty-eight lipids with
   significant differences between the control group and the model group
   were screened out. With the treatment of RCE, 19 lipids in AD rats
   showed a trend of callback to the normal levels. The results of pathway
   analysis indicated that the protective effects of RCE on AD might be
   closely related to the regulation of linoleic acid metabolism,
   alpha-linoleic acid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism and ether lipid
   metabolism. In conclusion, this study provides a new perspective on the
   potential intervention mechanism of RCE for AD treatment.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to evaluate the influence of CYP2D6 activity and
   cachexia progression on the enantiomeric alteration of plasma tramadol
   and its demethylated metabolites in head and neck cancer patients.
   Fifty-three head and neck cancer patients receiving oral tramadol were
   enrolled. The plasma concentrations of tramadol, O-desmethyltramadol
   (ODT) and N-desmethyltramadol (NDT) enantiomers were determined. The
   CYP2D6 activity score (AS) and degree of cachexia progression were
   assessed according to genotype and the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS),
   respectively. The enantiomeric ratio of NDT was (+)-form dominant in all
   patients. CYP2D6 AS had negative correlations with the plasma
   concentrations of (+)-NDT and (-)-NDT. The plasma concentrations of
   (+)-tramadol and (+)-ODT were higher in patients with GPS 1 or 2 than in
   those with GPS 0. Lower metabolic ratios to NDT enantiomers were
   observed in patients with GPS 1 or 2. In patients with GPS 1 or 2, the
   plasma (-)-tramadol was associated with the incidence of central nervous
   system symptoms. In conclusion, CYP2D6 AS partially explained the
   contribution of CYP2D6 activity to plasma tramadol and its demethylated
   metabolite enantiomers. Additionally, cachexia progression elevated the
   plasma (+)-tramadol and (+)-ODT levels through the reduction of
   N-demethylation of (+)-tramadol.}},

   learning format. The article provides an outline and questions that can
   be applied to current teaching methodologies but will require ongoing
   teacher training. The difficulty in applying this outline is a possible
   lack of understanding of student-centered learning techniques, lack of
   time to train teachers and, possibly, teacher apathy towards online
   education. This article provides an adaptable framework schools can use
   immediately, and the effectiveness of its application should be studied.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic defects in ribosome biogenesis result in a group of diseases

   SBDS. Children with SDS have neurodevelopmental disorders; however, the
   neurological consequences of SBDS dysfunction remain poorly defined. In
   the present study, we investigated the phenotype of Drosophila
   melanogaster following knockdown of CG8549, the Drosophila ortholog of
   human SBDS, to provide evidence for the neurological consequences of
   reduction in physiological SBDS functions. The pan-neuronspecific
   knockdown of CG8549 was associated with locomotive disabilities,
   mechanically induced seizures, hyperactivity, learning impairments, and
   anatomical defects in presynaptic terminals. These results provide the
   first evidence of a direct link between a reduction in physiological
   SBDS function and neurological impairments.}},

Abstract = {{Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) is a standard physiological index
   of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but reflects emphysema
   and vascular abnormalities less sensitively than diffusion capacity for
   carbon monoxide (D-LCO). This study tested whether a disproportionally
   impaired D-LCO relative to FEV1 (FEV1 z-score>-3 and D-LCO z-score <=-3)
   is a common functional COPD phenotype associated with distinct clinical
   and structural features and the prognosis of two cohorts. The
   cross-sectional analyses of the Korea COPD Subgroup Study (KOCOSS)
   cohort (multicenter study in Korea) included 743 males with COPD whose
   D-LCO was available. The cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of
   the Kyoto University Cohort (single-center study in Japan) included 195
   males with COPD who were prospectively followed for 10 years. A
   disproportionally impaired D-LCO relative to FEV1 was observed in 29\%
   and 31\% of patients in the KOCOSS and Kyoto University cohorts,
   respectively. In the multivariable analysis, the disproportionally
   impaired D-LCO was associated with worse symptoms, shorter 6-minute
   walking distance, paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema on computed
   tomography, and reduced arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide pressures
   compared to the reference (FEV1 z-score>-3 and D-LCO z-score>-3). In the
   multivariable Cox proportional hazard model, a higher long-term
   mortality was observed in the disproportionally impaired D-LCO group
   than in the reference group (hazard ratio {[}95\% confidence interval] =
   3.09 {[}1.52-6.29]) and similar to the D-LCO z-score <=-3 and FEV1
   z-score <=-3 group. The disproportionally impaired D-LCO relative to
   FEV1 is common and associated with increased symptoms, emphysema,
   arterial blood gas abnormalities, and increased long-term mortality in

Title = {{The Impact of Education on Depression Assessment: Differential Item
   Functioning Analysis}},
Journal = {{ASSESSMENT}},
Abstract = {{A person's level of education can affect their access to health care,
   and their health outcomes. Increasing rates of depression are another
   looming public health concern. Therefore, vulnerability is compounded
   for individuals who have a lower level of education and depression.
   Assessment of depressive symptoms is integral to many domains of health
   care including primary care and mental health specialty care. This
   investigation examined the degree to which education influences the
   psychometric properties of self-report items that measure depressive
   symptoms. This study was a secondary data analysis derived from three
   large internet panel studies. Together, the studies included the Beck
   Depression Inventory-II, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
   Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Patient Reported
   Outcomes Measurement Information System measures of depression. Using a
   differential item functioning (DIF) approach, we found evidence of DIF
   such that some items on each of the questionnaires were flagged for DIF
   with effect sizes ranging from McFadden's Pseudo R-2 = .005 to .022. For
   example, results included several double-barreled questions flagged for
   DIF. Overall, questionnaires assessing depression vary in level of
   complexity, which interacts with the respondent's level of education.
   Measurement of depression should include consideration of possible
   educational disparities, to identify people who may struggle with a
   written questionnaire, or may be subject to subtle psychometric biases
   associated with education.}},

   Yeast and Human Cells}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Inter-organelle contact sites have attracted a lot of attention as
   functionally specialized regions that mediate the exchange of
   metabolites, including lipids and ions, between distinct organelles.
   However, studies on inter-organelle contact sites are at an early stage
   and it remains enigmatic what directly mediates the organelle-organelle
   interactions and how the number and degree of the contacts are
   regulated. As a first step to answer these questions, we previously
   developed split-GFP probes that could visualize and quantify multiple
   inter-organelle contact sites in the yeast and human cultured cells.
   However, the split-GFP probes possessed a disadvantage of inducing
   artificial connections between two different organelle membranes,
   especially when overexpressed. In the present study, we developed a way
   to express the split-GFP probes whose expressions remained at low
   levels, with minimal variations between different yeast cells. Besides,
   we constructed a HeLa cell line in which the expression of the split-GFP
   probes could be induced by the addition of doxycycline to minimize the
   artificial effects. The improved split-GFP systems may be faithful tools
   to quantify organelle contact sites and screen new factors involved in
   organelle-organelle tethering in yeast and mammalian cells.}},

   health care establishments among 1.7 million people in western Sweden}},
Journal = {{PRIMARY HEALTH CARE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Aim:
   The one-year prevalence of diagnosed nonspecific back pain in Sweden is
   not known. Thus, this observational register-based study aimed to
   evaluate this prevalence by using data from the Region Vastra Gotaland,
   inhabiting 1.7 million people.
   Methods:
   Data from 2014 to 2018 were extracted from the VEGA database register.
   This register holds all health data from the publicly funded health care
   establishments in Region Vastra Gotaland. Aggregated data are presented
   as the one-year prevalence of unique individuals diagnosed with
   nonspecific back pain (i.e., the ICD-10 code M54). Stratification by
   health care level, gender, age, and M54 sub-diagnoses were made.
   Findings:
   Between 2014 and 2018, the annual prevalence of diagnosed nonspecific
   back pain in public primary health care increased from 4.8\% to 6.0\%
   (26\% increase, P < 0.001, CI 25-27\%). In 2018, the one-year prevalence
   was 7.2\% among women and 4.8\% among men (50\% difference, P = 0.001,
   CI 49-52\%). The one-year prevalence increased by age, and the highest
   figure (11\%) was seen in the age group of 80-84. Low back pain, M54.5,
   was the most common sub-diagnosis. The one-year prevalence was
   significantly higher (P < 0.001) among women in all the M54
   sub-diagnoses.
   Conclusion:
   The one-year prevalence of diagnosed nonspecific back pain was 6\% in
   public primary health care in 2018 and has increased since 2014. Women
   were diagnosed considerably more frequently than men. Publicly funded
   rehabilitation efforts, as well as actions focusing on the prevention of
   back pain, is probably money well spent.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient therapeutic options are needed to control the spread of severe
   acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has caused
   more than 922,000 fatalities as of 13 September 2020. We report the

   neutralizing antibodies (S2E12 and S2M11) that protect hamsters against
   SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Cryo-electron microscopy structures show that
   S2E12 and S2M11 competitively block angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
   (ACE2) attachment and that S2M11 also locks the spike in a closed
   conformation by recognition of a quaternary epitope spanning two
   adjacent receptor-binding domains. Antibody cocktails that include
   S2M11, S2E12, or the previously identified S309 antibody broadly
   neutralize a panel of circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates and activate
   effector functions. Our results pave the way to implement antibody
   cocktails for prophylaxis or therapy, circumventing or limiting the

Title = {{The effect of the Affordable Care Act on Medicaid payments in long-term
   care facilities}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT}},
Abstract = {{Long-term care has been defined as a continuation of medical services,
   social services, and housing for patients with chronic health
   conditions, which have limited their abilities to partake in everyday
   activities. In the United States, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was
   enacted to expand coverage for Medicaid and to improve the quality and
   cost of healthcare. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact
   of the ACA on long-term care to determine if it has increased Medicaid
   payments. The methodology for this investigation utilized a literature
   review following a systematic approach utilizing 48 references and
   complemented with a semi-structured interview. It was found that the ACA
   has increased Medicaid payments, and the number of uninsured patients
   has decreased. With the implementation of the ACA, nursing homes and
   lifelong care facilities have been required through the ACA to meet new
   requirements that have made it easier to file complaints about the
   quality of care. This study also suggested a decrease in readmission
   rates with Medicaid and the ACA in long-term settings. The ACA
   implementation has increased Medicaid payments, and quality of care has
   been improved through a decrease of readmissions, ulcers, and falls in
   long-term care facilities.}},

Abstract = {{The development of sustainable, low-cost, green and efficient oil-water
   separation materials is an attractive and challenging work. Oil/water
   separation process has been achieved by a variety of materials with
   special wettability, but most materials require complex instruments or
   involve toxic and corrosive chemicals, which might lead to some
   potential economic and environmental issues. Our work proposed here is a
   novel super-hydrophilic, underwater super-oleophobic cellulose
   hydrogel-coated mesh (CHCM) which produced by deep eutectic solvent,
   aimed for efficient gravity-driven oil/water separation. Based on this
   pre-wet CHCM, the separation efficiency of various oil-water mixtures
   was above 98.0\%, and the results also showed that CHCM has good
   recyclability and durability, even after 20 cycles, the separation
   efficiency also maintained at 98.5\%. Impressively, the prepared CHCM
   also exhibited good salt resistance; it can separate a high efficiency
   pump oil mixture from a saturated aqueous NaCl solution. Through XPS
   analysis of CHCM, the oil-water separation mechanism is due to the large
   number of super-hydrophilic groups on its surface. This simple, green,
   and efficient method overcomes an important barrier to the safe
   separation of oil-water mixtures and provides insights into the design
   of advanced materials for practical oil-water separation.}},

Title = {{Greenhouse gas emissions from lignocellulose-amended soil treatment
   areas for removal of nitrogen from wastewater}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{744}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Lignocellulose-amended, layered soil treatment areas (STAs) remove
   nitrogen (N) passively from wastewater by sequential nitrification and
   denitrification. As wastewater percolates through the STA, the top sand
   layer promotes nitrification, and the lower, lignocellulos-amended sand
   layer promotes heterotrophic denitrification. Layered STAs can remove
   large amounts of N from wastewater, which may increase their emissions
   of CO2, N2O, and CH4 to the atmosphere. We measured greenhouse gas (GHG)
   flux from sawdust-amended (Experimental) and sand-only (Control) STAs
   installed in three homes in southeastern Massachusetts, USA. The
   Experimental STAs did not emit significantly more GHGs to the atmosphere
   than Control STAs receiving the same wastewater inputs, and both Control
   and Experimental STAs emitted more CO2 and N2O - but not CH4 - than soil
   not treating wastewater. Median (range) flux (mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) for
   all homes for the Control STAs was 7.6 (0.8-23.0), 0.0001
   (-0.0004-0.004), and 0.0008 (0-0.02) for CO2, CH4 and N2O, respectively,
   whereas values for the Experimental STAs were 6.6 (0.3-243), 0
   (-0.0005-0.005), and 0.0004 (0-0.02) for CO2, CH4 and N2O, respectively.
   Despite the absence of differences in flux between Control and
   Experimental STAs, the Experimental STA had significantly higher
   subsurface GHG levels than the Control STA, suggesting microbial
   consumption of excess gas levels near the ground surface in the
   Experimental STA. The flux of GHGs from Experimental and Control STAs
   was controlled chiefly by temperature, soil moisture, and subsurface GHG
   concentrations. Total emissions (gCO(2)e capita(-1) day(-1)) were higher
   than those reported by others for conventional STAs, with mean values
   ranging from 0 to 1835 for septic tanks, and from 30 to 1938 for STAs.
   Our results suggest that, despite a higher capacity to remove N from
   wastewater, layered STAs may have limited impact on air quality compared
   to conventional STAs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The TMC genes encode a set of homologous transmembrane proteins whose
   functions are not well understood. Biallelic mutations in either TMC6 or
   TMC8 are detected in more than half of cases of the pre-malignant skin
   disease epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). It is controversial
   whether EV induced by mutations in TMC6 or TMC8 originates from
   keratinocyte or lymphocyte defects. Quantification of TMC6 and TMC8 RNA
   levels in various organs revealed that lymphoid tissues have the highest
   levels of expression of both genes, and custom antibodies confirmed
   protein expression in mouse lymphocytes. To study the function of these
   proteins we generated mice with targeted deletion mutant alleles of Tmc6
   or Tmc8. Either TMC6 or TMC8 deficiency induced a reduction in apparent
   molecular weight and/or amount of the other TMC molecule.
   Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that TMC6 and TMC8 formed a
   protein complex in mouse and human T cells. MS and biochemical analysis
   demonstrated that TMC6 and TMC8 additionally interacted with the CIB1
   protein to form TMC6-TMC8-CIB1 trimers. We demonstrated that TMC6 and
   TMC8 regulated CIB1 levels by protecting CIB1 from ubiquitination and
   proteasomal degradation. Reciprocally, CIB1 was needed for stabilizing
   TMC6 and TMC8 levels. These results suggest why inactivating mutations
   in any of the three human genes leads to similar clinical presentations.
   We also demonstrated that TMC6 and TMC8 levels are drastically lower and
   the proteins are less active in regulating CIB1 in keratinocytes than in
   T cells. Our study suggests that defects in lymphocytes may contribute
   to the etiology and pathogenesis of EV.}},

   focus as evidenced by frequent customer service updates and coproduction
   prompts. Citizen involvement efforts were far less common; few cities

Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Phosphorus discharge in urban household consumption system has an
   important impact on the urban ecological environment, especially the
   surface water environment. In this study, a framework and its accounting
   model of phosphorus flow analysis in urban household consumption system
   by means of SFA (substance flow analysis) was constructed. Based on the
   accounting model, the flow of phosphorus in the urban household
   consumption system of Dar es Salaam was described quantitatively, and
   the results demonstrated: (1) the total phosphorus input, stock and
   output of urban household consumption system in Dar es Salaam were 4874t
   of P, 59t of P and 4815t of P, respectively. In terms of system input of
   phosphorus, residents' food consumption had a decisive impact on the
   system's phosphorus input (4765t of P, 97.76\%), while the contribution
   of detergent to the phosphorus input of the system was small. In terms
   of system phosphorus output, human feces and urine phosphorus output
   accounted for the majority of the total system phosphorus output (2313t
   of P, 48.04\%). The total phosphorus output of domestic garbage,
   wastewater and food processing loss were 1464t of P (30.41\%), 561t of P
   (11.65\%), 477t of P (9.90\%), respectively. (2) There were 2314t of P
   discharged into surface water through human feces and urine and domestic
   wastewater, which had a negative impact on the prevention and control of
   surface water pollution. 34t of P came from scattered garbage storage
   and 315t of P came from centralized garbage storage due to limited
   treatment capacity of waste treatment plant. Centralized storage and
   decentralized storage increased the risk of further phosphate loss. (3)
   Accelerated urbanization, rapid economic development and low sewage
   treatment capacity would cause more phosphorus loss, and Dar es Salaam
   faced great challenges in P discharge reduction and pollution control.
   Finally, we proposed policy recommendations for P discharge reduction
   including the guidance to the reasonable dietary structure with low
   phosphorus, the promotion of cleaning products with less phosphorus and
   no phosphorus, and the construction of garbage treatment and sewage
   treatment infrastructure. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of concrete reinforced with cellulose fiber (CTF),
   polyvinyl alcohol fiber (PF) and polyolefin fiber suitable for various
   spray (VS) are experimentally studied. The individual impact of single
   fiber as well as synergistic effect of hybrid fiber on axial compressive
   strength, splitting tensile strength and shear strength of concrete are
   investigated. Microstructures of fiber reinforced concrete specimen as
   well as its stress-strain relationship is also observed. The results
   show that CTF alone enhances axial compressive strength of concrete but
   weakens splitting tensile strength; VS weakens splitting tensile
   strength as well but has little impact on the other two strength; PF has
   a negative effect on all the three mechanical strength. Synergistic
   effect of hybrid fiber varies with dosage, and only with the appropriate
   fiber dosage can hybrid fiber has positive synergistic effect on
   mechanical properties. 1.5 kg/m(3) cellulose fiber with 1.0 kg/m(3)
   polyvinyl alcohol fiber is found to be optimal combination of CTF-PF
   hybrid fiber to achieve the best synergistic effect. Practical
   implications of CTF, PF and VS are also put forward. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {{Inter-spike mitochondrial Ca2+ release enhances high frequency synaptic
   transmission}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{599}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1567-1594}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Key points
   Presynaptic mitochondria not only absorb but also release Ca2+ during
   high frequency stimulation (HFS) when presynaptic {[}Ca2+] is kept low
   (m) by high cytosolic Ca2+ buffer or strong plasma membrane calcium
   clearance mechanisms under physiological external {[}Ca2+].
   Mitochondrial Ca2+ release (MCR) does not alter the global presynaptic
   Ca2+ transients.
   MCR during HFS enhances short-term facilitation and steady state
   excitatory postsynaptic currents by increasing vesicular release
   probability.
   The intra-train MCR may provide residual calcium at interspike
   intervals, and thus support high frequency neurotransmission at central
   glutamatergic synapses.
   Emerging evidence indicates that mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering
   contributes to local regulation of synaptic transmission. It is unknown,
   however, whether mitochondrial Ca2+ release (MCR) occurs during high
   frequency synaptic transmission. Confirming the previous notion that 2
   mu m tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) is a specific inhibitor of the
   mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (mNCX), we studied the role of MCR via
   mNCX in short-term plasticity during high frequency stimulation (HFS) at
   the calyx of Held synapse of the rat. TPP+ reduced short-term
   facilitation (STF) and steady state excitatory postsynaptic currents
   during HFS at mature calyx synapses under physiological extracellular
   {[}Ca2+] ({[}Ca2+](o) = 1.2 mm), but not at immature calyx or at 2 mm
   {[}Ca2+](o). The inhibitory effects of TPP+ were stronger at synapses
   with morphologically complex calyces harbouring many swellings and at 32
   degrees C than at simple calyx synapses and at room temperature. These
   effects of TPP+ on STF were well correlated with those on the
   presynaptic mitochondrial {[}Ca2+] build-up during HFS. Mitochondrial
   {[}Ca2+] during HFS was increased by TPP+ at mature calyces under 1.2 mm
   {[}Ca2+](o), and further enhanced at 32 degrees C, but not under 2 mm
   {[}Ca2+](o) or at immature calyces. The close correlation of the effects
   of TPP+ on mitochondrial {[}Ca2+] with those on STF suggests that mNCX
   contributes to STF at the calyx of Held synapses. The intra-train MCR
   enhanced vesicular release probability without altering global
   presynaptic {[}Ca2+]. Our results suggest that MCR during HFS elevates
   local {[}Ca2+] near synaptic sites at interspike intervals to enhance
   STF and to support stable synaptic transmission under physiological
   {[}Ca2+](o).}},

Abstract = {{Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) has become an attractive photocatalyst
   for solar energy conversion, but the photocatalytic activity of GCN is
   still limited by the extremely fast electron-hole recombination. Herein,
   a defective ultrathin mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (DUMCN)
   photocatalyst with high specific surface area and mesoporous structure
   is fabricated through a facile three-step heat-treatment strategy, which
   reduces the distance of bulk photogenerated carriers to the surface,
   resulting in efficient adsorption and diffusion of reactants and
   products, and exposing adequate surface active sites. Moreover, suitable
   N-vacancy defects are formed via high-temperature surface hydrogenation,
   which can extend light absorption and produce ultra-high intrinsic
   carrier mobility, and further increase the active sites. The
   photocatalytic hydrogen production rate is up to 13.63 mmol h(-1) g(-1)
   under visible light in the triethanolamine solution and 33.5 mu mol
   h(-1) g(-1) for overall water splitting, which is much higher than that
   of bulk graphitic carbon nitride (BCN) structures. Density functional
   theory (DFT) calculations further reveal the effect of surface defects
   on the band structure for promoting the spatial charge separation. This
   facile strategy may offer new insights into designing other ultrathin
   mesoporous semiconductor photocatalysts with high performance.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, a blooming flower-like BiOBr/BiOI was fabricated via
   solvothermal reduction-ion exchange method and its photocatalytic
   performance was evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation of
   levofloxacin hydrochloride in water under visible light irradiation.
   Morphology, structure, optical properties and some of the underling
   mechanism were revealed by multifarious characterization techniques,
   photoelectrochemical measurements, and active substances capture. It was
   shown that BiOBr/BiOI composite (S6) with molar ratio of 12:1 (BiOBr to
   BiOI) displayed higher photocatalytic efficiency than pristine BiOBr,
   BiOI and the composites at other molar ratios. The degradation
   efficiency of levofloxacin hydrochloride over the optimized composite
   reached 97 \% in 120 min, and even 75.9 \% mineralization rate was
   achieved in 180 min. However, the degradation efficiency was only 48.4
   \% and 2 \% over pristine BiOBr and BiOI, respectively. The enhancement
   of photocatalytic activity was attributed to the effective separation of
   photoexcited electron-hole carriers by the formation of BiOBr/BiOI
   heterojunction. Holes were proved to be the primary active ingredients
   that degraded levofloxacin hydrochloride. The strategies proposed in
   this work provide new ideas and methods for the preparation of other
   related materials and efficient removal of levofloxacin hydrochloride in

Abstract = {{Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a blood/bone marrow cancer, is a severe
   and often fatal malignancy. AML cells are capable of impairing the
   anti-cancer activities of cytotoxic lymphoid cells. This includes the
   inactivation of natural killer (NK) cells and killing of T lymphocytes.
   Here we report for the first time that V-domain Ig-containing suppressor
   of T cell activation (VISTA), a protein expressed by T cells, recognizes
   galectin-9 secreted by AML cells as a ligand. Importantly, we found that
   soluble VISTA released by AML cells enhances the effect of galectin-9,
   most likely by forming multiprotein complexes on the surface of T cells
   and possibly creating a molecular barrier. These events cause changes in
   the plasma membrane potential of T cells leading to activation of
   granzyme B inside cytotoxic T cells, resulting in apoptosis.}},

Abstract = {{Background The transcription factor capicua (CIC) regulates mammalian
   development and homeostasis. Growing evidence shows that CIC suppresses
   various human cancers by directly repressing the downstream
   cancer-related target genes. This study investigated the clinical and
   biologic significance of CIC expression in pancreatic cancer (PC).
   Methods The study reviewed 132 patients with PC who underwent curative
   resection. The patients were divided into two groups according to CIC
   immunoreactivity score by immunohistochemistry, and the associations
   between CIC expression, clinicopathologic characteristics, and
   postoperative prognosis were investigated. Moreover, the influence of
   CIC expression on the malignant potential of PC cells was assessed with
   cell proliferation, motility assays, and use of quantitative real
   time-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot on the downstream target
   genes of CIC in knockdown experiments. Results The low-CIC expression
   group showed a higher proportion of lymphatic invasion (72.9\% vs.
   53.1\%; p = 0.024), intrapancreatic neural invasion (94.1\% vs. 81.3\%;
   p = 0.021), and extrapancreatic plexus invasion (30.9\% vs. 7.8\%; p =
   0.0006) than the high-CIC expression group as well as significantly
   worse overall survival (p = 0.0002) and recurrence-free survival (p =
   0.0041) rates. Low CIC expression was an independent risk factor for
   poor prognosis (p = 0.038). Pancreatic cancer cells with knockdown CIC
   significantly enhanced cell motilities and cell cycle progression,
   promoted expression levels of ETV4 and MMP-9, and induced EMT.
   Conclusions The study elucidated the association of low CIC expression
   with a poor prognosis for patients with PC and suggested that the
   CIC-ETV4-MMP-9 axis might control PC progression.}},

Abstract = {{Appropriate land use planning plays an active role in soil and water
   conservation. Considering the financial investment and grain security
   limitations, land use planning practices should be applied focusing on
   the critical source areas (CSAs) rather than the complete region. In
   this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to
   identify CSAs for sediment control in the upper Huaihe River basin. A
   novel one-at-a-time removal approach was proposed which involves
   individually removing the land use planning programme at sub-basin
   level, after which the related runoff and sediment results were
   simulated by the validated SWAT model. Then, two influencing indexes
   (i.e., runoff yield and sediment yield) were used to evaluate the
   influences on runoff and sediment responses at the watershed outlet,
   caused by the removal of that land use planning programme. Finally,
   critical sub-basins for land use planning were prioritized based on the
   weighted average of those influencing indexes. Calibration and
   validation results showed that the SWAT model well represented the
   monthly streamflow and sediment at the watershed outlet. The
   Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values of monthly streamflow and sediment were
   generally greater than 0.75. Results of the integrated priorities
   revealed that the most CSAs affecting land use planning implementation
   were in sub-basin 11, which was not the sub-basin yielding the most
   sediment. The CSAs prioritization determined by the one-at-a-time
   removal approach can achieve a better erosion control performance than
   that identified by the simulated sediment loads, which can be applied
   widely in targeting CSAs for implementation of watershed conservation
   practices with limited investment and disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{A new category of magnesium oxychloride cement-based strain-hardening
   cementitious composites (MOC-SHCC) with high-strength and high-ductility
   is developed in this research. The eco-friendly and high-strength MOC
   mortar is used as the matrix and ultra-high-molecular-weight
   polyethylene (PE) fiber is deployed as reinforcement. The development of
   mechanical properties of the MOC-SHCC with the curing ages varying from
   12 h (h) to 28 days (d) is fully investigated and the
   high-early-strength characteristic of MOC-SHCC is demonstrated. The
   compressive, flexural, and tensile strength of the MOC-SHCC at ld reach
   71.4 MPa, 25.2 MPa, and 8.28 MPa respectively, accounting for 56\%,
   84\%, and 75\% of the corresponding values at 28d. The tensile
   capacities of the MOC-SHCC decrease slightly with the curing age, while
   all the values are beyond 6\% accompanying with the evenly distributed
   microcracks. Additionally, water resistance of the MOC-SHCC is
   systematically investigated by using an accelerating method through
   immersing specimens into 60 degrees C hot water for 7d and 28d at the
   curing ages of 1d, 3d and 28d, respectively. The developed
   high-performance MOC-SHCC features with high early strength, high
   ductility, and satisfactory water resistance, which would have a strong
   potential application in practical engineering. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The Cu-Cr-Ti and Cu-Cr-Ti-Si alloy ingots were melted in the atmosphere,
   and then treated with hot rolling-solid solution-aging-cold rolling
   process. Microstructure and properties of alloy after cold rolling with
   different deformation were studied. The microstructure of the alloy
   after cold rolling was analyzed by using OM, electron backscatter
   diffraction, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The
   results show that when the deformations is greater than 80\%, the
   hardness of Cu-Cr-Ti-Si alloy is decreased. Such phenomenon does not
   occur in Cu-Cr-Ti alloy. With the increase of deformation, the
   proportion of low angle grain boundaries in Cu-Cr-Ti-Si alloy is
   decreased, and the increase of dislocation cells and sub-grains leads to
   slight decrease of dislocation density. Since no re-crystallization was
   observed, recovery is responsible for work softening. By analyzing the
   microstructure before cold rolling, it is found that Si can refine the
   alloy grains, resulting in smaller grains of Cu-Cr-Ti-Si alloy than
   Cu-Cr-Ti before deformation. More grain boundaries per unit area provide
   more energy storage at nucleation sites for recovery during deformation
   of the alloy.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited
   bleeding disorder with a prevalence of 0.1\%, characterised by
   quantitative or functional deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF).
   VWD diagnosis is based on symptomology, biochemical and genetic tests,
   but limited laboratory resources and VWD heterogeneity still generate an
   important subdiagnosis gap worldwide and in our country.
   Aim To identify the type and subtype of VWD in a cohort of patients with
   a history of excessive bleeding in Western Mexico.
   Methods This prospective cohort study from 2012 to 2019 included
   patients with mucocutaneous bleeding or abnormal laboratory tests. A
   standardised questionnaire and confirmatory tests were applied: FVIII:C,
   VWF activity, VWF antigen, and VWF multimeric analysis.
   Results Of the 297 patients recruited, 207 (69.7\%) were excluded
   because their values exceeded 50\% in VWF activity and VWF antigen. Of
   those 90 remaining, 54 (18.2\%) had low VWF, and only 36 patients
   (12.1\%) were diagnosed with VWD. Among them, 17 (47.2\%) had
   quantitative deficiencies, of whom 14 were assigned as type 1 and 3 as
   type 3.The remaining 19 cases were diagnosed as type 2 (52.8\%): type 2A
   and 2B were the most frequent with 6 and 7 cases respectively; 4 cases
   were possible type 2M and two suggestive of 2N, however, this was not
   confirmed.
   Conclusion This study highlights the challenges of VWD diagnosis using a
   comprehensive panel of diagnostic tests which should extend to
   supplemental tests of VWF:CB, VWF:FVIIIB, and sequencing the VWD gene to
   confirm the results from the panel assays.}},

Abstract = {{Shewanella baltica is one of the most important bacterial species
   contributing to spoilage of seafood. Principally, RpoS has been
   recognized as the central regulator of stress resistance in many
   bacterial species. However, little is known about the role of RpoS in S.
   baltica. In this study, an rpoS mutant of S. baltica was constructed and
   analysed for its functions. The results showed that the survival rate of
   rpoS mutant decreased when treated with heat, ethanol and H2O2, while
   increased the resistance to NaCl. Moreover RpoS promoted the biofilm
   formation of S. baltica at 30 degrees C, while declined at 4 degrees C.
   Interestingly, the rpoS-deficient mutant showed increased swimming
   motility. Furthermore, the results revealed that the production of
   quorum-sensing (QS) signals such as cyclo-(l-Pro-l-Leu) and
   cyclo-(l-Pro-l-Phe) reduced in rpoS mutant. Mainly, rpoS positively
   regulated QS response regulators, as the expression of all luxR genes in
   rpoS mutant significantly decreased relative to wild type. This study
   reveals that RpoS is a major regulator involved in stress responses,
   biofilm formation and quorum sensing system in S. baltica. The present
   work provides significant information for the control of microbiological
   spoilage of seafood.}},

Abstract = {{Although three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence microscopy is an essential
   tool for life science research, the fundamentally limited optical
   throughput, as reflected in the compromise between speed and resolution,
   so far prevents further movement towards faster, clearer, and
   higher-throughput applications. We herein report a dual-stage
   mutual-feedback deep-learning approach that allows gradual reversion of
   microscopy degradation from high-resolution targets to low-resolution
   images. Using a single blurred-and-pixelated 3D image as input, our
   trained network infers a 3D output with notably higher resolution and
   improved contrast. The performance is better than conventional one-stage
   network approaches. It pushes the throughput limit of current 3D
   fluorescence microscopy in three ways: notably reducing the acquisition
   time for accurate mapping of large organs, breaking the diffraction
   limit for imaging subcellular events with faster lower-toxicity
   measurement, and improving temporal resolution for capturing
   instantaneous biological processes. Combining our network approach with
   light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate the imaging of
   vessels and neurons in the mouse brain at single-cell resolution and
   with a throughput of 6 min for a whole brain. We also image cell
   organelles beyond the diffraction limit at a 2 Hz volume rate and map
   neuronal activities of freely moving C. elegans at single-cell
   resolution and 30 Hz volume rate. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America

Title = {{Altered redox regulation and S-glutathionylation of BiP contribute to
   bortezomib resistance in multiple myeloma}},
Journal = {{FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{755-767}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Multiple myeloma (MM) cells have high rates of secretion of proteins
   rich in disulfide bonds and depend upon compartmentalized redox balance
   for accurate protein folding. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Btz)
   is a successful frontline treatment for the disease, but its long-term
   efficacy is restricted by the acquisition of resistance. We found that
   MM cell lines resistant to Btz maintain high levels of oxidative stress
   and are cross resistant to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducing
   agents thapsigargin (ThG), and tunicamycin (TuM). Moreover, cells
   expressing high/wild type levels of glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP)
   are more resistant than Gstp1/p2 knockout cells. In agreement, basal
   levels of S-glutathionylated proteins and redox regulation enzymes,
   including GSTP are elevated at mRNA and protein levels in resistant
   cells. GSTP mediated S-glutathionylation (SSG) regulates the activities
   of a number of redox active ER proteins. Here we demonstrated that the
   post translational modification determines the balance between foldase
   and ATPase activities of the binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), with
   Cys41-SSG important for ATPase, and Cys420-SSG for foldase. BiP
   expression and S-glutathionylation are increased in clinical specimens
   of bone marrow from MM patients compared to noncancerous samples.
   Preventing S-glutathionylation in MM cells with a GSTP specific
   inhibitor restored BiP activities and reversed resistance to Btz.
   Therefore, S-glutathionylation of BiP confers pro-survival advantages
   and represents a novel mechanism of drug resistance in MM cells. We
   conclude that altered GSTP expression leads to S-glutathionylation of
   BiP, and contributes to acquired resistance to Btz in MM.}},

Abstract = {{The potential mechanism of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) progressing
   to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains poorly elucidated. It has been
   proved that epigenetic alterations play crucial roles in the
   pathogenesis of cancer progression including MDS. However, fewer studies
   explored the whole-genome methylation alterations during MDS
   progression. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing was conducted
   in four paired MDS/secondary AML (MDS/sAML) patients and intended to
   explore the underlying methylation-associated epigenetic drivers in MDS
   progression. In four paired MDS/sAML patients, cases at sAML stage
   exhibited significantly increased methylation level as compared with the
   matched MDS stage. A total of 1090 differentially methylated fragments
   (DMFs) (441 hypermethylated and 649 hypomethylated) were identified
   involving in MDS pathogenesis, whereas 103 DMFs (96 hypermethylated and
   7 hypomethylated) were involved in MDS progression. Targeted bisulfite
   sequencing further identified that aberrant GFRA1, IRX1, NPY, and ZNF300
   methylation were frequent events in an additional group of de novo MDS
   and AML patients, of which only ZNF300 methylation was associated with
   ZNF300 expression. Subsequently, ZNF300 hypermethylation in larger
   cohorts of de novo MDS and AML patients was confirmed by real-time
   quantitative methylation-specific PCR. It was illustrated that ZNF300
   methylation could act as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and
   prognosis in MDS and AML patients. Functional experiments demonstrated
   the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic role of ZNF300 overexpression
   in MDS-derived AML cell-line SKM-1. Collectively, genome-wide DNA
   hypermethylation were frequent events during MDS progression. Among
   these changes, ZNF300 methylation, a regulator of ZNF300 expression,
   acted as an epigenetic driver in MDS progression. These findings
   provided a theoretical basis for the usage of demethylation drugs in MDS
   patients against disease progression.}},

   While most people want to live in a secure environment, we argue in this
   study that the support of policies to reach this goal depends on their
   necessity, extensiveness and reliability. Results from survey
   experiments in four European countries show that citizens are ready to
   approve the introduction of far-reaching state surveillance that
   includes measures of facial recognition and motion detection. Public
   support is further enhanced if these measures are to be targeted at
   potential criminals, rather than at all citizens (i.e., policy
   extensiveness), as well as if a safety threat is salient (i.e., policy
   necessity). Concerns about data security reduce support (i.e., policy
   reliability). While these conditions matter for the support of specific
   policies, they do not influence how trustworthy citizens consider
   government and other political authorities to be.}},

Abstract = {{In wheat, 25 Rht genes for dwarfness are known, which include both,
   GA-insensitive and GA-responsive genes. The GA-insensitive Rht genes
   have been widely used, although, their suitability under abiotic stress
   conditions has been questioned. This necessitated a search for
   alternative GA-responsive, spontaneous and induced dwarfing genes. We
   earlier reported an induced dwarf mutant ('dwarf mutant-3 `; 44 cm), and
   the mutant allele was named Rht4c allele (2BL). This dwarf mutant was
   not suitable for cultivation due to its extra dwarf nature. Therefore,
   we searched for naturally occurring QTLs, which would modify the
   phenotype of `dwarf-mutant-3 ` using `mutant-assisted gene
   identification and characterization' (MAGIC) approach. For this purpose,
   the `dwarf mutant-3 ` was crossed with a tall wheat cv. NP114 and
   homozygous mutant F-2 plants (similar to 25\% of the progeny) were
   selected, which were phenotyped for plant height and genotyped using SSR
   markers. The data were utilized for QTL analysis and plant height. Six
   modifier QTLs were identified on chromosomes 2A, 2B and 4A. Two QTLs
   each on 2A and 2B were responsible for increase in plant height
   (described as `enhancer modifiers'), whereas the remaining two QTLs
   located on 4A were responsible for reducing the plant height (described
   as `suppressor modifiers'). It was hypothesized that the enhancer QTLs
   could be exploited for the development of semi-dwarf high yielding
   genotypes containing Rht4c allele. This is the first study of its kind
   in wheat demontsrating that the MAGIC approach could be used for
   identification of modifiers of the mutant phenotypes of other traits for
   wheat improvement.}},

Title = {{Influence of Organized vs Non Organized Physical Activity on School
   Adaptation Behavior}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{It is now well-established that physical activity has positive effects
   on both physical and mental health. However, the influence of organized
   physical activity (i.e., programs controlled and supervised by a
   trainer) on school adaptive behavior of adolescents with disabilities
   and/or behavioral disorders remains unclear. School behavior adaptation
   involves the ability to learn, conform to school norms and manage school
   activities without major behavior conflicts. A cross-sectional study was
   conducted to test the differences between organized physical activity
   and non-organized physical activity in an after school program. Eighty
   Romanian adolescents were recruited and allocated to three groups: (a)
   with disabilities {[}Ds; N = 17, M-age = 14.55 years (SD = 1.16), 12
   males and 5 females], (b) with conduct disorders {[}CDs, N = 21, M-age =
   14.52 years (SD = 1.11) 16 males and 5 females], and (c) participants
   who had not shown signs of conduct disorders or disabilities {[}as a
   control group; N = 42, M-age = 14.2 years (SD = 0.46) 20 males and 22
   females]. Personality traits, school behavior, and sensorimotor
   coordination were assessed by using the Eysenck personality
   questionnaire-junior scale, school in-adaptability questionnaire scale,
   and Vienna Test System Sport (SMK-sensorimotor coordination test)
   respectively. Multivariate analysis of variance MANOVA (3 x 3) and
   discriminant analysis were used to examine differences between the
   psychological and sensorimotor coordination outcomes across three groups
   and three types of physical activity context: (a) organized physical
   activity, (b) non-organized physical activity, and (c) no physical
   activity. The findings indicate that not participating in an organized
   physical activity program results in a reduced level of physical
   mobility and consequently is associated with maladaptive social and
   psychological outcomes. Thus, we argued that attending in an organized
   physical activity program is more beneficial for participants with
   disabilities and/or behavior disorders, due to an increase in the
   probability of school integration and development of their motor skills.
   Clearly more research is needed in order to investigate these effects in
   neurophysiological levels.}},

   evidence-based practice: A mixed-methods study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   Despite the positive attitudes pharmacists have toward evidence-based
   practices (EBPs), its application in community pharmacies in Saudi
   Arabia is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to explore and assess
   EBPs by community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia when they dispense
   over-the-counter (OTC) medications for three minor ailments: diarrhea,
   cough, and the common cold.
   Research design and methods
   We used a mixed-methods approach consisting of two study parts. The
   first was a quantitative investigation that used mystery shoppers. Four
   researchers, posing as mystery shoppers, visited 214 randomly selected
   pharmacies in the Riyadh region of Saudi Arabia. They used 14 questions
   from a standardized checklist to examine EBPs by community pharmacists.
   The qualitative part of the study entailed three focus-group discussions
   with 13 pharmacists from different community practice settings and
   explored factors that affected the application of EBPs when supplying
   OTC medications from the pharmacists' point of view.
   Results
   The analysis indicated that 40\% of pharmacists dispensed OTC
   medications according to EBPs. Logistic regression analysis showed that
   one question, ``Describe your symptoms{''}, predicted the correct supply
   of OTC medications (p = 0.021). The qualitative section of the study
   identified nine factors that affected EBP. Some of these factors
   facilitated EBP, such as established patient-pharmacist relationships,
   some acted as barriers such as conflicts between available evidence,
   while other factors could either facilitate or hinder EBPs, such as the
   health literacy of the patient.
   Conclusion
   Given that dispensing OTC medication is a core function of pharmacists,
   this study uncovered low adherence to EBPs by community pharmacists in
   Saudi Arabia when dispensing OTC medication for three minor ailments:
   diarrhea, cough, and the common cold. Furthermore, this study identified
   a number of explanatory factors for this low adherence. Targeting these
   factors could help change the behavior of pharmacists and decrease
   undesirable outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Background Mutation of the tumour suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 is
   thought to cause early development of prostate cancer which has poor
   prognosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the expression of
   BRCA1/2 and correlate it with clinicopathological factors for patients
   with prostate cancer in uganda. Methods Retrospectively, we used
   immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of BRCA1/2 antibodies in
   tissue blocks of 188 patients with prostate cancer who were diagnosed
   between January 2005 and December 2014 in the Department of Pathology,
   Makerere College of Health Sciences. The Chi-Square test was used to
   determine the association of the categorical variables, whereas t-test
   was used to compare groups of mean of the variables in the study.
   Results Expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was found in 26.1\% and 22.9\%
   cases, respectively. Co-expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was found in only
   7.4\%. Gleason score was associated with expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2
   (P = 0.013, P = 0.041, respectively). Age was not associated with BRCA1
   and BRCA2 expression; P = 0.543, P = 0.091, respectively. Likewise, PSA
   was not associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression; P = 0.446, P =
   0.399, respectively. Conclusion BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins in this study
   were expressed more in cases with poorly differentiated prostate cancer
   than in cases with either well or moderately differentiated prostate
   cancer. Co-expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins in the same patient in
   our study was 3 times less than either BRCA1 or BRCA2 alone.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is an essential component present
   during the early stages of biomineralization of many calcifying
   organisms, which is used as a precursor of crystalline calcium carbonate
   phases. Here, we performed X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy
   experiments on ACC which show that the amount of adsorbed water has a
   strong control over its diffusive dynamics. Results of crystallization
   experiments under conditions of controlled humidity indicate that the
   adsorbed water is enough to spark crystallization of calcite. A direct
   proportionality is found between the relative humidity of the
   environment and the final size of the calcite crystals. Different
   hypotheses are made to explain this result, with the confinement within
   the amorphous matrix being the main suspect of controlling the size of
   the crystallites. Control of water activity and water content is,
   therefore, a possible way to regulate biomineral crystallinity both in
   nature and for the design of functional biomimetic materials.}},

Title = {{Narratives and Their Impact on Students' Information Seeking and
   Critical Online Reasoning in Higher Education Economics and Medicine}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The digital and information age has fundamentally transformed the way in
   which students learn and the study material they have at their disposal,
   especially in higher education. Students need to possess a number of
   higher-order cognitive and metacognitive skills, including effective
   information processing and critical reasoning to be able to navigate the
   Internet and use online sources, even those found outside of
   academically curated domains and in the depths of the Internet, and to
   solve (domain-specific) problems. Linking qualitative and quantitative
   research and connecting the humanities to empirical educational science
   studies, this article investigates the role of narratives and their
   impact on university students' information seeking and their critical
   online reasoning (COR). This study focuses on the link between students'
   online navigation skills, information seeking behavior and critical
   reasoning with regard to the specific domains: economics and medicine.
   For the empirical analysis in this article, we draw on a study that
   assesses the COR skills of undergraduate students of economics and
   medicine at two German universities. To measure COR skills, we used five
   tasks from the computer-based assessment ``Critical Online Reasoning
   Assessment{''} (CORA), which assesses students' skills in critically
   evaluating online sources and reasoning using evidence on contentious
   issues. The conceptual framework of this study is based on an existing
   methodology - narrative economics and medicine - and discusses its
   instructional potential and how it can be used to develop a new tool of
   ``wise interventions{''} to enhance students' COR in higher education.
   Based on qualitative content analyses of the students' written
   responses, i.e., short essays, three distinct patterns of information
   seeking behavior among students have been identified. These three
   patterns - ``Unambiguous Fact-Checking,{''} ``Perspective-Taking Without
   Fact-Checking,{''} and ``Web Credibility-Evaluating{''} - differ
   substantially in their potential connection to underlying narratives of
   information used by students to solve the CORA tasks. This analysis
   suggests that training university students in narrative analysis can
   strongly contribute to enhancing their critical online reasoning.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a
   widely used mental health screening instrument among children and
   adolescents and increasingly used by welfare professionals in Denmark.
   However, the psychometric properties of the SDQ-self report (SDQ-S)
   among vocational education and training (VET) students are unknown. We
   assess the structural validity, internal consistency reliability, and
   test-retest reliability of the Danish SDQ-S among these students.
   Method: The SDQ-S was tested twice in a sample of VET students (sample N
   = 486; mean age = 17 years) with 10 to 14 days in-between. Using
   separate analyses for men (n = 371) and women (n = 115), structural
   validity was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis; internal
   consistency was assessed using composite reliability (CR); and
   test-retest reliability using Pearson's correlation.
   Results: Overall, the results provide inconsistent support for the
   five-factor first-order model, especially among males. CR was acceptable
   for all five scales except for Peer problems (among females and males)
   and Conduct (among males only). Test-retest reliability was satisfactory
   for all scales among females but for only two of the five scales
   (Conduct, Hyperactivity) among men.
   Conclusion: Overall, the SDQ-S is a more valid and reliable instrument
   among females. Results suggest caution in using the SDQ-S among VET
   students, in particular males.}},

Abstract = {{Many Australian mammals consume seeds, but their role in seed dispersal
   has not been well explored. Here, we investigated the mean retention

   (Acacia acuminata, Dodonaea viscosa and Gastrolobium calycinum) likely
   to be consumed by quenda (Isoodon fusciventer) and woylies (Bettongia
   penicillata ogilbyi). Mean excretion times were 14 h for quenda and 24 h
   for woylies, but some seeds were retained in their digestive passages
   for up to 39.5 and 55.5 h, respectively. Viable seeds of all plant
   species were retrieved from both species' scats and only G. calycinum
   seeds ingested by quenda had a significantly higher germination
   percentage (62\%) than control seeds (34\%). Our results show that
   viable seeds are deposited in the scats of quenda and woylies,
   indicating that these species may play a role in seed dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Although heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI) represents a
   major health burden, underlying microstructural and functional changes
   remain incompletely understood. Here, we report on a case of unexpected
   MI after treatment with the catecholamine isoproterenol in an
   experimental imaging study in mice using different state-of-the-art
   imaging modalities. The decline in cardiac function was documented by
   ultrahigh-frequency echocardiography and speckle-tracking analyses.
   Myocardial microstructure was studied ex vivo at a spatial resolution of
   100 x 100 x 100 mu m(3) using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance
   imaging (DT-MRI) and histopathologic analyses. Two weeks after ISO
   treatment, the animal showed an apical aneurysm accompanied by reduced
   radial strain in corresponding segments and impaired global systolic
   function. DT-MRI revealed a loss of contractile fiber tracts together
   with a disarray of remaining fibers as corresponding microstructural
   correlates. This preclinical case report provides valuable insights into
   pathophysiology and morphologic-functional relations of heart failure
   following MI using emerging imaging technologies.}},

Abstract = {{A case of industrial contamination by microscopic fungi of a human
   recombinant immunoglobulin as a solution for injection was investigated.
   Flaky fragments of fungal mycelium were present in the test vials. The
   study was conducted by light microscopy, agar plating, and DNA analysis.
   Three isolates were identified including Cladosporium cladosporioides
   (occurring in plant debris and soil), Fomitopsis pinicola
   (wood-destroying fungus), and an ascomycetous fungus from the order
   Helotiales (saprotrophs and woody plant parasites). The appearance of
   these species in the pharmaceutical product could not result from
   biocontamination of the production line but might be caused by external
   contamination. Thus, it was found that outdoor air entered the sterile
   preparation bottling room. An internal investigation conducted at the
   production site established that employees once rudely violated the
   rules of aseptic conditions by opening a window in the bottling room.
   Accurate identification of the fungal contaminant species allowed plant
   downtime to be avoided and the root cause of the problem to be
   established.}},

Journal = {{POLITICAL STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{Which membership-based voluntary organizations constitutive of civil
   society such as parties, interest groups or service-oriented
   organizations keep their members active and which forms of activism do
   they cultivate? This article addresses this important question
   distinguishing two forms of `member activism': `member involvement',
   defined as members working for an organization, and `member influence',
   defined as members' participation in intra-organizational
   decision-making. Building on incentive-theoretical approaches to
   leader-member relations and resource dependency theory, we present a
   theoretical framework specifying distinct drivers of each form of member
   activism, which is tested using new data from four organization surveys
   conducted in four most different European democracies. None of the
   theorized factors has the same robust effect on both involvement and
   influence. Most notably, professionalization - reliance on paid staff -
   has a positive effect on involvement and a negative one on influence,
   stressing the need to distinguish carefully the different roles members
   play in civil society organizations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a second order differential pencil, namely diffusion
   equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions which includes conformable
   fractional derivatives of order alpha(0 < alpha <= 1) instead of the
   ordinary derivatives in a traditional diffusion operator, is considered.
   Firstly, the asymptotic formulae of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of
   the operator are obtained. Secondly, the nodal points which are the
   zeros of the eigenfunction of the operator are investigated. Later, an
   effective procedure for solving the inverse nodal problem is given and
   thus the potentials of the diffusion operator are reconstructed with the
   help of a dense subset of nodal points. Finally, an example to
   illustrate the theoretical findings of this study is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Research has shown that entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is positively
   associated with performance, but several context-specific features and

   obtained on a sample of 111 medium- and large-sized FFs, suggest that
   strong identity-based faultlines (IBFs) negatively moderate the EO-FF
   performance relationship, even within TMTs that are comprised only of
   family members, which are often viewed as homogeneous teams. Conversely,
   strong knowledge-based faultlines (KBFs) amplify the positive effect of

Title = {{Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Oral Direct-Acting Antivirals for Chinese
   Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objective All oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have
   shown excellent efficacy and safety in Chinese patients with chronic
   hepatitis C (CHC). However, the cost of DAAs used to be expensive;
   therefore, large numbers of patients had no access to DAAs in China.
   Recently, prices have been greatly reduced. The objective of this study
   was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir
   (LDV/SOF), sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL), elbasvir/grazoprevir
   (EBR/GZR) and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB) in Chinese CHC patients
   stratified by hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT), cirrhosis status,
   and treatment history. Methods On the basis of a Chinese healthcare
   perspective, a Markov model was constructed to estimate the lifetime
   costs and health outcomes of patients treated with different DAA
   regimens. Chinese-specific clinical, cost, and utility inputs were
   obtained or calculated from published sources and expert opinions.
   Costs, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and
   incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were reported as primary
   outcomes. Base-case analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted.
   Results At a willing-to-pay (WTP) threshold of US\$30,081/QALY
   (calculated by three times the GDP per capita in China), SOF/VEL was
   cost-effective in patients with HCV GT 1, 3, and 6 infections, and the
   probabilities that SOF/VEL was cost-effective were 9.7-75.7\%,
   39.1-63.9\%, and 35.6-88.0\%, respectively. For GT2 patients,
   noncirrhotic patients, treatment-naive patients, and
   treatment-experienced patients, LDV/SOF was the most cost-effective
   regimen, and the probabilities of cost-effectiveness for each of these
   groups was 92.1-99.8\%, 89.9-99.0\%, 61.6-91.2\%, and 99.3-100.0\%,
   respectively below the WTP threshold. The GLE/PIB regimen (12-week
   duration) was the most cost-effective in cirrhotic patients, whereas the
   probability of its cost-effectiveness varied with that of EBR/GZR
   (4.1-93.8\% versus 6.2-93.3\%) below the WTP threshold. Conclusions
   Overall, SOF/VEL and LDV/SOF regimens are more likely to be
   cost-effective among various subgroups of Chinese patients with CHC.}},

Title = {{Maternal plasma folate concentration is positively associated with serum

   trimesters of pregnancy}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Increased first-trimester low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) concentration
   has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as gestational
   diabetes. The B vitamins folate, B-6, and total B-12 are key for the
   methyl group-dependent endogenous synthesis of phosphatidylcholine,
   which is needed for lipoprotein synthesis, e.g., very low-density
   lipoprotein (VLDL), the precursor of circulating LDL-C. Maternal
   B-vitamin concentration usually declines across trimesters. Whether
   changes in maternal B-vitamin concentrations are associated with total
   cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and lipoprotein concentrations is
   unknown. Therefore, we explored the association between plasma folate,
   vitamin B-6 in the form of pyridoxal 5 ` -phosphate (PLP), and total
   B-12 with serum TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG concentrations across
   trimesters. This secondary analysis used data of a prospective pregnancy
   cohort study included apparently healthy adult women (n=179) from Rio de
   Janeiro, Brazil. The biomarkers were measured in fasting blood samples
   collected at 5-13, 20-26, and 30-36 weeks of gestation. The associations
   between B vitamins and lipid concentrations across trimesters were
   explored using linear mixed-effect models. Among B vitamins, only plasma
   folate was positively associated with TC (beta =0.244, 95\% CI
   0.034-0.454) and LDL-C (beta =0.193, 95\% CI 0.028-0.357)
   concentrations. The positive relationship of maternal folate and TC and
   LDL-C concentrations may indicate the importance of folate as a methyl
   donor for lipoprotein synthesis during pregnancy.}},

Title = {{Cost Avoidance: Not Everything that Counts is Counted}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BUSINESS LOGISTICS}},
Abstract = {{It is widely recognized that one of the purchasing function's primary
   objectives is to generate cost saving through cost reduction and cost
   avoidance as it works with the supply base to provide high quality
   materials and services on a timely basis. This research develops
   mid-range theory by incorporating empirical evidence and the tenets of
   agency theory to the specific domain of a purchasing agent working
   within an organization. This domain differs from other agency
   relationships because there are multiple principals with misaligned
   goals within the organization that influence how purchasing cost saving
   are counted and thus influence the impact of those savings on purchasing
   performance. Agency theory helps articulate propositions in this context
   by providing insight into how purchasing agents perform their
   organizational duties related to cost saving and avoiding cost
   increases. The focus is specifically on examining how the challenging
   area of cost avoidance savings are tracked, measured, and recognized.
   Case studies from eight organizations reveal that there is significant
   prospect for suboptimal performance due to the design of reward and
   measurement systems and the reluctance of purchasing to challenge these
   systems. However, this can be addressed through an investment in robust
   systems supported by top management and finance.}},

Abstract = {{Potato Virus Y (PVY) is well recognized world-wide as an important virus
   of potato with damaging effect on both the crop yield and quality.
   Recent research has revealed a wide range of PVY strain diversity and
   complexity. The high degree of PVY recombinant types reported in some
   areas, has intrigued investigation into the efficacy of tools used for
   strain identification. PCR and ELISA are routinely and reliably used for
   PVY detection, however, the degree of information reflecting strain
   genotypes by various identification tools is variable and incoherent.
   Overall incidence of PVY from different potato samples collected in
   2018/2019 in some locations in Egypt is estimated by RT-PCR to be 12\%.
   The most prevalent strain detected was of PVYN origin. Phylogeny
   analysis revealed high degree of relatedness to isolates from specific
   locations, which may indicate probable origin of the isolates.
   Identification of recombinant strains of PVYN origin by both M-RT-PCR
   and ELISA has indicated that PVYNTN, PVYN-Wilga and PVYN:O are the most
   prevalent recombinant types.}},

Abstract = {{Deficient myelination of the brain is associated with neurodevelopmental
   delays, particularly in high-risk infants, such as those born small in
   relation to their gestational age (SGA). New methods are needed to
   further study this condition. Here, we employ Color Spatial Light
   Interference Microscopy (cSLIM), which uses a brightfield objective and
   RGB camera to generate pathlength-maps with nanoscale sensitivity in
   conjunction with a regular brightfield image. Using tissue sections
   stained with Luxol Fast Blue, the myelin structures were segmented from
   a brightfield image. Using a binary mask, those portions were
   quantitatively analyzed in the corresponding phase maps. We first used
   the CLARITY method to remove tissue lipids and validate the sensitivity
   of cSLIM to lipid content. We then applied cSLIM to brain histology
   slices. These specimens are from a previous MRI study, which
   demonstrated that appropriate for gestational age (AGA) piglets have
   increased internal capsule myelination (ICM) compared to small for
   gestational age (SGA) piglets and that a hydrolyzed fat diet improved
   ICM in both. The identity of samples was blinded until after statistical
   analyses.}},

   Immunity in the Brain}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Trained immunity was recently discovered in innate immune cells and
   shown to facilitate the clearance of pathogens at the time of occurrence
   of the second insult. However, it exacerbates several aspects of
   neuropathologies, and proper therapy is needed to rectify this abnormal
   immune reaction. Mesenchymal-stem cells (MSCs) exhibit a distinct
   capability for brain repair but are associated with safety concerns.
   Extracellular vesicles derived from MSCs are a promising alternative
   therapy. In this study, we used lipopolysaccharides to activate trained
   immunity in the brain and examined the therapeutic potential of
   MSC-derived extracellular vesicles in mitigating the
   trained-immunity-induced exacerbated neuropathology. We found that
   MSC-derived extracellular vesicles showed comparable effects to those of
   MSCs in the mitigation of trained immunity in the brain. Moreover, the
   administration of MCS-derived extracellular vesicles mitigated the
   aggregated inflammatory responses in the acute stage of stroke and
   alleviated the trained-immunity-induced increased load of amyloid-beta
   in APP/PS1 mice. We further investigated the molecular machinery of
   MSC-derived extracellular vesicles and found that IL-10 is important for
   the mediation of the therapeutic potential of MSC-derived extracellular
   vesicles toward the alleviation of trained immunity. Our study indicates
   that extracellular-vesicle-based regenerative strategies might be useful
   to mitigate trained immunity in the brain.}},

Title = {{Effects of abamectin and acetamiprid pesticides on the survival and
   behavior of Scaptotrigona aff. xanthotricha (Apidae, Meliponini)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Pesticides have been described as a major cause of bee mortality, and
   thus are predictors of population decline and decrease in pollination
   services. Standardized tests with Apis mellifera are already common, and
   there is a need to create adequate parameters for the native solitary
   and eusocial species of stingless bees. In this study, we evaluated
   lethal dosages (LD50 and LD90), lethal time (LT), and sub-lethal effects
   (SLE) of two pesticides used in soybean crops, abamectin, and
   acetamiprid, in Scaptotrigona aff. xanthotricha. All tests were
   performed through contact poisoning. The LD50 and LD90 for acetamiprid
   were higher than those obtained for abamectin. Survival analysis of S.
   aff. xanthotricha exposed to LD90 indicated significant differences
   between pesticides. The LT50 under abamectin (8.25 hours) was
   significantly lower than acetamiprid (14.25 hours). Considering the PER
   tests, our results suggest that positive responses to food offerings
   were reduced by pesticide effects. It was also observed that only the
   acetamiprid affected the locomotion of the bees. Our results revealed
   that both pesticides are highly toxic to S. aff. xanthotricha and that
   acetamiprid was the most toxic for all parameters evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of photoinduced charge separation (CS) in electron
   donor-acceptor compounds is commonly limited due to fast deactivation
   processes, such as the excited-state internal conversion and ultrafast
   hot reverse electron transfer to the acceptor, charge recombination
   (CR). A traditional way to avoid undesired energy losses due to CR is to
   put the reverse electron transfer into the Marcus inverted region, thus
   effectively suppressing it. This method, however, is not generally
   applicable when considering CS from the second locally excited state
   because the driving force of CR to the first excited state is small, and
   thus charge recombination is ultrafast and efficient. In this paper, we
   study the kinetic features of CS/CR from the second locally excited
   state of the donor using a semiclassical stochastic model of electron
   transfer. Particular attention is paid to the CS efficiency as well as
   the influence of the polar environment and intramolecular high-frequency
   vibrational modes on the kinetics of the charge-separated state. The
   influence of a number of model parameters on the CS yield and the energy
   efficiency has been analyzed using the results of numerical simulations.
   Several simple practical recipes for creating molecular compounds with
   high CS yields have been suggested. Simulations have also revealed a
   strong and non-monotonous (double-humped) dependence of both the yield
   and energy efficiency of CS on the driving force.}},

Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Psoas muscle measurements are frequently used as markers of sarcopenia
   and predictors of health. Manually measured cross-sectional areas are
   most commonly used, but there is a lack of consistency regarding the
   position of the measurement and manual annotations are not practical for
   large population studies. We have developed a fully automated method to
   measure iliopsoas muscle volume (comprised of the psoas and iliacus
   muscles) using a convolutional neural network. Magnetic resonance images
   were obtained from the UK Biobank for 5000 participants, balanced for
   age, gender and BMI. Ninety manual annotations were available for model
   training and validation. The model showed excellent performance against
   out-of-sample data (average dice score coefficient of 0.9046 +/- 0.0058
   for six-fold cross-validation). Iliopsoas muscle volumes were
   successfully measured in all 5000 participants. Iliopsoas volume was
   greater in male compared with female subjects. There was a small but
   significant asymmetry between left and right iliopsoas muscle volumes.
   We also found that iliopsoas volume was significantly related to height,
   BMI and age, and that there was an acceleration in muscle volume
   decrease in men with age. Our method provides a robust technique for
   measuring iliopsoas muscle volume that can be applied to large cohorts.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, disease severity,
   and mother-to-child transmission of pregnant women with Chikungunya
   infection (CHIKV).
   Design Retrospective observational study.
   Setting Grenada.
   Population Women who gave birth during a Chikungunya outbreak between
   January 2014 and September 2015 were eligible.
   Methods This descriptive study investigated 731 mother-infant pairs who
   gave birth during a CHIKV outbreak. Women and infants underwent
   serological testing for CHIKV by ELISA.
   Main outcome measures Primary outcomes: composite pregnancy complication
   (abruption, vaginal bleeding, preterm labour/cervical incompetence,
   cesarean delivery for fetal distress/abruption/placental abnormality or
   delivery for fetal distress) and composite neonatal morbidity.
   Results Of 416 mother-infant pairs, 150 (36\%) had CHIKV during
   pregnancy, 135 (33\%) had never had CHIKV, and 131 (31\%) had CHIKV
   outside of pregnancy. Mean duration of joint pain was shorter among
   women infected during pregnancy (mu = 898 days, sigma = 277 days)
   compared with infections outside of pregnancy (mu = 1064 days, sigma =
   244 days) (P < 0.0001). Rates of pregnancy complications (RR = 0.76, P =
   0.599), intrapartum complications (RR = 1.50, P = 0.633), and neonatal
   outcomes were otherwise similar. Possible mother-to-child transmission
   occurred in two (1.3\%) mother-infant pairs and two of eight intrapartum
   infections (25\%).
   Conclusion CHIKV infection during pregnancy may be protective against
   long-term joint pain sequelae that are often associated with acute CHIKV
   infection. Infection during pregnancy did not appear to pose a risk for
   pregnancy complications or neonatal health, but maternal infection just
   prior to delivery might have increased risk of mother-to-child
   transmission of CHIKV.}},

Title = {{Cerebral cavernous malformation remnants after surgery: a single-center
   series with long-term bleeding risk analysis}},
Journal = {{NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to investigate the long-term bleeding risk of
   cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) remnants. A review of clinical,
   radiological, operative, and post-operative data of a cerebral cavernous
   malformation (CCMs) prospective database was performed. Fisher's exact
   test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used to assess differences between
   non-hemorrhagic and hemorrhagic CCM remnants for 14 variables. Recursive
   partitioning analysis was performed to assess the order of variables
   most associated with CCM remnant bleeding. Twenty-four patients out of
   126 had a CCM post-surgical remnant. Of these, 7 had at least one
   post-operative hemorrhagic event. The mean follow-up was 80.7 months
   (range 12-144). CCM post-surgical remnant bleeding presented mostly with
   acute headache (50\%) and focal neurological deficit (25\%); in the
   remaining cases, the hemorrhage was asymptomatic. Retreatment was
   performed in two patients, with surgery and radiosurgery, respectively;
   no treatment was performed in the majority of cases. All patients ranked
   as non-II, according to Zabramski classification, did not show any
   post-surgical bleeding. The presence of a pre-operative perilesional
   hemosiderin ring was highly significant in predicting post-surgical
   bleeding (sensitivity = 0.94, specificity = 0.88) and incorrectly
   predicted bleeding in only two of the 24 patients. This study provides
   an evaluation of clinical and radiological factors influencing the
   bleeding risk of a CCM post-surgical remnant in a homogeneous
   population. Perilesional hemosiderin ring and Zabramski Type II appear
   to strongly condition the bleeding risk of a CCM post-surgical remnant.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND There is a growing interest in increasing dietary fiber (DF)
   consumption because of the health benefits associated with this
   nutrient. Pulses are considered a good source of non-digestible
   carbohydrates. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility
   of substituting semolina with chickpea flour to increase indigestible
   carbohydrate content without altering the texture of the pasta.
   RESULTS Pasta was prepared by extruding semolina-chickpea blends. The
   protein and DF content in the cooked pasta increased with the chickpea
   level, with an important contribution of resistant starch (RS) to the DF
   values. The optimum cooking time decreased as the chickpea content
   increased, which was related to the degree of starch gelatinization of
   the raw pasta. The in vitro digestible starch content decreased with the
   chickpea substitution level, concomitant with the increase in RS
   content. In general, the texture of the chickpea-containing pasta was
   similar to that of semolina pasta.
   CONCLUSIONS Pending acceptability studies on these pastas may grant
   their promotion as good fiber sources, probably helpful in the fight
   against obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. (c) 2020

   Sensing in Robot Grasping}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Tactile sensing is an essential capability for a robot to perform
   manipulation tasks in cluttered environments. While larger areas can be
   assessed instantly with cameras, Lidars, and other remote sensors,
   tactile sensors can reduce their measurement uncertainties and gain
   information of the physical interactions between the objects and the
   robot end-effector that is not accessible via remote sensors. In this
   paper, we introduce the novel tactile sensor GelTip that has the shape
   of a finger and can sense contacts on any location of its surface. This
   contrasts to other camera-based tactile sensors that either only have a
   flat sensing surface, or a compliant tip of a limited sensing area, and
   our proposed GelTip sensor is able to detect contacts from all the
   directions, like a human finger. The sensor uses a camera located at its
   base to track the deformations of the opaque elastomer that covers its
   hollow, rigid, and transparent body. Because of this design, a gripper
   equipped with GelTip sensors is capable of simultaneously monitoring
   contacts happening inside and outside its grasp closure. Our extensive
   experiments show that the GelTip sensor can effectively localize these
   contacts at different locations of the finger body, with a small
   localization error of approximately 5 mm on average, and under 1 mm in
   the best cases. Furthermore, our experiments in a Blocks World
   environment demonstrate the advantages, and possibly a necessity, of
   leveraging all-around touch sensing in manipulation tasks. In
   particular, the experiments show that the contacts at different moments
   of the reach-to-grasp movements can be sensed using our novel GelTip
   sensor.}},

Title = {{Algal Growth at Environmentally Relevant Concentrations of Suspended
   Solids: Implications for Microplastic Hazard Assessment}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Hazard assessment of microplastic is challenging because standard
   toxicity testing is targeting soluble (at least partially) chemicals.
   Adverse effects can occur when test organisms are exposed to turbid
   environments in the presence of various particulate matter (PM), both
   natural, such as clay and cellulose, and anthropogenic, such as
   microplastic. It is, therefore, relevant to compare responses to PM
   exposure between the microplastic and other suspended solids present at
   ecologically relevant concentrations. This comparison is possible when
   reference materials are included in the testing of microplastic hazard
   potential. Here, we evaluated growth inhibition in unicellular alga
   Raphidocelis subcapitata exposed to different PM (microplastic, kaolin,
   and cellulose; 10, 100, and 1,000 mg/L); algae without added solids were
   used as a control. Also, aggregate formation in the exposure systems was
   analyzed using particle size distribution (PSD) data. At 10-100 mg/L, no
   adverse growth effects were observed in any treatments; moreover, algal
   growth was significantly stimulated in kaolin and cellulose treatments
   compared to the control. However, at 1,000 mg/L, all tested materials
   exerted growth inhibition, with no significant differences among the
   materials. Comparing PSD s across the treatments showed that both PM
   concentration and size of the particle aggregates were significant
   growth predictors for all materials tested. Therefore, at high
   concentrations, both natural and anthropogenic materials have a similar
   capacity to cause growth inhibition. Linking effects in unicellular
   organisms to microplastic fragments remains a challenge since plastics
   incorporate chemicals that may leach and elicit specific effects
   relative to the particulates. The use of reference materials in hazard
   assessment of plastic litter is needed to delineate these effects.}},

Title = {{The cosmological phonon: symmetries and amplitudes on sub-horizon scales}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{In contrast to massless spinning particles, scalars are not heavily
   constrained by unitarity and locality. Off-shell, no gauge symmetries
   are required to write down manifestly local theories, while on-shell
   consistent factorisation is trivial. Instead a useful classification
   scheme for scalars is based on the symmetries they can non-linearly
   realise. Motivated by the breaking of Lorentz boosts in cosmology, in
   this paper we classify the possible symmetries of a shift-symmetric
   scalar that is assumed to non-linearly realise Lorentz boosts as, for
   example, in the EFT of inflation. Our classification method is
   algebraic; guided by the coset construction and inverse Higgs
   constraints. We rediscover some known phonon theories within the
   superfluid and galileid classes, and discover a new galileid theory
   which we call the extended galileid. Generic galileids correspond to the
   broken phase of galileon scalar EFTs and our extended galileids
   correspond to special subsets where each galileon coupling is fixed by
   an additional symmetry. We discuss the broken phase of theories that
   also admit a perturbation theory around Poincare invariant vacua and we
   show that the so-called exceptional EFTs, the DBI scalar and special
   galileon, do not admit such a broken phase. Concentrating on DBI we
   provide a detailed account of this showing that the scattering
   amplitudes are secretly Poincare invariant when the theory is expanded
   around the superfluid background used in the EFT of inflation. We point
   out that DBI is an exception to the common lore that the residue of the
   total energy pole of cosmological correlators is proportional to the
   amplitude. We also discuss the inevitability of poles in 2 -> 2
   scattering amplitudes when boost are spontaneously broken meaning that
   such theories do not admit Adler zeros and generalisations even in the
   presence of a shift symmetry.}},

Abstract = {{Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as a kind of pluripotent adult stem
   cell have shown great therapeutic potential in relation to many diseases
   in anti-inflammation and regeneration. The results of preclinical
   experiments and clinical trials have demonstrated that MSC-derived
   secretome possesses immunoregulatory and reparative abilities and that
   this secretome is capable of modulating innate and adaptive immunity and
   reprograming the metabolism of recipient cells via paracrine mechanisms.
   It has been recognized that MSC-derived secretome, including soluble
   proteins (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases),
   extracellular vesicles (EVs) and organelles, plays a key role in tissue
   repair and regeneration in bronchopulmonary dysplasia, acute respiratory
   distress syndrome (ARDS), bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary
   arterial hypertension, and silicosis. This review summarizes the known
   functions of MSC-EV modulation in lung diseases, coupled with the future
   challenges of MSC-EVs as a new pharmaceutical agent. The identification
   of underlying mechanisms for MSC-EV might provide a new direction for
   MSC-centered treatment in lung diseases.}},

Title = {{Preschoolers' Induction of the Concept of Material Kind to Make
   Predictions: The Effects of Comparison and Linguistic Labels}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Analogical reasoning by comparison is considered a special case of
   inductive reasoning, which is fundamental to the scientific method. By
   reasoning analogically, learners can abstract the underlying
   commonalities of several entities, thereby ignoring single objects'
   superficial features. We tested whether different task environments
   designed to trigger analogical reasoning by comparison would support
   preschoolers' induction of the concept of material kind to predict and
   explain objects' floating or sinking as a central aspect of scientific
   reasoning. Specifically, in two experiments, we investigated whether the
   number of presented objects (one versus two standards), consisting of a
   specific material and the labeling of objects with the respective
   material name, would benefit preschoolers' material-based inferences.
   For each item set used in both experiments, we asked the children (N =
   59 in Experiment 1, N = 99 in Experiment 2) to predict an object's
   floating or sinking by matching it to the standards and to verbally
   explain their selections. As expected, we found a significant effect for
   the number of standards in both experiments on the prediction task,
   suggesting that children successfully induced the relevance of material
   kind by comparison. However, labels did not increase the effect of the
   standards. In Experiment 2, we found that the children could transfer
   their conceptual knowledge on material kind but that transfer
   performance did not differ among the task environments. Our findings
   suggest that tasks inviting analogical reasoning by comparison with two
   standards are useful for promoting young children's scientific
   reasoning.}},

Abstract = {{The catalysts used to catalyze the hydroboration of nitriles or
   carbodiimides usually have some disadvantages such as complex structure,
   high cost, large pollution of environment and so on. It is an important
   development direction to use the main group metals instead of the
   transition metals to reduce the costs and realize green catalysis. In
   this paper, using NaH or NaOH as a catalyst, an efficient reaction of
   nitrile or carbodiimide with pinacol borane (HBPin) has been achieved.
   It was found that 3.5 mol\% of NaH participated in the hydroboration
   reaction in a simple and effective method under slight solvent-free
   circumstances. In addition, intermolecular chemoselectivity
   hydroboration of nitrile and substrates with different functional groups
   was also investigated by employing three different catalysts. This
   reaction uses the inorganic alkali with simple structure, commercially
   available and low cost to synthesize organoborane compounds, which
   provides ideas for industrial development.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{When do nonequilibrium forms of disordered energy qualify as heat? We
   address this question in the context of cyclically operating heat
   engines feeding on nonequilibrium energy reservoirs that defy the zeroth
   law of thermodynamics into work. To consistently address a
   nonequilibrium bath as a heat bath in the sense of the second law of
   thermodynamics requires the existence of a precise mapping to an
   equivalent cycle with an equilibrium bath at a time-dependent effective
   temperature. We identify the most general setup for which this can
   generically be ascertained and thoroughly discuss an analytically
   tractable, experimentally relevant scenario: a Brownian particle
   confined in a periodically modulated harmonic potential and coupled to
   some nonequilibrium bath of variable activity. We deduce formal
   limitations for its thermodynamic performance, including maximum
   efficiency, efficiency at maximum power, and maximum efficiency at fixed
   power. The results can guide the design of new micromachines and clarify
   how much these can outperform passive-bath designs, which has been a
   debated issue for recent experimental realizations. To illustrate the
   practical implications of the general principles for quasistatic and
   finite-rate protocols, we further analyze a specific realization of such
   an active heat engine based on the paradigmatic active Brownian particle
   (ABP) model. This reveals some nonintuitive features of the explicitly
   computed dynamical effective temperature, illustrates various conceptual
   and practical limitations of the effective-equilibrium mapping, and
   clarifies the operational relevance of various coarse-grained measures
   of dissipation.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of cluster consensus with multiple leaders is called
   multitracking. In this article, a sort of multitracking of first-order
   multiagent systems with adaptive coupling strength is studied by the
   application of adaptive strategy, and the delayed relation between
   various leaders and clusters is considered. To reach the clustered
   multitracking goal, a novel pinning-like control protocol with adaptive
   approach is designed according to the properties of network topology. In
   addition, the structure of the networked system is a weakly connected
   digraph. Some conditions are derived to ensure that the nodes in the
   same cluster reach the consensus via tracking their leader, while
   leaders will keep a delayed relation with the settled leader node as
   time goes on to form the required delay consensus.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To describe findings on cerebral imaging in patients with COVID-
   19 and neurological symptoms at two German university hospitals.
   Materials and Methods Patients with COVID-19 and neurological symptoms
   and cerebral imaging (CT or MRI) were included. A chart review regarding
   neurological symptoms, COVID-19 and imaging findings was conducted.
   Results 12 patients (4 females, age 68 +/- 12 years) could be included.
   Three patients had acute findings. Two patients had acute and subacute
   cerebral ischemia, one patient had additional intracranial hemorrhages
   and presumed central pontine myelinolysis. One patient had presumed
   COVID-19-associated pansinusitis.
   Conclusion Findings on cerebral imaging in patients with COVID-19 are
   uncommon and nonspecific. However, cerebral ischemia is regularly
   encountered and patients should be evaluated for stroke symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{The Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-like kinase
   BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2), a major negative regulator in the
   Brassinosteroids (BRs) signaling, is involved in a variety of plant
   signaling pathways by interacting with novel substrates and plays a
   major role in cellular, growth and developmental regulation. Despite
   BIN2 functional studies including BR signaling related
   proteasome-mediated BIN2 degradation, the molecular regulating
   mechanisms and it's related the protein component for regulating BIN2
   degradation has not been completely known. This study aimed to i)
   identify BIN2 protein and its interacting partner from
   HA-Immunoprecipitation (IP) of the BL-treated BIN2-HA and bin2-6D-HA
   lines, using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
   and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
   time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) and
   ii) characterize relationships between BIN2 and interacting partner
   proteins. We generated transgenic plants constitutively expressing
   BIN2-HA, bin2-6D (BIN2(E264K))-HA, and BIN2KD (BIN2(K69R))-HA construct.
   IP of the HA-tagged bin2-6D/BIN2 protein followed by mass spectrometry
   identified F-box protein, BRASSINOSTEROID F-BOX 1 (BRF1) and BRF2
   containing the LRR and FBD domain, as interacting proteins with BIN2.
   Validation in vitro by yeast two-hybrid analyses further confirmed the
   interacting protein. These results, together with phylogeny and sequence
   alignments of BRF1 and BRF2 homologs multiple methods, suggest that
   f-box protein BRF1 and BRF2 play redundant or overlapping roles in
   regulating BIN2. It is likely that the BIN2 protein stability is
   controlled by BRF1 and BRF2.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Epidemiological studies during the early phase of the coronavirus
   (COVID-19) pandemics reported different level of people's risk
   perception in different countries. There is a paucity of data on
   perceived high risk of COVID-19 and associated factors in Ethiopia. We
   sought to assess the prevalence of community's perceived high risk about
   COVID-19 infections and associated factors among Gondar town community.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study was carried out from April 20 to 27, 2020 in
   Gondar town community, Northwest Ethiopia. Multistage cluster sampling
   technique was used to recruit 635 participants. Structured and
   pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect the data. Descriptive
   statistics, bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression were
   used to summarize the results.
   Results
   A total of 623 participants were considered in the analysis with a
   response rate of 98.1\%. The prevalence of coronavirus high risk
   perceptions of the respondents was found to be 23.11\% (95\% CI;
   19.80\%-26.43\%). Age above 45 years (AOR = 1.41, 95\%CI; 1.19-2.66),
   college and above educational level (AOR = 0.28, 95\%CI; 0.21-0.98), and
   poor knowledge towards COVID-19 virus (AOR = 1.57, 95\%CI; 1.09-2.23)
   were significantly associated with perceived high risk about COVID-19.
   Conclusions
   The prevalence of perceived high risk of COVID-19 was found to be low.
   Factors such as age, educational status, and knowledge about COVID-19
   virus were found to be independent predictors of perceived high risk
   towards COVID-19. Government and non-government organizations should use
   formal and informal means of educating the community.}},

Title = {{Evolutionary Maintenance of the PTS2 Protein Import Pathway in the
   Stramenopile Alga Nannochloropsis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{The stramenopile alga Nannochloropsis evolved by secondary endosymbiosis
   of a red alga by a heterotrophic host cell and emerged as a promising
   organism for biotechnological applications, such as the production of
   polyunsaturated fatty acids and biodiesel. Peroxisomes play major roles
   in fatty acid metabolism but experimental analyses of peroxisome
   biogenesis and metabolism in Nannochloropsis are not reported yet. In
   fungi, animals, and land plants, soluble proteins of peroxisomes are
   targeted to the matrix by one of two peroxisome targeting signals (type
   1, PTS1, or type 2, PTS2), which are generally conserved across kingdoms
   and allow the prediction of peroxisomal matrix proteins from nuclear
   genome sequences. Because diatoms lost the PTS2 pathway secondarily, we
   investigated its presence in the stramenopile sister group of diatoms,
   the Eustigmatophyceae, represented by Nannochloropsis. We detected a
   full-length gene of a putative PEX7 ortholog coding for the cytosolic
   receptor of PTS2 proteins and demonstrated its expression in
   Nannochloropsis gaditana. The search for predicted PTS2 cargo proteins
   in N. gaditana yielded several candidates. In vivo subcellular targeting
   analyses of representative fusion proteins in different plant expression
   systems demonstrated that two predicted PTS2 domains were indeed
   functional and sufficient to direct a reporter protein to peroxisomes.
   Peroxisome targeting of the predicted PTS2 cargo proteins was further
   confirmed in Nannochloropsis oceanica by confocal and transmission
   electron microscopy. Taken together, the results demonstrate for the
   first time that one group of stramenopile algae maintained the import
   pathway for PTS2 cargo proteins. To comprehensively map and model the
   metabolic capabilities of Nannochloropsis peroxisomes, in silico
   predictions needs to encompass both the PTS1 and the PTS2 matrix
   proteome.}},

Abstract = {{Solid dispersions of medamine and albendazole with water-soluble
   polymers (PVP, arabinogalactan) were obtained by mechanochemical
   technology to increase the aqueous solubility of poorly soluble
   anthelmintic drug substances. An analysis of solid dispersions of
   drug-polymer systems showed that their solubilities depended on the
   nature of both the drug and polymer. The aqueous solubilities of
   medamine and albendazole could be increased by greater than 50 and 27
   times, respectively, by varying the joint processing time with the
   polymers. An analysis of IR spectra and a comparison of them with
   published data suggested that intermolecular complexes were formed in
   these systems. Innovative anthelmintic drugs with increased solubility
   for medicine and veterinary medicine could be created by using the
   proposed mechanochemical technology for obtaining solid dispersions. The
   resulting solid dispersions had several advantages over conventional
   dosage forms, in particular, they were obtained in one stage, their
   preparation did not require excipients (dispersants, surfactants,
   wetting agents, etc.), and they were more conveniently used and

Abstract = {{The well-known epic chant of hudhud, performed in a number of central
   and southern municipalities of Ifugao province in Northern Luzon, is
   widely known to be sung in two closely related languages, Tuwali Ifugao
   and Amganad Ifugao, both belonging to Central Cordilleran languages of
   the Philippine group. Apart from the Ifugao languages, the province is
   also inhabited by speakers of three Southern Cordilleran languages:
   Yattuka, Keley-i and Kalanguya. Hudhud is also sung by the Yattuka and
   Keley-i, who perform it only in the Yattuka language. There is also some
   oral evidence of existence of a hudhud soloist from a sub-group of the
   Kalanguya people - the Itkak - who, reportedly, used to perform hudhud
   in her native language. This article deals with the available evidence
   of this most probably extinct hudhud chanted in the Itkak isolect, which
   has never been documented before and is highly likely to disappear soon.
   The situation warrants urgent fieldwork to gather further evidence for
   this oral tradition and document the linguistic variety in which it is
   reported to have been chanted.}},

Abstract = {{Lattice dynamics determines a number of important properties of solids.
   While computational methods with predictive power have been developed in
   this area, the task is still difficult for the complex compounds. We
   present a method for automatic on-the-fly generation of multicomponent

   ensures effective extrapolation to new atomic environments. The accuracy
   is then demonstrated on the example of the Yb-filled skutterudite
   compound YbxCo4Sb12, which is a family of the promising thermoelectric
   materials. Atomic displacements, vibrational spectrum, and lattice
   thermal conductivity were obtained and the effect of the Yb filling and
   ordering was studied as 700 K. The potential allowed us to reproduce
   fine features of the vibrational spectrum, as well as the reduction of
   the lattice thermal conductivity with filling. We found only a small
   effect of the disorder on the vibrational spectrum and the thermal
   conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Beetle fossils are a rich source of information about the
   palaeodiversity and evolutionary history of the order Coleoptera.
   Despite the increasing rate of fossil research on click-beetles
   (Coleoptera: Elateridae), the most diverse group in the superfamily
   Elateroidea, their fossil record has remained largely unstudied. This
   may be caused by the combination of their rather uniform external
   morphology and the suboptimal state of preservation and visibility in
   most fossil specimens. Here, we used X-ray micro-computed tomography to
   reconstruct the morphology of an interesting click-beetle from Eocene
   Baltic amber, which had some principal diagnostic characters obscured by
   opaque bubbles and body position. Our results suggest that the newly
   described Baltelater bipectinatus gen. et sp. nov. belongs to tribe
   Protelaterini within subfamily Lissominae. Since Protelaterini have a
   predominantly Gondwanan distribution, our discovery is of a great
   importance for the historical biogeography of the group. Very
   distinctive are the bipectinate antennae with 11 antennomeres and with
   rami beginning on antennomere IV, which are not found in any recent
   Elateridae. The discovery of a new click-beetle lineage from European
   Eocene amber sheds further light on the palaeodiversity and historical
   diversification of the family as well as on the composition of the
   extinct amber forest ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the interfacial adhesion of PA6/PP-g-MA in a
   thin-walled multilayer part obtained by injection overmoulding. This
   process is a good solution to the need of weight reduction for the
   sustainable and economic growth of food packaging. A rigid plastic food
   package is a complex multilayer structure obtained from the association
   of polymers with different properties to achieve good barrier,
   environment, or thermo-mechanical performance. The present study aims to
   obtain a complete understanding of the interfacial adhesion of
   PA6/PP-g-MA interface in a three-layer PA6/sealant/PP assembly through
   microscopy analysis, mechanical characterization, and inter-diffusion
   models. Optical microscopy, XPS, and AFM analyses showed the presence of
   a copolymer interphase. This layer is greatly dependent on the holding
   pressure applied, which revealed to be the key parameter to obtain the
   best results in terms of failure strength. A better interface
   wettability improves the inter-diffusion distance and thus chemical
   grafting efficiency. Other interface improvements were achieved by the
   addition of EVA in the PP-g-MA layer. The lowest viscosity of the EVA
   dispersed phase has led to a fully cohesive failure due to an interface
   diffusion efficiency. The presence of EVA increased more than 80\% of
   the peeling performance of the assemblies.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To determine the safety and effectiveness of a peripheral
   artery chronic total occlusion (CTO) crossing catheter following failed
   crossing attempts with standard guidewires.
   Background CTO crossing remains a challenge during peripheral artery
   interventions.
   Methods In this prospective, international, single-arm study, patients
   with a peripheral artery CTO that was uncrossable with standard
   guidewires were treated with a crossing catheter (Wingman, Reflow
   Medical). The primary efficacy endpoint of CTO crossing success was
   compared to a performance goal of 70.7\%. The primary composite safety
   endpoint (major adverse event {[}MAE], clinically significant
   perforation or embolization, or grade C or greater dissection) was
   assessed over a 30-day follow-up period and compared to a performance
   goal of 13.0\%.
   Results A total of 85 patients were treated using the Wingman catheter
   for peripheral artery CTO crossing. Key patient characteristics were
   mean age of 71 +/- 9 years, 66\% male, and mean lesion length of 188 +/-
   94 mm in the superficial femoral artery (71\%), popliteal artery (15\%),
   or infrapopliteal arteries (14\%). Both primary endpoints of the trial
   were met3/4CTO crossing success was 90\% (lower confidence limit=82.5\%)
   and 5 primary safety events occurred in 4 (4.8\%) patients (upper
   confidence limit=10.7\%). Over 30 days of follow-up, Rutherford score
   decreased by at least 2 categories in 74\% patients; the percentage of
   patients with normal hemodynamics assessed with the ankle-brachial index
   increased from 1\% to 51\%.
   Conclusions Among patients with a CTO that was unable to be crossed with
   a standard guidewire, the Wingman catheter was able to cross 90\% of
   occlusions with a favorable safety profile.}},

Abstract = {{Theorists of the African centered perspective propose that constructs

   developmental outcomes amongst Black American youth. However, empirical
   research has not kept pace with the theoretical and conceptual

   African centered approaches to youth development remains faintly

   African centered constructs of Black youth development, the purpose of
   this study was to (1) develop an African centered scale of self-regard
   derived from the indigenous African perspective of the Bantu people and
   (2) test the African centered hypothesis that self-regard amongst
   African American youth is associated with perceptions of belonging with
   other members of their ethnic group. The findings were
   promising-however, more psychometric work is needed to investigate
   further the relationship between African centered constructs and
   subsequent relationship with positive development amongst Black youth.}},

Abstract = {{6,8-Diprenylorobol is a phytochemical derived from the roots of
   Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. 6,8-Diprenylorobol exhibits several
   biological activities, but the effects of 6,8-diprenylorobol on cancers
   have been hardly investigated. This study is aimed at elucidating the
   anticancer effect and working mechanism of 6,8-diprenylorobol in HepG2
   and Huh-7, two kinds of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines.
   WST-1, cell counting, and colony formation assays and morphological
   change analysis showed that 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment decreased the
   cell viability and proliferation rate. Cell cycle analysis indicated
   that 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment increased the population of the G1/0
   stage. Annexin V/PI double staining and TUNEL analysis showed that
   6,8-diprenylorobol treatment increased the apoptotic cell population and
   DNA fragmentation. Western blot analysis showed that 6,8-diprenylorobol
   treatment increased the expression of cleaved PARP1, cleaved caspase-3,
   FOXO3, Bax, Bim, p21, and p27 but decreased the expression of Bcl2 and
   BclXL. Interestingly, 6,8-diprenylorobol inhibited CYP2J2-mediated
   astemizole O-demethylation and ebastine hydroxylase activities with Ki
   values of 9.46 and 2.61 mu M, respectively. CYP2J2 siRNA transfection
   enhanced the anticancer effect of 6,8-diprenylorobol in HepG2 and Huh-7
   cells through the downregulation of CYP2J2 protein expression and
   upregulation of FOXO3. Taken together, this study proposes that
   6,8-diprenylorobol treatment may be a useful therapeutic option against
   HCC by targeting CYP2J2 and FOXO3.}},

Title = {{Neonatal outcome of second-stage cesarean delivery versus vacuum
   extraction among neonates <34 weeks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL \& NEONATAL MEDICINE}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   Among deliveries <34 weeks, there is inconclusive evidence regarding the
   preferred route of delivery when there is a need to expedite delivery
   during the second stage of labor. As it is unreasonable that future
   randomized controlled trials will be conducted to settle this query,
   every clinical data concerning this topic, may be helpful. We aim to
   compare neonatal outcomes among women undergoing emergent cesarean
   delivery (ECD) versus vacuum-assisted delivery (VAD) during the second
   stage of labor among singleton gestations Methods
   A retrospective cohort study including all women who underwent either
   ECD or VAD at the second stage of labor between 30 degrees(/7) and
   33(6/7 )weeks, during 2011-2019. The primary outcome was the rate of
   adverse neonatal outcomes, defined as intrapartum death, mechanical
   ventilation, asphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome, subgaleal
   hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and
   phototherapy.
   Results
   Of the 153,672 live singleton deliveries during the study period, 2871
   (1.9\%) delivered before 34 degrees(/7). Of those 1674 (58.3\%)
   delivered vaginally unassisted and 1137 (39.6\%) delivered by a CD
   during the first stage of labor. A total of 60 deliveries were analyzed,
   with a median gestational age of 32 weeks, interquartile range (IQR)
   31-33. Median birth weight at delivery was 1845 g, IQR 1574-2095.
   Overall 25 (42\%) of women were delivered by VAD and 35 by CD (58\%).
   Indications for expeditious delivery did not differ between the study
   groups. Neonates delivered by VAD had a higher median birth weight (1940
   vs. 1620 g, p = .02). Second stage of labor was longer in the ECD group
   as compared to the VAD group (median 200 vs. 52 min, p = .01). The rate
   of Apgar score at 1 min <7 was higher among the CD group (10 (40\%) vs.
   5 (14\%), OR {[}95\% CI]: 4.0 (1.1-13.8), p = .03). Longer length of
   stay was evident in the CD group as compared to the VAD group (median 30
   vs. 21 days, p = .001). The rate of composite neonatal adverse outcome
   was comparable between the study groups. Adverse outcomes were
   associated with lower body mass index (median 27.7 vs. 34.9, p = .04),
   higher rate of premature preterm rupture of membranes (40 (91\%) vs. 5
   (31\%), OR {[}95\% CI]: 22.0 (5.0-91.1), p < .001) and labor dystocia as
   the indication for expedited delivery (38 (86\%) vs. 7 (44\%), OR
   {[}95\% CI]: 8.1 (2.1-30.1), p = .001).
   Conclusions
   Cesarean delivery during the second stage of labor of gestations
   Synopsis
   Delivery by second stage CD of premature neonates <34 weeks is
   associated with a higher rate of lower Apgar score.}},

Abstract = {{Single Particle Imaging (SPI) with intense coherent X-ray pulses from
   X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) has the potential to produce
   molecular structures without the need for crystallization or freezing.
   Here we present a dataset of 285,944 diffraction patterns from
   aerosolized Coliphage PR772 virus particles injected into the
   femtosecond X-ray pulses of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS).
   Additional exposures with background information are also deposited. The
   diffraction data were collected at the Atomic, Molecular and Optical
   Science Instrument (AMO) of the LCLS in 4 experimental beam times during
   a period of four years. The photon energy was either 1.2 or 1.7keV and
   the pulse energy was between 2 and 4 mJ in a focal spot of about 1.3 mu
   m x 1.7 mu m full width at half maximum (FWHM). The X-ray laser pulses
   captured the particles in random orientations. The data offer insight
   into aerosolised virus particles in the gas phase, contain information
   relevant to improving experimental parameters, and provide a basis for
   developing algorithms for image analysis and reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature swing adsorption (TSA) has great potential for CO2 capture.
   However, the limited energy efficiency and time-consuming procedure have
   impeded its applications. Herein, we provide a promising solution by in
   situ electromagnetic induction heating for TSA-based CO2 capture
   (EMIH-CO2-TSA). The magnetic adsorbents are fabricated by growing
   magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles in N-doped porous carbon (NPC). With a
   large surface area, N doping, and highly dispersed Fe3O4 nanoparticles
   (less than 50 nm), the obtained Fe3O4/NPC-15 exhibits a high CO2
   adsorption capacity of 2.64 mmol g(-1) at 1 bar, a saturation
   magnetization of 15.51 emu g(-1), and an average heat capacity of 1.71 J
   g(-1) K-1. Using the optimized fixed target temperature heating mode on
   the self-established EMIH device, Fe3O4/NPC-15 exhibits an excellent
   EMIH-CO2-TSA performance, where the CO2 desorption rate and the energy
   efficiency are as high as 3.27 mg s(-1 )and 79.2\%, respectively, at 110
   degrees C and 1 bar, surpassing the trade-off between them. Being the

   efficiency of EMIH-CO2-TSA is much better than that of the conventional
   convective-heat-transfer TSA, which provides a promising alternative

Abstract = {{Lanthanide-doped photon upconversion systems are widely used to convert
   two or more low-energy photons into one high-energy photon. Theoretical
   upconversion models are needed to further understand the upconversion
   luminescence dynamics and improve photonic systems. Existing macroscopic
   and microscopic models still have limitations when analyzing
   upconversion systems with finite energy migration (EM) or time-dependent
   energy-transfer (ET) rates. This paper presents a macroscopic
   energy-transfer model based on the ion-pair microscopic state
   probability in an upconversion system. The model uses the microscopic
   dynamic state probability of ion pairs to predict the time-dependent
   macroscopic energy-transfer rates. The model gives the intrinsic
   microscopic and macroscopic parameters for the energy-transfer rates for
   upconversion systems where the EM process may or may not be infinitely
   fast. The model is verified against experimental data for single-doped
   systems of beta-NaYF4:Er3+. The emission decay curves of the
   beta-NaYF4:Er3+ samples with various Er3+ dopant concentrations were
   experimentally measured when excited by a 1.5 mu m pulsed laser to
   determine the microscopic resonant energy-transfer parameters and the
   macroscopic energy-transfer rate. This work provides a theoretical
   method to determine the microscopic intrinsic energy-transfer parameters
   of widely used upconversion luminescence systems.}},

Abstract = {{Cereal cyst nematodes are sedentary biotrophic endoparasites that
   secrete effector proteins into plant tissues to transit normal cells
   into specialized feeding sites and suppress plant defenses. To
   understand the function of nematode effectors in Heterodera avenae,
   here, we identified a calreticulin protein HaCRT1, which could suppress
   the cell death induced by Bax when expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana.
   HaCRT1 is synthetized in the subventral gland cells of pre-parasitic
   second-stage nematodes. Real-time PCR assays indicated that the
   expression of HaCRT1 was highest in parasitic second-stage juveniles.
   The expression of an HaCRT1-RFP fusion in N. benthamiana revealed that
   it was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum of the plant cell. The
   ability of H. avenae infecting plants was significantly reduced when
   HaCRT1 was knocked down by RNA interference in vitro. Arabidopsis
   thaliana plants expressing HaCRT1 were more susceptible than wild-type
   plants to Pseudomonas syringae. The induction of defense-related genes,
   PAD4, WRKY33, FRK1, and WRKY29, after treatment with flg22 was
   suppressed in HaCRT1-transgenic plants. Also, the ROS accumulation
   induced by flg22 was reduced in the HaCRT1-transgenic plants compared to
   wild-type plants. HaCRT1 overexpression increased the cytosolic Ca2+
   concentration in A. thaliana. These data suggested that HaCRT1 may
   contribute to the pathogenicity of H. avenae by suppressing host basal
   defense.}},

Title = {{Aqueous CO2 Foam Armored by Particulate Matter from Flue Gas for
   Mobility Control in Porous Media}},

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2) is injected into reservoirs for enhanced oil
   recovery worldwide, which is an important technology to reduce carbon
   emissions from burning and consumption of fossil fuels. However, it is
   difficult to control the mobility of carbon dioxide in the formation,
   thus limiting its extensive utilization. In this work, particulate
   matter (PM) from flue gas was used to obtain an interfacial armored foam
   for controlling the CO2 mobility in porous media. Both homogeneous and
   heterogeneous porous model experiments were adopted to study CO2 foam
   flow behavior in porous media. Furthermore, the viscosity, interfacial
   viscoelasticity, and microstructure of foam were measured to help
   understand the mobility control mechanism. The results showed that the
   interfacial adsorption and compression of PM formed a particle armor on
   the CO2-liquid interface, which improved foam film roughness and changed
   the interface to be more solid-like. Consequently, the viscosity of CO2
   foams was increased by 2-13 times with the addition of 1.2 wt. \% PM. In
   pore scale, the PM armored foams had stronger Jamin resistance and
   slipping resistance than bare surfactant foam. Thus, they showed
   relatively low mobility in porous media. The CO2 gas channel and water
   breakthrough were inhibited by the injection of 1 PV armored foams. The
   armored foams showed a higher resistance to the water flushing during
   the subsequent water flooding. The use of bare PM dispersions did not
   establish an effective flow resistance in the porous media. However,
   when a lower CO2 content (20\% foam quality) was co-injected with the
   liquid phase, the improvement of foam resistance factor by adding PM was
   about 3 times upon addition of PM. Moreover, in the heterogeneous porous
   model, the mobility of fluids in the high permeability sandpack was
   effectively controlled by the armored foam, thus increasing the sweeping
   efficiency in the medium and low permeability sandpacks. Compared with
   bare surfactant foam flooding, the oil recovery by using armored foam
   was increased by about 21.3\%. After flooding with armored foams, the
   residual resistance factors of armored foams were reduced to a lower
   level by enough subsequent water flooding, indicating the temporary
   plugging and low damage of armored foams in porous media. The
   significance of this research is the utilization of two important
   atmospheric pollutants by an inexpensive Pickering foam method for
   petroleum development and carbon sequestration.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate matrix metalloproteinases
   (MMP) -2 and MMP-3 in serum, and keratinocyte-derived chemoattractant
   (KC), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant 1 (MCP-1) in
   synovial fluid (SF) as stifle osteoarthritis (OA) biomarkers in dogs.
   Dogs with naturally occurring cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) rupture
   (OA group) and healthy controls were recruited. Stifles with CrCL
   deficiency were surgically stabilized. Serum, SF, and synovial biopsy
   samples were collected from the OA group preoperatively, whereas samples
   were collected once from control dogs. A blinded veterinary pathologist
   graded synovial biopsies. Serum and SF analyses were performed using
   xMAP technology. General linear regression was used for statistical
   comparisons of serum biomarkers, and mixed linear regression for SF
   biomarkers and temporal concentration changes. The overall
   discriminative ability was quantified using area under curve (AUC).
   Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess correlations
   between synovial histology grades and the biomarkers. Samples from 62
   dogs in the OA group and 50 controls were included. The MMP-2 and MMP-3
   concentrations between the OA and control groups were not significantly
   different, and both with an AUC indicating a poor discriminative
   ability. All three SF biomarker concentrations were significantly
   different between the OA group and controls (P < 0.05). The MCP-1 was
   the only biomarker showing an acceptable discriminative performance with
   an AUC of 0.91 (95\% confidence interval: 0.83-0.98). The sum of the
   inflammatory infiltrate score was significantly correlated with all
   three SF biomarkers (P < 0.01). Summed synovial stroma, and all scores
   combined were significantly correlated with IL-8 and MCP-1
   concentrations (P < 0.003), and the summed synoviocyte scores were
   significantly correlated with MCP-1 concentrations (P <0.001).
   Correlations between MCP-1 concentrations and synovial histopathologic
   grading and its discriminative ability suggest its potential as a
   synovitis biomarker in canine stifle OA associated with CrCL rupture.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and estimating regional climate change under different
   anthropogenic emission scenarios is pivotal for informing societal
   adaptation and mitigation measures. However, the high computational
   complexity of state-of-the-art climate models remains a central
   bottleneck in this endeavour. Here we introduce a machine learning
   approach, which utilises a unique dataset of existing climate model
   simulations to learn relationships between short-term and long-term
   temperature responses to different climate forcing scenarios. This
   approach not only has the potential to accelerate climate change
   projections by reducing the costs of scenario computations, but also
   helps uncover early indicators of modelled long-term climate responses,
   which is of relevance to climate change detection, predictability, and
   attribution. Our results highlight challenges and opportunities for
   data-driven climate modelling, especially concerning the incorporation
   of even larger model datasets in the future. We therefore encourage
   extensive data sharing among research institutes to build ever more
   powerful climate response emulators, and thus to enable faster climate
   change projections.}},

Abstract = {{Background Atypical glandular cells (AGC) as a diagnostic category in
   cervicovaginal cytology remains as a challenge to cytopathologists.
   Aims The aim of the present study is to identify the cytological
   features helpful in categorizing AGC as reactive or neoplastic upon
   correlation with histology.
   Materials and Methods The study was a retrospective review of cervical
   smears, with histopathological follow up, reported as glandular lesions
   for a period of 9 years. The architectural and nuclear features studied
   were adapted from The Bethesda System (TBS) to stratify the lesions as
   AGC, AGC-FN (atypical glandular cells favour neoplasia) and
   adenocarcinoma. The cytological categories were correlated with
   histology.
   Results A total of 89 cases of which 67 (AGC NOS = 34, AGC FN = 19,
   adenocarcinoma = 14) with histology were reviewed. Neoplastic lesions
   were encountered in 14 cases (34.6\%). Of the cases diagnosed as
   AGC-NOS, AGC-FN and adenocarcinoma, 26.5\%, 68.4\% and 100\%
   respectively were neoplastic on histopathology. Squamous lesions
   accounted for 14.9\% of all the glandular lesions. Rosette or acinar
   formation and loss of polarity frequently observed in neoplastic lesions
   as compared to reactive changes (p = 0.0004, p = 0.001). Of the nuclear
   features, nuclear hyperchromasia or coarse clumping of chromatin along
   with nuclear membrane irregularity and nuclear pleomorphism was
   frequently associated with neoplastic lesions as compared to reactive
   conditions (p = 0.007, p = 0.001, p = 0.0002).
   Conclusion A diagnosis of AGC at cytology harbors significant number of
   malignant lesions when confirmed on biopsy. Architectural features
   complemented with nuclear characteristics helps in differentiating
   between reactive and neoplastic conditions. Hence stratifying glandular
   lesions at cytology according to TBS helps in the management.}},

Title = {{Measuring student satisfaction as the first assessment of the Program of
   Combined Studies in Medicine, an MD/PhD-like program of the Faculty of
   Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico}},

Abstract = {{Background The Program of Combined Studies in Medicine (PECEM, by its
   acronym in Spanish) is a program for simultaneous bachelor and doctorate
   studies (MD/PhD) that enrolls students who show academic excellence and
   interest in scientific research. The initial doctoral training comprises
   seven six-month research stays in different laboratories or clinical or
   computer areas with different high-quality scientific advisors who
   provide students with a unique experience for their scientific training.
   Therefore, satisfaction in this stage is decisive for students'
   performance and physical and psychological health. The aim of the
   present study was to administer a questionnaire to measure students'
   satisfaction with their research experience as a service-product bundle.
   Methods Students answered an online questionnaire that evaluated three
   dimensions: perceived quality of the advisor, skills development, and
   infrastructure and support. Several satisfiers were also evaluated:
   recommendation of the advisor to peers, fulfillment of student
   expectations and satisfaction with the program. Correlations were
   calculated using Fisher's exact test. The significance was set at p <
   0.05. Results The high quality of the advisor, skills development and
   guidance during the stay were satisfiers correlated to the students'
   recommendation of their advisors to their peers and to the fulfillment
   of the students' scientific expectations. Conversely, skills development
   and infrastructure and support were satisfiers for a good to excellent
   experience as a PECEM student. A lack of direct interaction with the
   advisor's workgroup was related to dissatisfaction. Conclusions The
   nontangible products of the service, such as a positive interaction
   between the student, the advisor and the advisor's workgroup as well as
   support obtained during the research stay, were satisfiers. These data
   indicate that promoting a fruitful bond between the student and advisor
   is a priority to ensure the quality of our innovative MD/PhD program.}},

Journal = {{TETRAHEDRON LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{47}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{An array of arylnitro compounds with various functionality were treated
   with freshly-prepared aluminum amalgam in THE/water solution and
   resulted in the corresponding arylamines. The Al(Hg)-mediated reductions
   are relatively rapid with consumption of the amalgam and disappearance
   of starting material occurring over 20-30 min. The workup of the
   reductions involves only removal of the insoluble by-products by
   filtration followed by concentration. Only in some cases is
   chromatography required to secure the pure product. The desired
   arylamines are furnished in quantities of 25-100 mg, which in some
   cases, could be taken on to the next reaction without further
   purification. Reductions of 4-nitrobenzyl derivatives of carbohydrates
   or nucleosides were selective in affording the corresponding
   4-aminobenzyl products. To show applicability in click chemistry,
   selected aminobenzyl products are directly azidated to yield products
   that were then used in click reactions to afford the corresponding

Abstract = {{This work aims to study the bio-oils obtained from the catalytic
   co-pyrolysis of waste polymers and a residual biomass (grape seeds, GS).
   For that purpose, the organic liquid fractions produced in an auger
   reactor were thoroughly characterized in two steps, obtaining in the
   first place their main physicochemical properties as well as their
   chemical compositions, and second, their droplet combustion behaviors.
   Both the polymer type (waste tires or polystyrene, WT and PS,
   respectively) and the nature of the low-cost, calcium-based catalyst
   used (Carmeuse limestone, calcined dolomite, or an inert material such
   as sand) were studied. A significant improvement in the physicochemical
   properties of the bio-oils was obtained when using a catalyst, with
   lower viscosity, density, and oxygen content. These beneficial effects
   were more marked for the bio-oil produced with the Carmeuse catalyst,
   presumably due to the higher prevalence of aromatization and
   hydro-deoxygenation reactions. When changing the polymer source from WT
   to PS, a considerable increase in the aromatic content and a viscosity
   reduction were noted. The droplet combustion tests revealed the
   consistent occurrence of microexplosions for all of the studied
   bio-liquids, these bursting events being more violent for the GS-PS oil.
   Regarding the evaporation behavior, this liquid also yielded
   significantly higher burning rates during the initial heatup phase, in
   agreement with its richer composition in volatile compounds such as
   styrene. These results point to this fuel as the one with the best
   global combustion behavior from all of the explored bio-oils. The GS-WT
   liquids showed much closer features among them, although with noticeable
   differences depending on the catalyst used. A more volatile behavior was
   observed for GS-WT Carmeuse, followed by GS-WT dolomite and GS-WT sand,
   strengthening thus the previously reported improvements in
   physicochemical properties. Finally, the propensity to form soot of
   these bio-oils was characterized through a soot probe, which revealed a
   higher soot yield for the bio-liquids produced with the Carmeuse
   catalyst.}},

Title = {{Tunable Q wavelet transform based emotion classification in Parkinson's
   disease using Electroencephalography}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severe incurable neurological disorder. It
   is mostly characterized by non-motor symptoms like fatigue, dementia,
   anxiety, speech and communication problems, depression, and so on.
   Electroencephalography (EEG) play a key role in the detection of the
   true emotional state of a person. Various studies have been proposed for
   the detection of emotional impairment in PD using filtering, Fourier
   transforms, wavelet transforms, and non-linear methods. However, these
   methods require a selection of basis and are confined in terms of
   accuracy. In this paper, tunable Q wavelet transform (TQWT) is proposed
   for the classification of emotions in PD and normal controls (NC). EEG
   signals of six emotional states namely happiness, sadness, fear, anger,
   surprise, and disgust are studied. Power, entropy, and statistical
   moments based features are elicited from the highpass and lowpass
   sub-bands of TQWT. Six features selected by statistical analysis are
   classified with a k-nearest neighbor, probabilistic neural network,
   random forest, decision tree, and extreme learning machine. Three
   performance measures are obtained, maximum mean accuracy, sensitivity,
   and specificity of 96.16\%, 97.59\%, and 88.51\% for NC and 93.88\%,
   96.33\%, and 81.67\% for PD are achieved with a probabilistic neural
   network. The proposed method proved to be very effective such that it
   classifies emotions in PD and could be used as a potential tool for
   diagnosing emotional impairment in hospitals.}},

   Conscious Awareness, Sensory Discrimination, and Executive Function}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Conditioning is a key mechanism of placebo and nocebo
   effects in adults. Little is known about the underlying mechanisms of
   placebo and nocebo effects in youth and how they might be influenced by
   conscious awareness and cognitive abilities. In this study, the role of
   conditioning on thermal perception in youth was investigated.
   Methods: Differences in thermal ratings were assessed in response to
   consciously and non-consciously perceived cues that were conditioned to
   either low or high heat. Furthermore, we tested whether executive
   function mediates the effect of conditioning on thermal perception.
   Thirty-five high-school students (14-17 years) completed an executive
   function task and underwent a sensory perception paradigm. In a
   conditioning phase, two distinct neutral faces (conditioned cues) were
   coupled to either a low or a high temperature stimulus delivered to
   participants' forearms. In a testing phase, the conditioned cues, and
   novel faces (non-conditioned control cues), were paired with identical
   moderate thermal stimuli. In this testing phase, for half of the
   participants cues were presented consciously (supraliminally) and for
   the other half non-consciously (subliminally).
   Results: We found a significant main effect of cue type on thermal
   ratings (p = 0.003) in spite of identical heat being administered
   following all cues. Post-hoc analyses indicated that the nocebo-like
   effect (conditioned high cue compared to control) was significant (p =
   0.027); the placebo-like effect (conditioned low cue compared to
   control) was non-significant. No difference between cues presented
   supra- vs. subliminally and no significant interaction effects were
   found. The association between sensory discrimination and the magnitude
   of the nocebo-like effect was mediated by executive function.
   Conclusions: To our best knowledge, this is the first study establishing
   a relationship between thermal perception, nocebo effects, and executive
   function in youth. Our results may have important implications for
   understanding cognitive/ learning processes involved in nocebo effects.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   Built environments can affect health, but data in many geographic areas
   are limited. We used a big data source to create national indicators of
   neighborhood quality and assess their associations with health.
   Methods
   We leveraged computer vision and Google Street View images accessed from
   December 15, 2017, through July 17, 2018, to detect features of the
   built environment (presence of a crosswalk, non-single-family home,
   single-lane roads, and visible utility wires) for 2916 US counties. We
   used multivariate linear regression models to determine associations
   between features of the built environment and county-level health
   outcomes (prevalence of adult obesity, prevalence of diabetes, physical
   inactivity, frequent physical and mental distress, poor or fair
   self-rated health, and premature death {[}in years of potential life
   lost]).
   Results
   Compared with counties with the least number of crosswalks, counties
   with the most crosswalks were associated with decreases of 1.3\%, 2.7\%,
   and 1.3\% of adult obesity, physical inactivity, and fair or poor
   self-rated health, respectively, and 477 fewer years of potential life
   lost before age 75 (per 100 000 population). The presence of
   non-single-family homes was associated with lower levels of all health
   outcomes except for premature death. The presence of single-lane roads
   was associated with an increase in physical inactivity, frequent
   physical distress, and fair or poor self-rated health. Visible utility
   wires were associated with increases in adult obesity, diabetes,
   physical and mental distress, and fair or poor self-rated health.
   Conclusions
   The use of computer vision and big data image sources makes possible
   national studies of the built environment's effects on health, producing
   data and results that may inform national and local decision-making.}},

Title = {{Extraordinary Carbon Fluxes on the Shallow Pacific Arctic Shelf During a
   Remarkably Warm and Low Sea Ice Period}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{The shallow Pacific Arctic shelf has historically acted as an effective
   carbon sink, characterized by tight benthic pelagic coupling. However,
   the strength of the biological carbon pump in the Arctic has been
   predicted to weaken with climate change due to increased duration of the
   open-water period for primary production, enhanced nutrient limitation,
   and increased pelagic heterotrophy. In order to gain insights into how
   the biological carbon pump is functioning under the recent conditions of
   extreme warming and sea ice loss on the Pacific Arctic shelf, we
   measured sinking particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes with drifting
   and moored sediment traps, as well as rates of primary production and
   particle-associated microbial respiration during June 2018. In Bering
   Shelf/Anadyr Water masses, sinking POC fluxes ranged from 0.8 to 2.3 g C
   m(-2) day(-1), making them among the highest fluxes ever documented in
   the global oceans. Furthermore, high export ratios averaging 82\% and
   low rates of particle-associated microbial respiration also indicated
   negligible recycling of sinking POC in the water column. These results
   highlight the extraordinary strength of the biological carbon pump on
   the Pacific Arctic shelf during an unusually warm and low-sea ice year.
   While additional measurements and time are needed to confirm the
   ultimate trajectory of these fluxes in response to ongoing climate
   change, these results do not support the prevailing hypothesis that the
   strength of the biological carbon pump in the Pacific Arctic will weaken
   under these conditions.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{3-19}},

Abstract = {{The IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless local area networking (WLAN),
   commercially known as Wi-Fi, has become a necessity in our day-to-day
   life. Over a billion Wi-Fi access points connect close to hundred
   billion of IoT devices, smart phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, smart
   TVs, video cameras, monitors, printers, and other consumer devices to
   the Internet to enable millions of applications to reach everyone,
   everywhere. The evolution of Wi-Fi technology also resulted in the first
   commercial piloting of spread spectrum, high speed optical
   communications, OFDM, MIMO and mmWave pulse transmission technologies,
   which then became more broadly adopted by cellular phone and wireless
   sensor networking industries. The popularity and widespread Wi-Fi
   deployment in indoor areas further motivated innovation in opportunistic
   cyberspace applications that exploit the ubiquitous Wi-Fi signals. The
   RF signal radiated from Wi-Fi access points creates an ``RF cloud{''}
   accessible to any Wi-Fi equipped device hosting or supporting these
   opportunistic applications. Wi-Fi positioning and location intelligence
   were the first popular opportunistic applications of Wi-Fi's RF cloud.
   Today, researchers are investigating opportunistic applications of Wi-Fi
   signals for gesture and motion detection as well as authentication and
   security. This paper provides a holistic overview of the evolution of
   Wi-Fi technology and its applications as the authors experienced it in
   the last few decades.}},

Title = {{Formal accountability, perceived accountability and aggressive reporting
   judgements}},
Journal = {{ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{We extend the literature on accountability in an experimental setting to
   examine the influence of formal accountability, individual-level
   perceived accountability and their interactions on accountants'
   aggressive judgements in China. Individual-level perceived
   accountability is based on the phenomenological perspective, which
   recognises that its intrinsic nature is derived from multiple sources
   known as the `web of accountabilities' in socialisation processes.
   Researchers suggest that perceived accountability is fidelity to
   `personal conscience' in individuals' moral values and their internal
   sense of moral obligations. Our findings show that when formal
   accountability was imposed, accountants were not aggressive in making
   their reporting judgements, irrespective of their scores on perceived
   accountability measures. In contrast, when formal accountability was not
   imposed, accountants who scored higher (lower) on perceived
   accountability measures were less (more) aggressive in making reporting
   judgements. Our results further show that imposition of formal
   accountability is not equally important in influencing the judgements of
   accountants who scored higher on perceived accountability measures and
   those who scored lower on those measures. Our findings have implications
   for determining which accountability frameworks could be developed to
   assist global standard setters, national regulators and organisations,
   including accounting firms, constrain aggressive financial reporting so
   as to improve financial reporting quality.}},

Title = {{Magnitude and Risk Factors for Interpersonal Violence Experienced by
   Canadian Teenagers in the Sport Context}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPORT \& SOCIAL ISSUES}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies demonstrate that interpersonal violence toward athletes
   (VTA) is a significant problem in some countries. However, in Canada,
   little scientific evidence on the prevalence of this issue exists. The
   objective of this study was to describe the magnitude of interpersonal
   violence toward young Canadian athletes in the context of sport and to
   explore associated risk factors. A total of 1,055 athletes, aged between
   14 and 17 years, anonymously completed an online survey about their
   experiences of various types of interpersonal violence in sport. The
   sample consisted of 763 girls and 292 boys, with a mean age of 15.3 +/-
   1.1 years. Results showed that 79.2\% of athletes reported at least one
   experience of psychological violence followed by 39.9\% reporting
   physical violence, 35.7\% reporting neglect, and 28.2\% sexual violence.
   Being older, being a girl, having specialized in a sport early on, and a
   high number of hours of weekly practice were related to higher odds of
   reporting psychological violence or neglect. Being older, being a boy,
   reporting a nonheterosexual sexual preference, greater number of hours
   of weekly practice, being in an interregional or provincial sport level,
   and practicing only team sports were related to higher odds of reporting
   physical violence. Reporting a nonheterosexual sexual preference and
   being in an interregional or international sport level were associated
   with higher odds of reporting sexual violence. In conclusion, this study
   shows that VTA, particularly psychological violence and neglect, is a
   serious problem in youth sport in Canada. These results may help to
   influence public decision makers to intervene and develop and implement
   strategies to prevent VTA.}},

   This exclusively masculine power is at once political and religious, it

   schismatic groups and quickly gives a certain place, unfortunately
   difficult to evaluate, to collegiality. According to the written

   halqa, determinant for the future of the Iba?i Maghreb, and have left a
   strong imprint that survives until today in the sacred geography of the

   commercially available technologies and materials to create a
   nature-inspired relaxation space. Frontline healthcare workers were
   invited to book 15-min experiences in the Recharge Room before, during
   or after their shifts, where they were exposed to the immersive,
   multisensory experience 496 Recharge Room users (out of a total of 562)
   completed a short survey about their experience during an unselected,
   consecutive 14-day period. Average self-reported stress levels prior to
   entering the Recharge Room were 4.58/6 (+/- 1.1). After a single 15-min
   experience in the Recharge Room, the average user-reported stress level
   was significantly reduced 1.85/6 (+/- 1.2; p < 0.001; paired t-test).
   Net Promoter Score for the experience was 99.3\%. Recharge Rooms such as
   those described here produce significant short-term reductions in
   perceived stress, and users find them highly enjoyable. These rooms may
   be of general utility in high-stress healthcare environments.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial cellulose produced from soybean oil refinery effluent is a
   good immobilization carrier because of the large pores in its fiber
   network, its high water-holding capacity, and its good biocompatibility.
   In this study, it was applied to immobilization of oleaginous yeasts for
   treating soybean oil refinery effluent. The immobilization percentage
   reached 50\%, and the removal of chemical oxygen demand and oil content
   reached 92.1\% and 93.1\%, respectively, during dynamic immobilization
   using a mass percentage of bacterial cellulose of 30\% and an
   immobilization time of 24 h, which were significantly higher than those
   of free oleaginous yeasts or yeasts immobilized by bacterial cellulose
   from rich medium. The immobilized oleaginous yeasts facilitated the
   recovery of the yeasts and effectively treated three batches of soybean
   oil refinery effluent. The immobilized oleaginous yeasts recovered after
   soybean oil refinery effluent treatment were pyrolyzed to produce
   bio-oil, which contributed to more alkanes and a higher calorific value
   of bio-oil in the pyrolysis products as compared to those of free
   oleaginous yeasts. As bacterial cellulose used as an oleaginous yeast
   cell carrier is produced from soybean oil refinery effluent, no waste of
   immobilization materials is involved and an efficient waste-into-oil
   bioprocess is developed.}},

Abstract = {{Oxy-combustion and oxygen-enriched combustion appear as promising
   options for CO2 capture. In this study, the effect of the recycled flue
   gas (RFG) ratio on lignite oxy-combustion has been experimentally
   studied in comparison with oxygen-enriched (O-2/N-2) combustion in a 30
   kW h circulating fluidized bed reactor. Oxygen concentrations range from
   21 to 28\% for both cases, while RFG ratios vary between 0.72 and 0.63
   in the oxy-combustion case. The influence of oxygen concentration in the
   combustion atmosphere on temperature, gaseous emissions, and
   carbon-based combustion efficiency were investigated by keeping the
   excess oxygen ratio constant at 1.45 for all cases. Temperatures in the
   combustor increase with increasing O-2 concentration. CO2 emissions are
   much higher in O-2/RFG combustion. CO and N2O emissions decrease with
   O-2 enrichment, while NO and SO2 emissions are promoted for both modes.
   Under O-2/RFG mode, CO, NO, N2O, and SO2 mass concentrations (mg/MJ) are
   lower compared to O-2/N-2 mode. Higher oxygen concentrations increase
   combustion efficiencies for both cases. Similar O-2 concentrations
   result in similar combustion efficiencies. Oxy-combustion results are
   considered as the most favorable option for CO2 capture along with the
   competitive combustion efficiencies and less emissions per unit energy.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle-aided combination chemotherapy offers several advantages
   like ratiometric drug delivery, dose reduction, multi-targeted therapy,
   synergism, and overcoming multi-drug resistance. The current research
   was instigated to facilitate targeted and ratiometric co-delivery of
   docetaxel (DT) and curcumin (CR) through the development of folate
   (FA)-appended nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), i.e., FA-DTCR-NLCs
   to lung cancer cells. The FA-DTCR-NLCs were formulated by employing a
   scaleable and solvent-free high-pressure homogenization approach. The
   FA-DTCR-NLCs were evaluated for in vitro and in vivo characteristics
   using suitable analytical and statistical techniques. The FA-DTCR-NLCs
   demonstrated physicochemical properties and particokinetics suitable for
   targeted, ratiometric co-delivery of the anticancer agents. This was
   further affirmed by significantly better in vivo relative
   bioavailability of DT (24.85 fold) with FA-DTCR-NLCs as compared with
   Taxotere(R) (p < 0.05) and cell line studies. A significant tumor
   regression was observed from the results of tumor staging in a murine
   model of lung carcinoma (p < 0.05). Immunostaining of the tumor sections
   with tumor differentiation biomarkers suggested considerably higher
   apoptotic, anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic, and anti-metastatic
   potential of FA-DTCR-NLCs compared with Taxotere(R). In vivo toxicity
   assessment of the FA-DTCR-NLCs demonstrated a noteworthy reduction in DT
   associated side effects. The in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical findings
   prove the therapeutic and safety pre-eminence of FA-DTCR-NLCs for the
   treatment of NSCLC.}},

   Human GABA(A) Receptors Containing gamma 1, gamma 2, and gamma 3
   Subunits}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{gamma-Aminobutyric-acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors expressing the gamma
   1 or gamma 3 subunit are only found within a few regions of the brain,
   some of which are involved in sleep. No known compounds have been
   reported to selectively target gamma 1- or gamma 3-containing GABA(A)
   receptors. Pharmacological assessments of this are conflicting, possibly
   due to differences in experimental models, conditions, and exact
   protocols when reporting efficacies and potencies. In this study, we
   evaluated the modulatory properties of five non-benzodiazepine Z-drugs
   (zaleplon, indiplon, eszopiclone, zolpidem, and alpidem) used in sleep
   management and the benzodiazepine, diazepam on human alpha 1 beta 2
   gamma receptors using all three gamma subtypes. This was accomplished
   using concatenated GABA(A) pentamers expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes
   and measured via two-electrode voltage clamp. This approach removes the
   potential for single subunits to form erroneous receptors that could
   contribute to the pharmacological assessment of these compounds. No
   compound tested had significant effects on gamma 1-containing receptors
   below 10 mu M. Interestingly, zaleplon and indiplon were found to
   modulate gamma 3-containing receptors equally as efficacious as gamma
   2-containing receptors. Furthermore, zaleplon had a higher potency for
   gamma 3- than for gamma 2-containing receptors, indicating certain
   therapeutic effects could occur via these gamma 3-containing receptors.
   Eszopiclone modulated gamma 3-containing receptors with reduced efficacy
   but no reduction in potency. These data demonstrate that the
   imidazopyridines zaleplon and indiplon are well suited to further
   investigate potential gamma 3 effects on sleep in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To evaluate the effectiveness of a 12-month multifactorial
   intervention by primary care nurses using health assets in increasing
   adherence to physical activity prescription (150 min/week) in patients
   with two or more cardiovascular risk factors.
   Background Physical activity promotion is a priority and helps to
   decrease mortality risk due to cardiovascular diseases. However,
   adherence to the habitual physical activity prescription in primary
   healthcare settings is low.
   Design Multicentre, single-blind, parallel randomized (in two different
   branches) clinical trial.
   Methods In total, 263 participants from 20 primary healthcare centres in
   Mallorca completed the randomized controlled trial study (intervention
   group N = 128, control group N = 135). The intervention consisted in
   four visits and included a motivational interview and an individualized
   prescription of physical activity using health assets. Primary outcome
   measure was the number of participants performing at least 150 min of
   weekly physical activity. Secondary outcomes included physical activity
   level and physical fitness, Sense of Coherence, cardiovascular risk,
   sociodemographic data, trans-theoretical stage of change, sleep quality,
   and depression.
   Results Adherence to the recommendation of at least 150 min of physical
   activity was higher in the intervention than in the control group
   (chi(2) = 3.951, p = .047). However, this higher adherence did not
   suppose higher physical activity levels because no differences between
   groups were found in the total physical activity performed after
   intervention (t=-0.915, p = .361). At the end of the intervention
   participants randomized to the intervention group spent more time
   walking than participants in the control group (t = 2.260, p = .025).
   Conclusion The multifactorial intervention performed by primary care
   nurses induced a higher adherence to the 150-min of weekly physical
   activity recommendation.
   Impact Adherence to the usual physical activity prescription in primary
   care is low. Physical activity prescription performed by primary care
   nurses and based on health assets and motivational interview can help to
   increase physical activity levels of patients. The main finding of the
   present study was that prescription using this approach was shown to be
   effective, leading to a higher adherence in the intervention group. This
   intervention is feasible in the nurse's primary healthcare setting, thus
   it could be implemented as the main tool when exercise is prescribed.

Abstract = {{Purpose Our study aimed to explore the programmed death 1 (PD-1)
   expression on tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) in T cell non-Hodgkin
   lymphoma (T-NHL) and its relationship with lymphoma prognosis. The
   effect of PD-1 expression on the function of macrophages was also
   studied. Methods Multispectral image quantitative analysis was applied
   for detecting PD-1 expression on macrophages in T cell lymphoma tissues.
   The Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to evaluate the value of PD-1
   expression of TAM in predicting the overall survival of T-NHL. PD-1
   overexpression THP-1-derived macrophage was constructed and was
   cocultured with Jurkat cells to explore the effect of PD-1 on macrophage
   function. Results In 17 T cell lymphoma cases, the 1-year overall
   survival rate was significantly lower in patients with higher PD-1
   expression on TAMs (0.25 vs 0.86, p < 0.05). After co-cultured with
   Jurkat cells, classically activated (M1)-related markers on PD-1
   overexpressed macrophages were significantly lower than those on
   controls, while the expressions of alternatively activated (M2) related
   markers were similar. The PD-1 overexpressed macrophages showed
   inhibited phagocytosis (4.42\% vs 40.7\%, p < 0.001) and increased IL-10
   secretion (144.48 pg/ml vs 32.32 pg/ml, p < 0.001). Conclusion High PD-1
   expression on TAMs in T-NHL may predict poor prognosis. The PD-1
   overexpression of macrophages significantly inhibited polarization of M1
   macrophages and phagocytosis, and more IL-10 was excreted. These changes
   may enhance the pro-tumor effects of tumor microenvironment.}},

Abstract = {{Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a devastating complication of
   systemic JIA (sJIA), seen in approximately 10-25\% of the sJIA patients.
   A number of criteria have been proposed to differentiate between
   activation of sJIA and MAS, including HScore and the recently proposed
   MS-score. This is the first study comparing the performances of MS-score
   and HScore for the diagnosis of MAS in sJIA patients. Systemic JIA
   patients followed at Hacettepe University Pediatric Rheumatology Unit
   were included in the study. Clinical features and laboratory findings at
   the time when the disease was most active or patients were diagnosed
   with MAS were recorded retrospectively. HScore and MS-score were
   calculated and the diagnostic performance for MAS was compared by
   receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Seventy-one sJIA
   patients were included (23 MAS, 48 activation). There was no difference
   in age of onset (median 4.7 vs. 5.0 years) and gender (73.9\% vs.
   54.2\%) between patients who had MAS and sJIA activation. Median
   MS-score and HScore were higher in the MAS group. ROC curve analysis
   revealed that the HScore performed slightly better in diagnosing MAS,
   compared with the MS-score (AUC = 0.965 and 0.901 for HScore and
   MS-score respectively, P < 0.001). In our cohort, the optimal cut-off
   for the MS score was >= - 1.64 (sensitivity: 91.3\%; specificity:
   83.8\%) and for the HScore it was >= 162.5 (sensitivity: 91.3\%;
   specificity: 90.2\%). HScore performed slightly better than MS-score for
   the diagnosis of MAS in our cohort.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an approach for the optimal operation of electrified
   railways by balancing energy flows among energy exchange with the
   traditional electrical grid, energy consumption by accelerating trains,
   energy production from decelerating trains, energy from renewable energy
   resources (RERs) such as wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) energy
   systems, and energy storage systems. The objective function considered
   in this work is the minimization of total operating cost of electrified
   railway system consisting of cost of power generation from the external
   power system, cost of power obtained from RERs such as wind and solar PV
   sources, cost of power from storage systems such as battery storage and
   supercapacitors, and the income obtained by selling excess power back to
   the main electrical grid. This problem is formulated as an AC optimal
   power flow problem subjected to various equality and inequality
   constraints. In this work, the probability distribution functions (PDFs)
   are used to the uncertainties related to wind and solar PV powers. The
   proposed optimization problem is solved by using CONOPT solver of
   generalized algebraic modeling system (GAMS) software, which is a
   powerful and efficient optimization tool. The simulation results
   obtained with GAMS/CONOPT solver are also compared with meta-heuristic
   based differential evolution algorithm (DEA).}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Active and passive exposure to tobacco cigarettes during
   pregnancy is associated with multiple negative health outcomes for the
   fetus. In addition, exposure to e-cigarettes has been progressively
   discussed as a new threat to fetal health. Until now, there has been a
   lack of studies examining active and passive exposure to tobacco and
   e-cigarettes among pregnant women. The objective of our current STudy on
   E-cigarettes and Pregnancy (STEP) was to advance and complement the
   current knowledge regarding active and passive exposure to tobacco and
   e-cigarettes before pregnancy and during early and late pregnancy.
   Methods One element of the STEP study was a quantitative cross-sectional
   design: A sample of 540 pregnant women recruited at an obstetrician
   clinic in Hamburg from April 2018 to January 2019 were surveyed once via
   a standardized questionnaire and provided complete information regarding
   their consumption of tobacco and e-cigarettes. We performed a
   descriptive analysis of tobacco and e-cigarette use before pregnancy and
   during early and late pregnancy, as well as bivariate analysis of these
   variables with sociodemographic determinants. Passive exposure was
   assessed by asking the participating pregnant women about the
   consumption of tobacco and e-cigarettes by their partners, in general,
   and in their homes. Results Before pregnancy, 20.0\% of the participants
   used tobacco cigarettes exclusively, 1.3\% used e-cigarettes
   exclusively, and 6.5\% were dual users. Educational level was
   significantly associated with tobacco cigarette use (p < 0.001) and dual
   use (p = 0.047) before pregnancy. During early (late) pregnancy, 8.7\%
   (2.8\%) used tobacco cigarettes and 0.4\% (0.0\%) used e-cigarettes
   exclusively. Twenty-point nine percent of women's partners consumed
   tobacco cigarettes exclusively, 2.7\% consumed e-cigarettes exclusively,
   and 2.7\% consumed both. A total of 8.5\% (16.7\%) of the partners who
   consumed tobacco cigarettes exclusively (e-cigarettes exclusively) did
   so in the women's homes. Conclusions for Practice Among pregnant women,
   the use of tobacco cigarettes remains prominent before and during
   pregnancy, while e-cigarette use predominately occurs before pregnancy.
   Our study shows that pregnant women are frequently exposed to their
   partners' tobacco and e-cigarette use within their homes. Strategies to
   reduce such exposure should be further intensified.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a new material containing Chitosan (Ch)-Vermiculite (V)
   composite beads was synthesized with epichlorohydrin cross-linking agent
   and used to remove uranyl ions from the aqueous solution. The prepared
   new material was characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR analyses and PZC
   measurement. The effects of significant parameters on adsorption
   including temperature, pH, concentration and time were investigated. The
   obtained results indicated that the new composites of Ch-V was revealed
   in different structure. The zeta potential analyses showed that
   electrostatic attraction existed during the adsorption process between
   the uranyl ions and Ch-V. The maximum adsorption capacity of material
   was calculated as 0.665 mol kg(-1) by considering Langmuir equation.
   Adsorption kinetic was also explained with pseudo second order and intra
   particular diffusion models. Experimental studies clearly showed that
   the adsorption was endothermic and occurred spontaneously. The newly
   developed smart material has many advantages such as reusability, high
   adsorption capacity, selectivity and economics.}},

Abstract = {{Nonreef habitats such as mangroves, seagrass, and macroalgal beds are
   important for foraging, spawning, and as nursery habitat for some coral
   reef fishes. The spatial configuration of nonreef habitats adjacent to
   coral reefs can therefore have a substantial influence on the
   distribution and composition of reef fish. We investigate how different
   habitats in a tropical seascape in the Philippines influence the
   presence, density, and biomass of coral reef fishes to understand the
   relative importance of different habitats across various spatial scales.
   A detailed seascape map generated from satellite imagery was combined
   with field surveys of fish and benthic habitat on coral reefs. We then
   compared the relative importance of local reef (within coral reef) and
   adjacent habitat (habitats in the surrounding seascape) variables for
   coral reef fishes. Overall, adjacent habitat variables were as important
   as local reef variables in explaining reef fish density and biomass,
   despite being fewer in number in final models. For adult and juvenile
   wrasses (Labridae), and juveniles of some parrotfish taxa (Chlorurus),
   adjacent habitat was more important in explaining fish density and
   biomass. Notably, wrasses were positively influenced by the amount of
   sand and macroalgae in the adjacent seascape. Adjacent habitat metrics
   with the highest relative importance were sand (positive), macroalgae
   (positive), and mangrove habitats (negative), and fish responses to
   these metrics were consistent across fish groups evaluated. The 500-m
   spatial scale was selected most often in models for seascape variables.
   Local coral reef variables with the greatest importance were percent
   cover of live coral (positive), sand (negative), and macroalgae (mixed).
   Incorporating spatial metrics that describe the surrounding seascape
   will capture more holistic patterns of fish-habitat relationships on
   reefs. This is important in regions where protection of reef fish
   habitat is an integral part of fisheries management but where protection
   of nonreef habitats is often overlooked.}},

Abstract = {{We show that when a drop of water is maintained in its Leidenfrost
   regime, a sound in the form of periodic beats emits from the drop. The
   process of beat emission involves two distinct frequencies. One
   component is the frequency of beats itself, and the second is the
   frequency of sound in every beat which is emitted when one oscillation
   in the drop occurs. Experiments were performed by placing a drop of
   water over a concave metallic surface, and the beats of the drop were
   recorded by fixing a microphone above the drop. A video camera was also
   fixed above the drop to record its oscillations. Simple analytical
   techniques like Fourier and wavelet transforms of the audio signals and
   image processing of the videos of the drop were used to gain insight
   into the mechanism of the beat emission process. This analysis also
   helped us in studying the dependence of frequencies, if any, on the
   radius of the drop and the substrate temperature.}},

Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{The field of quantum sensing aims at improving the detection and
   estimation of classical parameters that are encoded in physical systems
   by resorting to quantum sources of light and quantum detection
   strategies. The same approach can be used to improve the current
   classical measurements that are performed on biological systems. Here we
   consider the scenario of two bacteria (E. coli and Salmonella) growing
   in a Luria-Bertani broth and monitored by classical spectrophotometers.
   Their concentration can be related to the optical transmissivity via the
   Beer-Lambert-Bouguer's law and their growth curves can be described by
   means of Gompertz functions. Starting from experimental data points, we
   extrapolate the growth curves of the two bacteria and we study the
   theoretical performance that would be achieved with a quantum setup. In
   particular, we discuss how the bacterial growth can in principle be
   tracked by irradiating the samples with orders of magnitude fewer
   photons, identifying the clear superiority of quantum light in the early
   stages of growth. We then show the superiority and the limits of quantum
   resources in two basic tasks: (i) the early detection of bacterial
   growth and (ii) the early discrimination between two bacteria species.}},

   with a specific network structure. Two exemplary discrete-time mixed
   integer linear programming models following the Resource Task Network
   framework are presented. They address asset deterioration due to effects
   such as fouling by suggesting specific maintenance actions as a set of
   different countermeasures. Novel enumerator formulations are a
   computationally efficient and extendable way to model the various
   degradation types. Results show the benefit of optimal maintenance in
   the application to asset fleets. The decision-support that is delivered
   by the scheduling and planning approach helps to determine which
   maintenance type should be conducted and at what time. The paper
   demonstrates the benefits of optimal (long-term) schedules for
   maintenance, but indicate at the same time the need for efficient
   algorithms in the context of large asset fleets, in contrast to common
   industrial case studies that are rather small-scale.}},

Abstract = {{Freestanding and binder-free electrospun carbon nanofiber mats with a
   cross-linked structure (CLCF) were fabricated by using pitch as the
   precursor. The cross-linked structure can be tuned easily by controlling
   the preoxidation degree of electrospun nanofibers. This cross-linking
   strategy can not only convert low value pitch into economical efficient
   energy storage materials but also reduce contact resistance and enhance
   ion diffusion kinetics of the as-obtained CLCF by reducing the fiber
   diameter, balancing porous structure, and conductivity. The CLCF
   electrode with a moderate preoxidation degree exhibits remarkable rate
   performance (160 F g(-1) at 100 A g(-1), 85.6\% of its initial capacity
   at 1 A g(-1)) in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, compared with carbon
   nanofibers without and with an overdose of cross-linked structure.
   Moreover, as a scaffold for depositing NiMoO4, impressive
   electrochemical performance can be achieved. The assembled asymmetrical
   device based on CLCF and NiMoO4-anchored CLCF delivers a stable working
   voltage of 1.6 V with a high energy output of 14.9 Wh kg(-1) and a
   maximum power density of 14.3 kW kg(-1). The intriguing electrochemical
   performance can be credited to the cross-linked fibrous structure that
   endows the CLCF with rapid ion diffusion kinetics and fast electron
   transfer as well as robust structural stability to bear the volume
   fluctuation of NiMoO4 during the repeated charge/discharge process.
   Therefore, our work provides a new strategy to design high performance
   carbon nanofiber mats with a cross-linked structure as a dual-functional
   material for supercapacitor devices by using pitch.}},

Title = {{Open innovation knowledge management in transition to market economy:
   integrating dynamic capability and institutional theory}},
Journal = {{ECONOMICS OF INNOVATION AND NEW TECHNOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{This study provides a theoretical framework and empirical evidence to
   argue that a knowledge management process under the open innovation
   paradigm brings a viable solution for firms, especially those in
   transition economies, to acquire valuable knowledge-based dynamic
   capabilities to respond to environmental changes and achieve desirable
   organizational performance. These knowledge-based capabilities in turn
   enable firms to enhance their economic performance in terms of
   productivity and profitability. Dynamic capabilities act as an
   intermediary that bridges firms' open innovation efforts and their
   economic realization. Local institutional quality plays an important
   moderating role in this process. Micro-sized firms have not consistently
   obtained the expected economic benefits from their open innovation
   efforts, which require more policy attention. For empirical evidence, we
   consider a comprehensive range of measures for open innovation and
   dynamic capabilities. Our proposed hypotheses are tested in a set of
   seemingly unrelated equations by combining two datasets from the Vietnam
   SME survey and the Provincial Competitiveness Index survey. As a
   robustness check, we estimate the performance equation applying
   fixed-effect regression and one-year lag structure.}},

Abstract = {{Pore characteristics heavily influence the gas storage mechanisms in gas
   shales. For a deep understanding of the pore structure characteristics,
   the fractal analysis was performed through low-pressure nitrogen (N-2)
   adsorption experiments on 5 shale samples collected from Gondwana and
   Assam basins of India. The characteristics of low-pressure N-2
   adsorption isotherms revealed the mesoporous nature of the shale
   samples. It can be observed that N-2 adsorption was dominated by van der
   Waals forces until the relative pressure (P/P-o) reached approximate to
   0.45, and later, it was dominated by surface tension thereby dividing
   the adsorption curve into 2 regions at P/P-o approximate to 0.45.
   Fractal dimensions (D) were estimated using the Frenkel-Hasley-Hill
   (FHH) method in the above-mentioned 2 regions separately. The fractal
   dimensions were further correlated with the shale constituents and
   different pore characteristic parameters. Results indicate that fractal
   dimensions are positively correlated with the BET specific surface area
   (BET-SSA) and quartz content. However, fractal dimensions negatively
   correlated with the TOC, CO2 micropore volume, and average pore
   diameter. Comparison of the fractal dimensions with the shale pore
   characteristics suggested that the selected shale samples are highly
   nonhomogeneous and are dominant with complex micropores and mesopores.}},

Abstract = {{Background Paternally inherited loss-of-function mutations in MKRN3

Abstract = {{A unique feature of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is the presence of CD4(+) T
   cells that surround, protect, and promote survival of tumor cells. The
   adhesion molecules involved in this so-called T-cell rosetting are
   important components of the immunological synapse (IS). However, it is
   unknown whether this synapse is fully assembled and leads to T-cell
   activation by enabling interaction between the T-cell receptor (TCR) and
   human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA-II). We established a novel
   rosetting model by coculturing HLA-II-matched peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells with HL cell lines and showed IS formation with
   activation of rosetting T cells. HLA-II downregulation by class II
   transactivator knockout did not affect the extent of rosetting, but
   almost completely abrogated T-cell activation. Intriguingly, the level
   of CD58 expression correlated with the extent of rosette formation, and
   CD58 knockout or CD2 blockade reduced both rosette formation and T-cell
   activation. The extension of our findings to primary HL tissue by
   immunohistochemistry and proximity ligation assays showed interaction of
   CD2 with CD58 and of TCR-associated CD4 with HLA-II. In conclusion,
   T-cell rosetting in HL is established by formation of the IS, and
   activation of rosetting T cells critically depends on the interaction of
   both TCR-HLA-II and CD2-CD58.}},

Title = {{Psychometric Properties of the Chinese SUPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale:
   Factor Structure and Measurement Invariance Across Gender and Age}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Impulsivity is widely recognized as a risk factor for a
   variety of mental disorders and problematic behaviors. The Short UPPS-P
   Impulsive Behavior Scale (SUPPS-P) is an extensively used instrument to
   measure impulsivity in research and clinical settings. The current study
   primarily aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese
   version of the SUPPS-P (C-SUPPS-P) among Chinese adolescents and
   emerging adults, and then to test its measurement invariance across
   gender and age.
   Methods: Data were collected from three vocational high schools and six
   colleges in Changsha, China. A total of 2,551 participants (20.1\% male
   and 22.6\% adolescents) completed the C-SUPPS-P and scales assessing
   addictive and problematic smartphone use, as well as emotional symptoms
   (anxiety, stress, depression). Four alternative models were examined and
   compared by using confirmatory factor analysis to determine the best
   factor structure of the C-SUPPS-P. Multigroup confirmatory factor
   analyses were used to test measurement invariance across gender and age.
   Results: A theory-driven five-factor structure consistent with the
   original scale was identified. All of the subscales had good internal
   consistency. The correlations observed with the other scales supported
   the construct validity of the C-SUPPS-P. Full measurement invariance was
   established across gender and age, and significant gender and age
   differences according to impulsivity facets were identified.
   Conclusions: The C-SUPPS-P presents a consistent factor structure, as
   well as reliability and validity that are equivalent to those of the
   original scale. The full measurement invariance shown across gender and
   age allows for intergroup comparisons. Overall, the C-SUPPS-P is a
   promising instrument to measure various impulsivity traits in Chinese

Title = {{Application of microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation
   (MICP) in sand embankments for scouring/erosion control}},
Journal = {{MARINE GEORESOURCES \& GEOTECHNOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Embankment is vulnerable to scouring and erosion during heavy rainfall
   events in most coastal areas in China. In this study, microbially
   induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) technique was applied for
   sand embankments for scouring/erosion control. Three small-scale MICP
   treated sand embankments and one untreated embankment were first
   prepared using the injection method. Then, a series of laboratory
   scouring/erosion experiments were performed to investigate the slope
   failure process. The total erosion mass, the soil detachment rate and
   the content of MICP induced calcium carbonate (CaCO3) were also measured
   to evaluate the effectiveness of MICP treatment in sand embankments.
   Experimental results revealed that the average CaCO3 content was
   increased by 2\% with each increment of MICP treatment cycle. The
   anti-scouring/erosion performance of MICP treated sand embankments was
   significantly improved as compared to the untreated one. Scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) technique was also used to further study the
   micro-mechanism of the MICP treatment. The results revealed that the
   MICP induced CaCO3 was formed at the contact points among sand grains
   that increased the bonding strength, resulting in an improvement of
   scouring/erosion resistance of the treated embankment. This study
   preliminarily investigates the feasibility of using the MICP technique
   to mitigate scouring/erosion of sand embankment in coastal areas. More
   complicated environmental factors need to be considered for field
   implementation in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives We hypothesized that some coronary sinus (CS) anatomies allow
   a more straightforward CS Reducer (CSR) implantation.
   Background Recent decades have seen a rise in patients with chronic
   angina. When complete revascularization and maximal medical therapy fail
   to reduce symptoms, CSR has become a new therapeutic option.
   Methods We identified a classical C-shape-a near horizontal course of
   the proximal portion of a circular CS-in a retrospective analysis of 47
   CSR implantations and compared the procedural time, fluoroscopic time,
   contrast use, presence of valves or bifurcations and procedural
   complications with the non-C-shape CS anatomy.
   Results We found a significant difference in procedural (20.0
   {[}19.0-24.7] min vs. 24.5 {[}20.7-51.0] min; p = .028 and fluoroscopic
   time (9.5 {[}7.5-14.5] min vs. 11.0 {[}7.9-30.0] min; p = .016). There
   was no significant difference in contrast use. The presence of
   bifurcations or valves along the CS course did not influence the
   procedural timings.
   Conclusion This study is the first systematic evaluation of CS anatomy
   and its procedural implications. We identified a favorable C-shape
   anatomy which allows for a more straightforward implantation. Operators
   should be aware of the different implications of CS anatomy, their
   influence on guiding catheter stability and overall procedure
   complexity.}},

   frequency, first excited-state (FES) energy, excitation energy and
   coherence time using unitary transformations and Fermi's Golden Rule. We
   find that the vibration frequency, FES energy and excitation energy are
   increasing functions of the barrier height, but are decreasing ones of
   the ASECP range; the coherence time, however, has totally opposite
   properties. Our results may be useful for the design and implementation

Abstract = {{To screen the efficient media for CO2 capture of flue gas from power
   plants, a strategy for improving the CO2 capture capacity by dual
   functionalized ionic liquids (ILs) with multiple active sites is
   proposed. Three phosphonium dual functionalized ILs ({[}aP(4443)]
   {[}2-Np], {[}aP(4443)] {[}2-Op], and {[}aP(4443)]{[}Triz]) have been
   prepared. The sorption capacities of the synthesized ILs under pure CO2
   atmosphere and the supported ILs under different loading amounts from 10
   to 50\%, temperatures of 30-80 degrees C, and CO2 partial pressure
   varied from 10 to 15\% were determined. Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR) spectroscopy was applied to reveal the interaction between CO2
   and ILs, and the pseudo-second-order model and the intraparticle
   diffusion model were used for a better understanding of the CO2
   adsorption behavior. The results showed that a high capacity up to 1.88
   mol of CO2/mol of IL for {[}aP(4443)]{[}2-Np] is achieved, and 30\%
   IL-MCM-41 can reach 3.19 mmol/g with excellent reversibility under the
   atmosphere of CO2:N-2 (159/0:85\%) at 30 degrees C and 0.1 MPa. Raising
   the temperature or decreasing the CO2 concentration is not conducive to
   improving the CO2 capacity. FTIR spectroscopy demonstrated that the
   amino and hydroxyl react with CO2 to form NHCOO- or CO3-. Combined with
   the activation energy calculation, the kinetic analysis revealed that
   the CO2 capture of supported ILs is an internal diffusion controlled
   physical adsorption.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discussed the limitation of the laser-induced incandescence
   (LII) method for the measurement of soot in different laminar pulverized
   coal flames and explored the soot formation characteristic. Multiple
   methods, including digital photography, thermophoretic sampling, elastic
   laser scattering (ELS), and LII methods, were adopted to
   laboratory-scale laminar pulverized coal flames with different coal
   types (anthracite, lignite, and bituminous coal) and coal particle sizes
   (61-90, 90-100, and 100-154 mu m). The flame structure, the morphology
   of dominant particles in different combustion regions, and the spatial
   distribution of soot and micron-sized carbonaceous particles were
   obtained and analyzed. The optical measurement and sampling results
   showed that the soot yield was so low that the LII signal from soot did
   not dominate in the detection area for anthracite, lignite, and the
   larger size fraction bituminous coal flames. In particular, a comparison
   of LII and scattering signals indicated that the vast majority of the
   LII signal was excited from char and unburned coal for anthracite flame,
   and char combustion was predominant during the combustion process.
   Moreover, the coal particles were more dispersed for the larger particle
   size fraction bituminous coal flames, which favored soot oxidation but
   did not favor local fuel-rich combustion and the formation of soot.
   Therefore, in the present study, the soot yield was high enough only in
   61-90 mu m bituminous coal flame, and the interference LII signal from
   char or unburned coal particles could be neglected by carefully
   controlling the laser fluence. It was also found that the LII signal
   intensity increased as the particle size of the pulverized coal jet
   decreased in the noncombustion case, which could be explained by the
   smaller total emission surface area with larger particle size. In
   addition, the temperature of heated coal particles was also lower as the
   coal particle size increased, which resulted in the weaker LII signal
   from coal particles. On the basis of this, a new phenomenon of primary
   fragmentation of coal particles in pulverized coal flames was observed
   for the first time by LII measurement, which could provide a potential
   method for the study of primary fragmentation for coal particles.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer cell mechanotype changes are newly recognized cancer phenotypic
   events, whereas metastatic cancer cells show decreased cell stiffness
   and increased deformability relative to normal cells. To further examine
   how cell mechanotype changes in early stages of cancer transformation
   and progression, an in vitro multi-step human urothelial cell
   carcinogenic model was used to measure cellular Young's modulus,
   deformability, and transit time using single-cell atomic force
   microscopy, microfluidic-based deformability cytometry, and quantitative
   deformability cytometry, respectively. Measurable cell mechanotype
   changes of stiffness, deformability, and cell transit time occur early
   in the transformation process. As cells progress from normal, to
   preinvasive, to invasive cells, Young's modulus of stiffness decreases
   and deformability increases gradually. These changes were confirmed in
   three-dimensional cultured microtumor masses and urine exfoliated cells
   directly from patients. Using gene screening and proteomics approaches,
   we found that the main molecular pathway implicated in cell mechanotype
   changes appears to be epithelial to mesenchymal transition.}},

Abstract = {{Double-stranded (ds)DNA formation and dissociation are of fundamental
   biological importance. The negative DNA charge influences the dsDNA
   stability. However, the base pairing and the stacking between
   neighboring bases are responsible for the sequence-dependent stability
   of dsDNA. The stability of a dsDNA molecule can be estimated from
   empirical nearest-neighbor models based on contributions assigned to
   base-pair steps along the DNA and additional parameters because of DNA
   termini. In efforts to separate contributions, it has been concluded
   that base stacking dominates dsDNA stability, whereas base pairing
   contributes negligibly. Using a different model for dsDNA formation, we
   reanalyze dsDNA stability contributions and conclude that base stacking
   contributes already at the level of separate ssDNAs but that pairing
   contributions drive the dsDNA formation. The theoretical model also
   predicts that stability contributions of base-pair steps that contain
   only guanine/cytosine, mixed steps, and steps with only adenine/thymine
   follow the order 6:5:4, respectively, as expected based on the formed
   hydrogen bonds. The model is fully consistent with the available
   stacking data and the nearest-neighbor dsDNA parameters. It allows
   assigning a narrowly distributed value for the effective free energy
   contribution per formed hydrogen bond during dsDNA formation of -0.72
   kcal.mol(-1) based entirely on the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{GeSbTe (GST) phase-change alloys feature layered crystalline structures

   light on the dependence of interlamellae interactions at the vdW gap on

   Molecular beam epitaxy is used for designing GST layers down to a single
   lamella. By combining density-functional theory and Raman spectroscopy,
   a direct and simple method is demonstrated to identify the thickness of
   the GST film. The shift of the vibrational modes is studied as a
   function of the layer size, and the low-frequency range opens up a new
   route to probe the number of lamellae for different GST compositions.
   Comparison between experimental and theoretical Raman spectra highlights
   the precision growth control obtained by the epitaxial technique.}},

Abstract = {{Background Smoking is a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease
   (AD). However, smoking-related effects on intrinsic brain activity in
   high-risk AD population are still unclear. Objective We aimed to explore
   differences in smoking effects on brain function between healthy elderly
   and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients using ReHo
   mapping. Methods We identified 64 healthy elderly controls and 116 aMCI
   patients, including 98 non-smoking and 18 smoking aMCI. Each subject
   underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI scanning and
   neuropsychological evaluations. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) mapping was
   used to assess regional brain synchronization. After correction for age,
   gender, education, and gray matter volume, we explored the difference of
   ReHo among groups in a voxel-wise way based on analysis of covariance
   (ANCOVA), followed by post hoc two-sample analyses (p < 0.05,
   corrected). Further, we correlated the mean ReHo with neuropsychological
   scales. Results Three groups were well-matched in age, gender, and
   education. Significant ReHo differences were found among three groups,
   located in the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and left angular gyrus
   (AG). Specifically, non-smoking aMCI had lower ReHo in SMG and AG than
   smoking aMCI and controls. By contrast, smoking aMCI had greater AG ReHo
   than healthy controls (p < 0.05). Across groups, correlation analyses
   showed that left AG ReHo correlated with MMSE (r = 0.18, p = 0.015),
   clock drawing test (r = 0.20, p = 0.007), immediate recall (r = 0.36, p
   < 0.001), delayed recall (r = 0.34, p < 0.001), and auditory verbal
   learning test (r = 0.20, p = 0.007). Conclusion Smoking might pose
   compensatory or protective effects on intrinsic brain activity in aMCI
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Boosting photocatalytic performance via external fields is an

   performance of existing photocatalysts. Herein, using
   alpha-Fe2O3-decorated TiO2 nanotube arrays as a model, we demonstrate
   the influence of magnetic field (MF)-direction on the photogenerated
   charge-carrier transfer behavior at plasmonic metal/semiconductor
   interfaces. For the first time, the photocatalytic activity is also
   found to correlate with the plasmonic metal species while applying an
   external MF. As verified by first-principles calculations, the
   spin-orbit coupling of metal contributes to the charge-carrier transfer.
   To highlight the anisotropic MF-tuning effect in practical applications,
   the as-prepared architecture is applied for photocatalysis-triggered
   drug delivery. The delivery rate can be remarkably accelerated by
   similar to 38\% under a tiny MF (0.4 T) with the proper direction. The
   findings in this research may provide new insight into designing

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Sweetpotato plays an important role in ensuring food security and
   household income sources for local communities in Ethiopia. It is
   dominantly grown in southern parts of Ethiopia. However, its production
   and productivity over the last few years has declined due to the limited
   access of quality planting materials at the onset of the rainy season,
   disease, and severe pest infestation. Therefore, it was imperative to
   carry out this study to identify the main constraints related to the
   recent decline in sweet in Misrak Badawacho District. The survey result
   revealed that many varieties of sweetpotato were grown in the district;
   mainly, Awassa-83, Ogan-Sagan, and Wolaita-local were the most preferred
   variety by producers. The main sweetpotato production and storage
   constraints in the study district are as follows: rodents, disease and
   insect pests, heat and drought, shortage of quality planting materials,
   and absence of best methods for long-term storage. Ogan-Sagan and
   Wolaita-local were evaluated under different storage types (straw, soil,
   ash, sawdust, and sand storage). The combination of Awassa-83 variety
   and sand storage was performed better in percentage of decay, weight
   loss, and weevil damage, whereas length and number of vine per storage
   roots were performed better in the separate treatment. Thus, Awassa-83
   variety and sand storage can be recommended for maintaining the storage
   roots during dry periods and access of quality vines at the onset of the
   rainy season. More importantly, sand storage provides an opportunity to
   maintain the quality of sweetpotato storage roots for a long period of
   time and producers can easily and timely access quality vines at the
   onset of rainy season.}},

Abstract = {{Background Severe prekallikrein deficiency (PK deficiency) is an
   autosomal-recessive condition thought to be very rare. Recently we
   reported that the previously unnoticed variant c.451dupT,
   p.Ser151Phefs{*}34 in KLKB1, which is listed in databases aggregating
   genome data, causes PK deficiency and is common in Africans according to
   gnomAD (allele frequency 1.43\%).
   Patients/Methods The most common African (c.451dupT) and European
   (c.1643G>A, p.Cys548Tyr) PK deficiency causing KLKB1 variants were
   analyzed in two population-based collectives of 300 Nigerian and 300
   German subjects. Genome databases were evaluated for variant frequencies
   and ethnicity of the subjects. The geographic origin of PK-deficient
   cases due to 451dupT was assessed.
   Results Two of five patients with PK deficiency caused by homozygous
   451dupT were African, one African American, one from Oman, and one of
   unknown origin. The frequency of 451dupT was 1.17\% in the Nigerian
   collective (7/600 alleles); none had Cys548Tyr. Subjects with 451dupT
   were found among different Nigerian ethnicities. Both variants were
   absent in the European collective. Database research was compatible with
   these findings, even though mainly data of African Americans (451dupT:
   1.12\%-1.78\%) was accessible. A relevant number of non-American
   Africans are included only in the 1000Genomes collective: 451dupT
   frequency was 1.29\% in native Africans and 1.56\% in African
   Caribbeans.
   Conclusions This study underlines the higher prevalence of PK deficiency
   among people with African descent compared to Europeans. In order to
   avoid delay of necessary surgical procedures in patients of African
   origin, diagnostic algorithms for isolated, unexplained, activated
   partial thromboplastin time prolongation in these subjects should
   include PK deficiency screening.}},

Abstract = {{Lack of quality and diversity in complementary foods adversely affect
   infant and young child's growth and nutritional status. Due to poverty,
   animal-source foods are not readily available in many rural parts of
   Nigeria. Winged termites (Macroterme bellicosus) had been reported to be
   rich in essential nutrients and could be suitable alternative to animal
   source-foods in complementary feeding when available. This study was
   designed to investigate the consumption pattern of the insect and
   acceptability of its use in complementary foods. Using a validated,
   semi-structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire, 700 respondents
   of different age groups and socio-demographic status were recruited for
   consumption study in 5 Local Government Areas of Ekiti State. Four sets
   of commonly used complementary foods (Maize and Sorghum pap, boiled rice
   and yam) were enriched with Macroterme bellicosus (MB) by adding ground
   MB to them separately in the ratio 4:1 (w/w). The macro-and
   micronutrient content of the blends were determined using standard AOAC
   methods. Maternal acceptability of the enriched foods was evaluated
   among sixty untrained nursing mothers on a seven-point hedonic scale.
   Consumption of MB was dependent on its availability during the rainy
   season; and is consumed fresh or fried with or without seasoning. Most
   (95.4\%) respondents had never experienced any negative side effect(s)
   on consumption of the insect. Addition of MB significantly improved the
   nutrient and energy content of the complementary foods. Sorghum pap
   enriched with MB had the best score in all the parameters assessed. The
   four enriched complementary foods were acceptable to the mothers, hence
   improving the nutrient content of complementary foods with Marcroterme
   bellicosus should be encouraged.}},

Title = {{Threat, Coping, and Social Distance Adherence During COVID-19:
   Cross-Continental Comparison Using an Online Cross-Sectional Survey}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Background: Social distancing is an effective preventative policy for
   COVID-19 that is enforced by governments worldwide. However, significant
   variations are observed in adherence to social distancing across
   individuals and countries. Due to the lack of treatment, rapid spread,
   and prevalence of COVID-19, panic and fear associated with the disease
   causes great stress. Subsequent effects will be a variation around the
   coping and mitigation strategies for different individuals following
   different paths to manage the situation.
   Objective: This study aims to explore how threat and coping appraisal
   processes work as mechanisms between information and citizens' adherence
   to COVID-19-related recommendations (ie, how the information sources and
   social media influence threat and coping appraisal processes with
   COVID-19 and how the threat and coping appraisal processes influence
   adherence to policy guidelines). In addition, this study aims to explore
   how citizens in three different countries (the United States, Kuwait,
   and South Korea), randomly sampled, are effectively using the
   mechanisms.
   Methods: Randomly sampled online survey data collected by a global firm
   in May 2020 from 162 citizens of the United States, 185 of Kuwait, and
   71 of South Korea were analyzed, resulting in a total sample size of
   418. A seemingly unrelated regression model, controlling for several
   counterfactuals, was used for analysis. The study's focal estimated
   effects were compared across the three countries using the weighted
   distance between the parameter estimates.
   Results: The seemingly unrelated regression model estimation results
   suggested that, overall, the intensity of information source use for the
   COVID-19 pandemic positively influenced the threat appraisal for the
   disease (P<.001). Furthermore, the intensity of social media use for the
   COVID-19 pandemic positively influenced the coping appraisal for the
   disease (P<.001). Higher COVID-19 threat appraisal had a positive effect
   on social distancing adherence (P<.001). Higher COVID-19 coping
   appraisal had a positive effect on social distancing adherence (P<.001).
   Higher intensity of COVID-19 knowledge positively influenced social
   distancing adherence (P<.001). There were country-level variations.
   Broadly, we found that the United States had better results than South
   Korea and Kuwait in leveraging the information to threat and coping
   appraisal to the adherence process, indicating that individuals in
   countries like the United States and South Korea may be more pragmatic
   to appraise the situation before making any decisions.
   Conclusions: This study's findings suggest that the mediation of threat
   and coping strategies are essential, in varying effects, to shape the
   information and social media strategies for adherence outcomes.
   Accordingly, coordinating public service announcements along with
   information source outlets such as mainstream media (eg, TV and
   newspaper) as well as social media (eg, Facebook and Twitter) to inform
   citizens and, at the same time, deliver balanced messages about the
   threat and coping appraisal is critical in implementing a staggered
   social distancing and sheltering strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Agamid lizards (Squamata: Agamidae) are karyotypically heterogeneous.
   Among the 101 species currently described from Australia, all are from
   the subfamily Amphibolurinae. This group is, with some exceptions,
   karyotypically conserved, and all species involving heterogametic sex
   show female heterogamety. Here, we describe the chromosomes of 2
   additional Australian agamid lizards, Tympanocryptis lineata and
   Rankinia diemensis. These species are phylogenetically and
   cytogenetically sisters to the well-characterised Pogona vitticeps, but
   their sex chromosomes and other chromosomal characteristics are unknown.
   In this study, we applied advanced molecular cytogenetic techniques,
   such as fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and cross-species gene
   mapping, to characterise chromosomes and to identify sex chromosomes in
   these species. Our data suggest that both species have a conserved
   karyotype with P. vitticeps but with subtle rearrangements in the
   chromosomal landscapes. We could identify that T. lineata possesses a
   female heterogametic system (ZZ/ZW) with a pair of sex microchromosomes,
   while R. diemensis may have heterogametic sex chromosomes, but this
   requires further investigations. Our study shows the pattern of
   chromosomal rearrangements between closely related species, explaining
   the speciation within Australian agamid lizards of similar karyotypes.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNO) are microwave auto-oscillators based
   on magnetic resonances having a nonlinear response with the oscillating
   amplitude, which provides them with a large frequency tunability
   including the possibility of mutual synchronization. The magnetization
   dynamics in STNO are induced by spin-transfer torque (STT) from spin
   currents and can be detected by changes in electrical resistance due to
   giant magnetoresistance or tunneling magnetoresistance. The STT effect
   is usually treated as a dampinglike term that reduces magnetic
   dissipation and promotes excitation of magnetic modes. However, an
   additional term, known as Zhang-Li term, has an effect on magnetization
   gradients such as domain walls, and could have an effect on localized
   magnetic modes in STNO. Here we study the effect of Zhang-Li torques in
   magnetic excitations produced in STNO with a nanocontact geometry. Using
   micromagnetic simulations we find that Zhang-Li torques modify threshold
   currents of magnetic modes and their effective sizes. Additionally, we
   show that effects can be controlled by changing the ratio between
   nanocontact size and layer thickness.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{In this work, ZnO nanosheets with a tunable thickness were produced by a
   microwave-assisted hydrothermal-based method. The product was well
   characterized by various tools such as XRD, SEM, EDX spectroscopy, TEM,
   and Raman spectroscopy. ZnO nanosheets were highly crystalline and
   possessed a single phase with the wurtzite structure. The ZnO nanosheets
   have a thickness ranging from 20 to 50 nm, as shown by the micrographs
   of SEM. The SAED pattern infered that the ZnO nanosheets have a single
   crystal nature with preferential growth direction along {[}0001]. ZnO
   nanosheets with E-2 (high) mode of wurtzite structure were observed by
   Raman scattering spectra. The photodegradation of methyl red using ZnO
   nanosheets was measured under UV light irradiation. In comparison with
   the commercial ZnO, ZnO nanosheets showed higher efficiency in
   photodegradation of organic dyes. The thinner the nanosheets, the higher
   their performance, which can be explained based on surface area. The
   excellent performance of ZnO nanosheets in photodegradable organic dyes
   might be important in environmental treatment and photocatalysis
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Systemic sclerosis is a chronic multisystem, autoimmune disease with
   high mortality, and to date, has no effective approved therapy. For
   patients with the most severe forms of systemic sclerosis, autologous
   hematopoietic stem cell therapy has been proven to be effective, as
   demonstrated by three randomized controlled clinical trials and at least
   two registry studies. In the controlled studies, autologous
   hematopoietic stem cell therapy was shown to improve mortality, skin
   involvement, quality-of-life, and function compared with patients
   treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide. There is significant
   transplant-related mortality associated with autologous hematopoietic
   stem cell therapy, as well as infectious and noninfectious serious
   adverse events, including cardiac and renal compromise. Although the
   results of autologous hematopoietic stem cell therapy clinical trials to
   date are highly encouraging, a number of important unanswered questions
   remain. These include the following: What is the optimal transplant
   regimen; can the spectrum of systemic sclerosis patients who respond to
   autologous hematopoietic stem cell therapy be expanded; how can disease
   relapse following autologous hematopoietic stem cell therapy be
   predicted and managed; can treatment-related toxicity and mortality be
   mitigated; can response or toxicity be predicted; and finally, is there
   a place for allogeneic stem cell transplants in systemic sclerosis?
   Systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune disease with multiple immunological,
   vascular, and fibrotic abnormalities. Immunosuppressive therapy is
   frequently used, but to date its efficacy has been generally modest.
   Stem cell transplantation is the most potent immunosuppressive therapy
   currently available, and as discussed below, may have an important role
   in the management of systemic sclerosis.}},

Title = {{Finite-N corrections to the M-brane indices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{We investigate finite-N corrections to the superconformal indices of the
   theories realized on M2- and M5-branes. For three-dimensional theories
   realized on a stack of N M2-branes we calculate the finite-N corrections
   as the contribution of extended M5-branes in the dual geometry
   AdS(4)xS(7). We take only M5-brane configurations with a single wrapping
   into account, and neglect multiple-wrapping configurations. We compare
   the results with the indices calculated from the ABJM theory, and find
   agreement up to expected errors due to the multiple wrapping. For
   six-dimensional theories on N M5-branes we calculate the indices by
   analyzing extended M2-branes in AdS(7)xS(4). Again, we include only
   configurations with single wrapping. We first compare the result for N =
   1 with the index of the free tensor multiplet to estimate the order of
   the error due to multiple wrapping. We calculate first few terms of the
   index of A(N)-1 theories explicitly, and confirm that they can be
   expanded by superconformal representations. We also discuss
   multiple-wrapping contributions to the six-dimensional Schur-like index.}},

Abstract = {{Clusterin (CLU; also known as apolipoprotein J, ApoJ) is a protein of
   inconstant structure known to be involved in diverse processes inside
   and outside of brain cells. CLU can act as a protein chaperon or protein
   solubilizer, lipid transporter as well as redox sensor and be anti- or
   proapoptotic, depending on context. Primary structure of CLU is encoded
   by CLU gene which contains single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's)
   associated with the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD).
   Studying a sample of Czech population and using the case-control
   association approach we identified C allele of the SNP rs11136000 as
   conferring a reduced risk of LOAD, more so in females than in males.
   Additionally, data from two smaller subsets of the population sample
   suggested a possible association of rs11136000 with diabetes mellitus.
   In a parallel study, we found no association between rs11136000 and mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI). Our findings on rs11136000 and LOAD
   contradict those of some previous studies done elsewhere. We discuss the
   multiple roles of CLU in a broad range of molecular mechanisms that may
   contribute to the variability of genetic studies of CLU in various
   ethnic groups. The above discordance notwithstanding, our conclusions
   support the association of rs1113600 with the risk of LOAD.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To determine if the gamma knife icon (GKI) can provide superior
   stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) dose distributions for appropriately
   selected meningioma and post-resection brain tumor bed treatments to
   volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT).
   Materials and Methods Appropriately selected targets were not proximal
   to great vessels, did not have sensitive soft tissue including
   organs-at-risk (OARs) within the planning target volume (PTV), and did
   not have concave tumors containing excessive normal brain tissue. Four
   of fourteen candidate meningioma patients and six of six candidate
   patients with brain tumor cavities were considered for this treatment
   planning comparison study. PTVs were generated for GKI and VMAT by
   adding 1 mm and 3 mm margins, respectively, to the GTVs. Identical PTV
   V-100\%-values were obtained for the GKI and VMAT plans for each
   patient. Meningioma and tumor bed prescription doses were 52.7-54.0 in
   1.7-1.8 Gy fractions and 25 Gy in 5 Gy fractions, respectively. GKI dose
   rate was 3.735 Gy/min for 16 mm collimators.
   Results PTV radical dose homogeneity index was 3.03 +/- 0.35 for GKI and
   1.27 +/- 0.19 for VMAT. Normal brain D-1\%, D-5\%, and D-10\% were lower
   for GKI than VMAT by 45.8 +/- 10.9\%, 38.9 +/- 11.5\%, and 35.4 +/-
   16.5\% respectively. All OARs considered received lower maximum doses
   for GKI than VMAT. GKI and VMAT treatment times for meningioma plans
   were 12.1 +/- 4.13 min and 6.2 +/- 0.32 min, respectively, and, for
   tumor cavities, were 18.1 +/- 5.1 min and 11.0 +/- 0.56 min,
   respectively.
   Conclusions Appropriately selected meningioma and brain tumor bed
   patients may benefit from GKI-based SRT due to the decreased normal
   brain and OAR doses relative to VMAT enabled by smaller margins. Care
   must be taken in meningioma patient selection for SRT with the GKI, even
   if they are clinically appropriate for VMAT.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Cancer survivors treated with stem-cell transplant (SCT) and
   radiation therapy are at a high risk for late effects including the
   metabolic syndrome. This study reviewed the prevalence of the metabolic
   syndrome in pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumor survivors
   treated with autologous SCT and craniospinal radiation. Methods A
   prospective, cross-sectional study in pediatric CNS tumor patients, who
   underwent a one-time evaluation at least 18 months post-autologous SCT
   for the presence of components of metabolic syndrome: obesity,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and abnormal glucose levels. Results
   Twelve patients were evaluated, and two (16\%) met full criteria for the
   metabolic syndrome. Seven patients (58\%) had at least one component of
   metabolic syndrome: elevated glucose levels in 8\% (1/12), obesity 17\%
   (2/12), hypertriglyceridemia 17\% (2/12), and reduced HDL cholesterol in
   25\% (3/12). None had hypertension. Nine patients (75\%) demonstrated
   abnormal fasting lipid profiles with elevated total cholesterol levels,
   although only 25\% (3/12) fulfilled criteria for a diagnosis of
   dyslipidemia. Conclusion Pediatric CNS tumor survivors treated with
   autologous SCT and craniospinal radiation are at risk for early signs of
   metabolic syndrome, most commonly hyperlipidemia. Further studies
   evaluating the progression of these early signs to full criteria for the
   metabolic syndrome diagnosis are required.}},

Title = {{Surface properties of chitosan/montmorillonite films for biomedical
   applications}},
Journal = {{POLYMERS \& POLYMER COMPOSITES}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we firstly investigated the surface and protein
   adsorption properties of montmorillonite (MMT)/chitosan (CS) composite
   films with various MMT/CS weight ratios for metallic implants coating
   applications. Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay results show that
   the neat CS film exhibits a high concentration of bovine serum albumin
   (BSA) protein adhesion because the abundant carbonyl and amide
   functional groups on the surface of the CS film easily form hydrogen
   bonds with the copious carboxylic acid groups on the surface of the BSA
   protein. The MMT/CS composite films with MMT/CS = 3, 5, 8, and 10
   possess a much lower BSA adhesion concentration than that of the neat CS
   film, as some of the carbonyl and amide functional groups on the surface
   of the composite films are replaced by the -Si-O-Si and -Al-O-Al groups.
   Among these MMT/CS composite films, the film with MMT/CS = 5 exhibits
   the lowest BSA adsorption concentration because it possesses a higher
   MMT content than those with MMT/CS = 1 and 3 and a smoother and
   non-porous surface than those with MMT/CS = 8 and 10. According to our
   results, MMT/CS composite films with appropriate MMT/CS weight ratios
   exhibit better surface and protein adsorption properties than neat CS
   for biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we chemically modified a phytoglycogen structure to
   introduce negative surface charge via carboxymethylation (CMPG) and then
   prepared CMPG-based ternary nanocomplex particles through electrostatic
   interactions with sodium caseinate (core) and chemical cross-linking
   with pectin (shell). The chemical cross-linking process by glutaradehyde
   was systematically optimized under various temperatures and durations.
   The cross-linked ternary nanocomplex was comprehensively characterized,
   and our results showed that it had a size of 86 nm with a spherical
   shape, smooth surface, homogeneous distribution, and negative surface
   charge. The chemical cross-linking process significantly improved
   colloidal stability of the nanocomplex under simulated gastrointestinal
   fluids with digestive enzymes. The as-prepared nanocomplex exhibited
   exceptional capability to encapsulate phloretin, a natural
   dihydrochalcone, as a model lipophilic bioactive compound. The
   nanocomplex not only showed a slow and sustained kinetic release of
   phloretin under simulated gastrointestinal fluids but also dramatically
   enhanced its antioxidant activity under an aqueous environment compared
   to pure phloretin dissolved in ethanol. Findings from this work revealed
   the promising features of the as-prepared ternary nanocomplex as a
   potential oral delivery system for lipophilic bioactive compounds.}},

Title = {{How individual metacognitive awareness relates to situation-specific
   metacognitive interpretations of collaborative learning tasks}},
Journal = {{EDUCATIONAL STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{Metacognition is a core process in human learning. The problem is that
   learners are not often aware of their metacognition. The purpose of this
   study is to examine learners' metacognitive awareness in terms of their
   situation-specific perceptions in collaborative learning tasks. Upper
   elementary school students (N = 92) filled in a Metacognitive Awareness
   Inventory (MAI) and situated self-reports that assessed their individual
   metacognitive interpretations about task difficulty and task
   understanding. Also, the students' actualised knowledge about the topics
   was assessed via knowledge tests. The results showed that students who
   have high metacognitive awareness know what they are supposed to do in
   this task and find the task easier, especially when they are exposed to
   more collaboration. Importantly, the way students perceive a task after
   the learning situation predicts their learning outcomes. The findings of
   this study can help with designing awareness tools for collaborative
   learning tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave and heat-assisted magnetic recordings are two competing
   technologies that have greatly increased the capacity of hard disk
   drives. The efficiency of the magnetic recording process can be further
   improved by employing non-collinear spin structures that combine
   perpendicular and in-plane magnetic anisotropy. Here, we investigate
   both microwave and optically excited magnetization dynamics in
   {[}Co/Pt]/NiFe exchange spring samples. The resulting canted
   magnetization within the nanoscale {[}Co/Pt]/NiFe interfacial region
   allows for optically stimulated magnetization precession to be observed
   for an extended magnetic field and frequency range. The results can be
   explained by formation of an imprinted domain structure, which locks the
   magnetization orientation and makes the structures more robust against
   external perturbations. Tuning the canted interfacial domain structure
   may provide greater control of optically excited magnetization reversal
   and optically generated spin currents, which are of paramount importance
   for future ultrafast magnetic recording and spintronic applications.}},

Title = {{A Robust Control Method for Damping and Tracking of Secondary Network
   Voltage of a PV Based Hybrid AC/DC Microgrid}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Future microgrids (MGs) will comprise of an enormous number of little
   secondary networks (SN) that will convey complex control for grid
   collaboration as well as tracking of operation. In this paper, a robust
   blended integral linear-quadratic-Gaussian (ILQG) controller is proposed
   for damping and tracking control of SN voltage of a PV based hybrid
   source of AC-DC microgrid against a number of operating conditions. The
   structure of this mixed controller is made by expanding the SN dynamics
   with the utilization of an integrator. The term SN signifies a network
   that can take power from the DC bus connected with the AC main grid and
   PV based DC grid. The aim of developing a DC bus is to provide the
   constant DC voltage in the SN load terminal which is made of a parallel
   combination of several uncertain and unknown loads that may produce the
   oscillation of its performance. The proposed blended integral
   linear-quadratic-Gaussian controller provides a large control bandwidth
   that not only reduces the oscillation but also confirms the improved
   tracking performance over the number of loads in SN premises.
   Additionally, several uncertainties are considered within the SN
   dynamics to check the robustness of the proposed blended controller. The
   evaluation of this blended controller is studied for the various load
   dynamics and compared with the linear-quadratic Gaussian (LQG),
   linear-quadratic-regulator (LQR), and integral controller (IC) in terms
   of settling time, bandwidth and tracking performances.}},

Abstract = {{The temporal dimension makes it difficult and complex to learn the
   Dynamic Bayesian Networks structure for huge search space. We propose a
   new hybrid K2-Bat algorithm to learn the structure of Dynamic Bayesian
   Networks. This work contains two optimal strategies: an ordering-based
   algorithm INOK2 to learn initial network structure and an adaptive
   binary bat algorithm to learn transition network structure. Based on the
   requirement of K2 algorithm for prior knowledge, a fitness function is
   built to quantitatively score node order in INOK2. The initial
   population is generated by the node block sequence constructed by
   directional support tree. A dynamic learning factor, inverted mutation
   s`node sequence to improve the global searching ability and the
   convergence speed. Then, the optimal initial network structure can be
   obtained. In addition, an improved binary bat algorithm is proposed to
   improve the development behavior of bat algorithm by using dynamic
   selection strategy in transitional network learning. Finally,
   experiments on four well-known benchmark problems are performed. The
   results show that the proposed algorithm can successfully learn the
   structure of Dynamic Bayesian Networks without prior knowledge, and
   balance solutions quality and computational effort.}},

   pseudosatellites (HAPS), and electric vertical take-off and landing
   (eVTOL). The battery systems' performance requirements differ across
   these applications in terms of power, cycle life, system cost, etc.
   However, the need for high gravimetric energy density, 400 Wh kg(-1) and
   beyond, is common across them all, as it enables vehicles to achieve
   extended range, a longer mission duration, lighter weight, or increased
   payload. The system-level requirements of these emerging applications
   are broken down into the component-level developments required to
   integrate Li-S technology as the power system of choice. To adapt
   batteries' properties, such as energy and power density, to the
   respective application, the academic research community has a key role
   to play in component-level development. However, materials and component
   research must be conducted within the context of a viable Li-S cell
   system. Herein, the key performance benefits, limitations, modeling, and
   recent progress of the Li-S battery technology and its adaption toward
   real-world application are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{During communication in real-life settings, the brain integrates
   information from auditory and visual modalities to form a unified
   percept of our environment. In the current magnetoencephalography (MEG)
   study, we used rapid invisible frequency tagging (RIFT) to generate
   steady-state evoked fields and investigated the integration of
   audiovisual information in a semantic context. We presented participants
   with videos of an actress uttering action verbs (auditory; tagged at 61
   Hz) accompanied by a gesture (visual; tagged at 68 Hz, using a projector
   with a 1,440 Hz refresh rate). Integration difficulty was manipulated by
   lower-order auditory factors (clear/degraded speech) and higher-order
   visual factors (congruent/incongruent gesture). We identified MEG
   spectral peaks at the individual (61/68 Hz) tagging frequencies. We
   furthermore observed a peak at the intermodulation frequency of the
   auditory and visually tagged signals (f(visual) - f(auditory) = 7 Hz),
   specifically when lower-order integration was easiest because signal
   quality was optimal. This intermodulation peak is a signature of
   nonlinear audiovisual integration, and was strongest in left inferior
   frontal gyrus and left temporal regions; areas known to be involved in
   speech-gesture integration. The enhanced power at the intermodulation
   frequency thus reflects the ease of lower-order audiovisual integration
   and demonstrates that speech-gesture information interacts in
   higher-order language areas. Furthermore, we provide a
   proof-of-principle of the use of RIFT to study the integration of
   audiovisual stimuli, in relation to, for instance, semantic context.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This paper reviews the national and institutional
   internationalization activities in Japan's higher education sector and
   considers the extent to which these efforts have attempted to
   incorporate and/or contribute to meeting the Sustainable Development
   Goals (SDGs). Design/methodology/approach This paper was developed based
   on a review of available demographic data on internationalization in
   Japan (in both English and Japanese), a survey of recent scholarly
   literature on this topic and conversations with numerous faculty and
   staff members working on internationalization issues in a wide range of
   higher education institutions throughout the country. Findings There are
   substantial internationalization efforts being made at both national and
   institutional levels, yet scholars and practitioners of higher education
   question the extent to which genuine internationalization is occurring.
   Moreover, the metrics used to track internationalization are somewhat
   limited and the available data, in many cases, can be complicated to
   interpret. A bit of tension also exists in Japanese universities between
   those who support the movement to internationalize and those who see it
   as a passing fad, an intrusion on their academic freedom and/or as a
   guise for Westernization - a tension that some cite, along with language
   barriers and system misalignment, as a challenge to
   internationalization. Originality/value Numerous scholars discuss the
   internationalization of higher education in Japan. The originality of
   this paper is in the comparison of Japan's higher education
   internationalization efforts to the movement to achieve the SDGs - both
   in Japan and as a global effort.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen, which is a new clean energy option for future energy systems
   possesses pioneering characteristics making it a desirable carbon-free
   energy carrier. Hydrogen storage plays a crucial role in initiating a
   hydrogen economy. Due to its low density, the storage of hydrogen in the
   gaseous and liquids states had several technical and economic
   challenges. Despite these traditional approaches, magnesium hydride
   (MgH2), which has high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen density,
   offers an excellent potential option for utilizing hydrogen in
   automobiles and other electrical systems. In contrast to its attractive
   properties, MgH2 should be mechanically and chemically treated to reduce
   its high activation energy and enhance its modest hydrogen
   sorption/desorption kinetics. The present study aims to investigate the
   influence of doping mechanically-treated Mg metal with 5 wt\% amorphous
   Zr2Cu abrasive nanopowders in improving its kinetics and cyclability
   behaviors. For the first time, solid-waste Mg, Zr, and Cu metals were
   utilized for preparing MgH2 and amorphous Zr2Cu alloy (catalytic agent),
   using hydrogen gas-reactive ball milling, and arc melting techniques,
   respectively. This new nanocomposite system revealed high-capacity
   hydrogen storage (6.6 wt\%) with superior kinetics and extraordinary
   long cycle-life-time (1100 h) at 250 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Background Protein energy wasting (PEW) is a common cause of morbidity
   and mortality in patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD 5).
   Intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN) has been used as a therapy for
   preventing and treating PEW in children with CKD 5 when other
   conventional modalities fail. However, not enough data is available to
   define its effectiveness in treating malnutrition in children. This
   study aims to investigate potential benefits of IDPN in Egyptian
   children with CKD 5. Methods In this prospective, placebo-controlled,
   parallel-group single blinded study, we enrolled 50 CKD 5 patients; 25
   patients (intervention group) received intravenous amino acids (KIDIMN),
   while 25 patients (control group) received normal saline as placebo,
   each given during regular dialysis 3 times a week for 9 months. Patients
   were subjected to nutritional assessment at baseline and 3-, 6-, and
   9-month follow-up using height Z-score, hand grip strength (HGS) for
   muscle power assessment, body composition monitor (BCM) for assessing
   lean tissue mass (LTM) and adipose tissue mass (ATM), and biochemical
   measures including serum albumin, serum triglyceride, and serum
   cholesterol. Results When comparing baseline and 9-month follow-up
   values, significant improvement was recorded in height Z-score, LTM, and
   serum albumin in the intervention group unlike the control group where
   no significant changes were recorded. Conclusion IDPN is proposed to be
   an effective method for preventing and treating malnutrition in children
   with CKD 5. However, further multi-centric studies with larger sample
   size and longer duration of follow-up are still recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction This study aimed to investigate whether systemic therapy
   (ST) use surrounding radiation therapy (RT) predicts overall survival
   (OS) after RT for patients with brain metastases (BMs). Methods
   Provincial RT and pharmacy databases were used to review all adult
   patients in British Columbia, Canada, who received a first course of RT
   for BMs between 2012 and 2016 (n = 3095). Multivariate analysis on a
   randomly selected subset was used to develop an OS nomogram. Results In
   comparison to the 2096 non-recipients of ST after RT, the median OS of
   the 999 recipients of ST after RT was 5.0 (95\% Confidence interval (CI)
   4.1-6.0) months longer (p < 0.0001). Some types of ST after RT were
   independently predictive of OS: targeted therapy (hazard ratio (HR)
   0.42, CI 0.37-0.48), hormone therapy (HR 0.45, CI 0.36-0.55), cytotoxic
   chemotherapy (HR 0.71, CI 0.64-0.79), and immunotherapy (HR 0.64, CI
   0.37-1.06). Patients who discontinued ST after RT had 0.9 (CI 0.3-1.4)
   months shorter median OS than patients who received no ST before or
   after RT (p < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis of the 220-patient
   subset, established prognostic variables (extracranial disease,
   performance status, age, cancer diagnosis, and number of BMs), and the
   novel variables ``ST before RT{''} and ``Type of ST after RT{''}
   independently predicted OS. The nomogram predicted 6- and 12-month OS
   probability and median OS (bootstrap-corrected Harrell's Concordance
   Index = 0.70). Conclusions The type and timing of ST use surrounding RT
   predict OS for patients with BMs.}},

Title = {{Exploring the influencing factors of public traffic safety awareness in
   China}},
Journal = {{COGNITION TECHNOLOGY \& WORK}},
Abstract = {{This research aims to develop a public traffic safety awareness
   questionnaire and explore the factors influencing public traffic safety
   awareness in China. A questionnaire survey was conducted with 5200
   people in Jiaozuo, China, to assess their public traffic safety
   awareness. Based on 5029 effective samples, the developed public traffic
   safety awareness scale passed the reliability and validity tests and
   identified three factors: traffic safety behaviour, traffic safety
   attitude and traffic accident cognition. The Chinese version of the
   Traffic Climate Scale (three factors: external affective demand,
   internal requirements and functionality) and the Ten-Item Personality
   Inventory in China (five factors: extraversion, agreeableness,
   conscientiousness, emotional stability and openness) were also used in
   the questionnaire. The results of correlation analysis, difference
   analysis and multiple linear regression analysis show that in terms of
   individual factors, public traffic safety awareness is significantly
   related to age, education level, number of children and personality
   traits, and there are significant differences between genders and across
   occupations. In terms of environmental factors, public traffic safety
   awareness is significantly related to traffic safety education, traffic
   violation records, approval of traffic violations and traffic climate.
   Internal requirements, external emotional demands, conscientiousness and
   agreeableness can effectively explain and predict public traffic safety
   awareness. The research results provide a strong reference to help road
   traffic safety management departments formulate policies and play a
   positive role in preventing and reducing traffic accidents and ensuring
   public safety.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPORT \& SOCIAL ISSUES}},
Abstract = {{Through content analysis of sports media commentary focusing on the
   high-profile free agencies of NBA stars LeBron James and Kevin Durant,
   the author demonstrates how commercial sports media discourse responding
   to these critical exigencies strategically reinforces neoliberal
   ideology and parlays its disciplinary rhetoric into a derogatory
   ideological critique of James, Durant, and their contemporaries. The
   analysis demonstrates how media discourse surrounding James and Durant
   covertly but significantly reinforces cultural myths of rugged
   individualism, self-sufficiency, and competition as concomitant with
   success and self-worth while exalting idealized constructions of the
   prior generation of basketball icons, particularly Michael Jordan, whose
   mythic self-reliance is metonymic of an influx of nostalgic discourse
   which framed today's players as constitutionally inferior to the stars

Title = {{Separable elements and splittings of Weyl groups}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{374}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{We continue the study of separable elements in finite Weyl groups,
   introduced in {[}11]. These elements generalize the well-studied class
   of separable permutations. We show that the multiplication map W/U x U
   -> W is a length-additive bijection or splitting of the Weyl group W
   when U is an order ideal in right weak order generated by a separable
   element, where W/U denotes the generalized quotient. This generalizes a
   result for the symmetric group, answering an open problem of Wei {[}17].
   For a generalized quotient of the symmetric group, we show that this
   multiplication map is a bijection if and only if U is an order ideal in
   right weak order generated by a separable element, thereby classifying
   those generalized quotients which induce splittings of the symmetric
   group, resolving a problem of Bjorner and Wachs from 1988 {[}4]. We also
   prove that this map is always surjective when U is an order ideal in
   right weak order. Interpreting these sets of permutations as linear
   extensions of 2-dimensional posets gives the first direct combinatorial
   proof of an inequality due originally to Sidorenko in 1991, answering an
   open problem Morales, Pak, and Panova {[}13]. We also prove a new
   q-analog of Sidorenko's formula. All of these results are conjectured to
   extend to arbitrary finite Weyl groups.
   Finally, we show that separable elements in Ware in bijection with the
   faces of all dimensions of several copies of the graph associahedron of
   the Dynkin diagram of W.
   This correspondence associates to each separable element w a certain
   nested set; we give product formulas for the rank generating functions
   of the principal upper and lower order ideals generated by win terms of
   these nested sets, generalizing several known formulas. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Background Polyphenol intake assessment is a first step for evaluating
   relationships between polyphenols and health-related outcomes. Ningxia
   Hui Autonomous Region is one of the minority areas in China, which is
   primarily consists of arid, dry desert. Objectives This study was to
   make assessment about phenolics intake by university students from
   Ningxia of China. Methods This study employed data from a
   cross-sectional survey conducted from February to June 2018 in Ningxia
   Hui Autonomous Region of Northwest China. A total of 413 undergraduate
   students (143 boys, 270 girls), mean age 20.6 years, participated in the
   study. Food-frequency consumption and anthropometric measurements were
   included in the survey. According to phenol-explorer website, the amount
   of different classes of phenolic compounds were established. Statistics
   analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS 20.0. Results Profile of the
   student subjects showed low weight (19.1\%), overweight (6.8\%) and
   obesity (0.5\%). The mean value about phenolics intake was 1378 mg/day.
   The main polyphenols consumed were flavonoids (58.7\% of total
   polyphenols), followed by phenolic acids (38.1\%). Vegetables, fruits
   and cereals products were the most consumed foods, while infusions and
   sugar products were lower. Fruit was the main food sources of total
   polyphenols, especially apple (22.95\%), orange juice (19.03\%) and
   apple juice (3.93\%). Conclusions This is the first study on the
   polyphenol intake of university students in Ningxia of China. The
   present results will be benefit for further investigation on the role of

Title = {{Association Between Patient Frailty and Postoperative Mortality Across
   Multiple Noncardiac Surgical Specialties}},
Journal = {{JAMA SURGERY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{156}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Importance Frailty is an important risk factor for postoperative
   mortality. Whether the association between frailty and mortality is
   consistent across all surgical specialties, especially those
   predominantly performing lower stress procedures, remains unknown.
   Objective To examine the association between frailty and postoperative
   mortality across surgical specialties. Design, Setting, and Participants
   A cohort study was conducted across 9 noncardiac specialties in
   hospitals participating in the American College of Surgeons National
   Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and Veterans Affairs
   Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) from January 1, 2010,
   through December 31, 2014, using multivariable logistic regression to
   evaluate the association between frailty and postoperative mortality.
   Data analysis was conducted from September 15, 2019, to April 30, 2020.
   Patients 18 years or older undergoing noncardiac procedures were
   included. Exposures Risk Analysis Index measuring preoperative frailty
   categorized patients as robust (Risk Analysis Index <= 20), normal
   (21-29), frail (30-39), or very frail (>= 40). Operative Stress Score
   (OSS) categorized procedures as low (1-2), moderate (3), and high (4-5)
   stress. Specialties were categorized by case-mix as predominantly low
   intensity (>75\% OSS 1-2), moderate intensity (50\%-75\%), or high
   intensity (<50\%). Main Outcomes and Measures Thirty-day (both measures)
   and 180-day (VASQIP only) postoperative mortality. Results Of the
   patients evaluated in NSQIP (n = 2 339 031), 1 309 795 were women
   (56.0\%) and mean (SD) age was 56.49 (16.4) years. Of the patients
   evaluated in VASQIP (n = 426 578), 395 761 (92.78\%) were men and mean
   (SD) age was 61.1 (12.9) years. Overall, 30-day mortality was 1.2\% in
   NSQIP and 1.0\% in VASQIP, and 180-day mortality in VASQIP was 3.4\%.
   Frailty and OSS distributions differed substantially across the 9
   specialties. Patterns of 30-day mortality for frail and very frail
   patients were similar in NSQIP and VASQIP for low-, moderate-, and
   high-intensity specialties. Frailty was a consistent, independent risk
   factor for 30- and 180-day mortality across all specialties. For
   example, in NSQIP, for plastic surgery, a low-intensity specialty, the
   odds of 30-day mortality in very frail (adjusted odds ratio {[}aOR],
   27.99; 95\% CI, 14.67-53.39) and frail (aOR, 5.1; 95\% CI, 3.03-8.58)
   patients were statistically significantly higher than for normal
   patients. This was also true in neurosurgery, a moderate-intensity
   specialty, for very frail (aOR, 9.8; 95\% CI, 7.68-12.50) and frail
   (aOR, 4.18; 95\% CI, 3.58-4.89) patients and in vascular surgery, a
   high-intensity specialty, for very frail (aOR, 10.85; 95\% CI,
   9.83-11.96) and frail (aOR, 3.42; 95\% CI, 3.19-3.67) patients.
   Conclusions and Relevance In this study, frailty was associated with
   postoperative mortality across all noncardiac surgical specialties
   regardless of case-mix. Preoperative frailty assessment could be
   implemented across all specialties to facilitate risk stratification and
   shared decision-making.
   Question Is the association between frailty and postoperative mortality
   consistent across noncardiac surgical specialties? Findings In this
   cohort study of over 2.7 million unique patients from 2 large, national
   data sets, frailty was associated with postoperative mortality across
   all noncardiac surgical specialties independent of operative stress.
   Frail patients in all surgical specialties had high mortality rates
   following low- and moderate-stress procedures. Meaning This study
   suggests that preoperative frailty assessment should be implemented
   across all specialties, regardless of case-mix, to facilitate risk
   stratification and shared decision-making.
   This cohort study examines the association between frailty and mortality
   in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, location information has contributed to a
   significant part in various Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications.
   Designing efficient localization algorithms is still a challenging task
   for many researchers. Our work emphasizes on range-free algorithm
   because of less cost and better performance in dense and indoor areas as
   compared to range-based algorithms. Mostly in real world scenario the
   network is anisotropic due to multiple holes and obstacles. Many recent
   range-free algorithms for anisotropic networks are complex with
   additional overhead of computation and assume even distribution of
   anchors, but it is not possible to deploy anchor nodes uniformly.
   DV-maxHop is one of the variants of DV-Hop algorithm which is an optimal
   range free algorithm for both isotropic and anisotropic networks, but
   still fails to achieve the desired accuracy in presence of non-uniform
   dissemination of anchor nodes. In context of exploring this limitation
   of DV-maxHop, we propose a novel strategy known as Improved DV-maxHop
   algorithm for localization. In our work, we correct the distances by
   modifying the average one hop of each link between anchor nodes and
   unknown nodes using a correction method. This correction helps the
   sensors to localize more accurately according to the distribution of
   sensor nodes in the network. Simulations has been performed and results
   indicate significant improvement is achieved with Improved DV-maxHop
   algorithm, when measuring metrics such as localization error, while
   varying other simulation parameters such as Anchor ratio and changing
   topology of anchors as well as sensors. Results prove that our proposed
   algorithm minimizes the localization error efficiently without requiring
   any additional hardware or increasing communication overhead.}},

Abstract = {{We derive a simple criterion that ensures uniqueness, Lipschitz
   stability and global convergence of Newton's method for the finite
   dimensional zero-finding problem of a continuously differentiable,
   pointwise convex and monotonic function. Our criterion merely requires
   to evaluate the directional derivative of the forward function at
   finitely many evaluation points and for finitely many directions. We
   then demonstrate that this result can be used to prove uniqueness,
   stability and global convergence for an inverse coefficient problem with
   finitely many measurements. We consider the problem of determining an
   unknown inverse Robin transmission coefficient in an elliptic PDE. Using
   a relation to monotonicity and localized potentials techniques, we show
   that a piecewise-constant coefficient on an a-priori known partition
   with a-priori known bounds is uniquely determined by finitely many
   boundary measurements and that it can be uniquely and stably
   reconstructed by a globally convergent Newton iteration. We derive a
   constructive method to identify these boundary measurements, calculate
   the stability constant and give a numerical example.}},

Abstract = {{Ceramic membranes for emulsification are generally fabricated by
   particle stacking. As a result, their small adjacent pore distances and
   hydrophilicity cause water droplets to coalesce when preparing
   monodisperse submicron water-in-diesel (W/D) emulsions. Here, we present
   a two dimensional-modified membrane emulsification model for the first
   time, with the development of a hydrophobic MXene-modified ceramic
   membrane with a water contact angle of 144.7 +/- 1.2 degrees. Benefiting
   from their large lateral size, MXene nanomaterials not only increase the
   distance between channels but also provide longitudinal-lateral
   transport pathways for dispersed phases. Therefore, the dispersed phase
   droplets can roll along the interlayer nanochannels of the
   MXene-modified membrane before converging with the continuous phase,
   thereby preventing the coalescence of emulsions. The MXene-modified
   membrane presents an excellent emulsification ability for preparing W/D
   emulsions, and the resulting diesel emulsions are at a submicron level
   with a unimodal distribution, an average particle size of 400 nm, and a
   particle size distribution coefficient of 0.7. This novel MXene-modified
   membrane for emulsification is of great significance since it provides a
   simple and promising strategy for the development of monodisperse nano
   or submicron emulsions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Emerging evidence suggests a definite neuropsychiatric
   sequela of the SARS-CoV-2 infection possibly from a direct effect of the
   virus on the central nervous system. Although the pathophysiology of the
   virus and the epidemiology of its impact are only just being unraveled,
   clinical characteristics, and outcomes specifically among patients with
   primary psychiatric disorders who are hospitalized with COVID-19 remain
   unclear and unreported.
   Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients with
   psychiatric diagnoses who were hospitalized patients with severe
   SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community hospital in New York City.
   Results: More than 80\% of the cohort are African Americans.
   Hypertension (61.2\%), morbid obesity (41.8\%) and diabetes (27.6\%)
   were the most prevalent co-morbid medical conditions. Schizophrenia
   (32.7\%) and Major Depressive disorder (29.6\%) were the most common
   psychiatric diagnoses reported. At triage, the most common presentations
   were fever (57.1\%), cough (55.1\%), myalgia (32.7\%), fatigue (25.5\%),
   and altered mental status (19.4\%). Distinctly high infection-related
   inflammatory markers and cytokines were also reported with median values
   including CRP (85.5 mg/ml), D-dimer (2061 ng/ml), procalcitonin (1.1
   ng/ml) and IL-6 (65.5 pg/ml).
   Conclusion: Results from this study strengthen preliminary data that
   show an overrepresented COVID-19 burden in the African American
   community. This further suggests that the same holds true among a cohort
   of patients with psychiatric conditions hospitalized with severe
   COVID-19 infection. Having comorbid mental illness and older age were
   observed as independent factors of morbidity and mortality. The finding
   of elevated inflammatory markers in this cohort may account for the
   prolonged hospitalization and hospital course, morbidity and mortality
   among COVID patients with comorbid psychiatric diagnoses and requires
   further investigation.}},

Title = {{On retrial queue with customer balking and feedback subject to server
   breakdowns}},
Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by some real stochastic service systems, we study a feedback
   retrial queue with customer balking and unreliable servers (servers
   subject to breakdowns). A customer will either join a retrial orbit or
   balk if all servers are busy upon his arrival. After a service
   completion, the customer either leave the system or enter the retrial
   group again for additional service. The customer who is interrupted by
   the server failure will be served by another server if available;
   otherwise, he will be contacted later and treated as leaving the system.
   We use a quasi-birth-and-death process to analyze this system with
   almost all possible uncertain factors and derive major performance
   measures of the system. We also develop a cost function determining the
   optimal parameter settings of the system under the stability condition.
   Probabilistic Global Search Lausanne approach is employed in solving the
   optimization issue. The effects of parameters on performance measures of
   the system are examined numerically. Finally, we discuss the application
   of the model in the telephone medical consulting service system.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Salivary cortisol level is considered a prominent depression biomarker,
   as saliva induces less stress as compared to blood. The study was
   performed in the physiology department, Sheikh Zayed Medical Institute
   Lahore from April 2015 to December 2015. Sixty participants, including
   14 (46.67\%) males and 16 (53.33\%) females, in each non-depressive and
   depressive group of over 17 years of age, were undertaken. The
   depression diagnostics were performed both outdoors and in clinics and
   confirmed with the standards of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
   Mental Disorders and Beck's Inventory. Saliva specimens were collected
   and processed for enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), and absorbance was
   calculated on a microtiter plate reader. The statistics with the
   Statistical Package for the Social Packages (SPSS) 26.0 (IBM Corp.,
   Armonk, NY) show that patients of the non-depressive category exhibited
   mean ages 35.73 +/- 6.89 years and 39.10 +/- 6.89 years in the
   depressive group (p-value: 0.178). The mean cortisol level was 1.46 +/-
   0.91 ng/ml among non-depressive and 2.23 +/- 1.69 in depressive patients
   (p-value: 0.031). The mean depression score among non-depressive was
   5.73 +/- 4.05 and 52.03 +/- 5.08 while there was no statistical
   difference in the mean height and weight of subjects in normal and
   depressive patients (p-value: 0.0001). Meanwhile, the mean cortisol
   level was 1.46 +/- 0.91 ng/ml among non-depressive patients, while it
   was 2.23 +/- 1.69 in the depressive group, with no statistical
   difference in mean ages (p-value: 0.031). These findings proved the
   cortisol level directly linked with severe depression and useful for
   depression diagnostics and management.}},

Journal = {{OCULAR IMMUNOLOGY AND INFLAMMATION}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Multifocal choroiditis (MFC) is described as a chronic bilateral
   progressive inflammatory outer chorioretinopathy, that usually affects
   healthy myopic Caucasian women with no associated systemic/ocular
   diseases. This patient had a severe acute presentation of aggressive
   multifocal choroiditis that was treated with systemic steroids.
   Case presentation
   This is a retrospective case report of a 30-year-old, white, European,
   female who was 10 weeks pregnant. She had bilateral severe vision loss
   and rapidly progressive rash and arthritis. The patient was extensively
   investigated for inflammatory and infectious etiologies by a
   multidisciplinary team including rheumatology and obstetrics and
   gynecology. Antistreptolysin levels were moderately raised. Serial
   retinal optical coherence tomography scans were performed and were
   critical for assessing disease activity and demonstrating the extent of
   retinal and choroidal lesions.
   Conclusion
   This was a challenging case as the patient was pregnant. Nevertheless, a
   multidisciplinary team, opted for treatment with systemic steroids which
   then lead to recovery of her vision.}},

Volume = {{37}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Atrial inflammation plays an important role in initiating
   atrial fibrosis, which could perpetuate atrial fibrillation (AF).
   However, the method of visualization of atrial inflammation has not been
   established. We sought to investigate whether the intensive atrial
   inflammation caused by cryoballoon ablation (CBA) could be detected by
   positron emission tomography/ magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) and
   whether the atrial inflammation could be associated with consequent
   fibrosis.
   Methods: A total of 10 paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients after CBA
   were enrolled. To detect and quantify intensive atrial inflammation,
   PET/MRI was performed to assess regional F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose
   (F-18-FDG) uptake one day after the CBA, and the standardized uptake
   values (SUV) max were compared between the pulmonary vein (PV) antrum
   where CBA could be applied and the healthy left atrial (LA) wall where
   CBA could not be applied. Furthermore, the atrial inflammation one day
   after the procedure and atrial fibrosis areas one month after the
   procedure were three-dimensionally quantified by PET/MRI and
   late-gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI),
   respectively.
   Results: The mean SUV max at the PV antrum was significantly higher than
   that on the healthy LA wall (2.12 +/- 0.35 vs 1.73 +/- 0.30, P =
   .00021). The volume of the atrial inflammation strongly correlated with
   that of the atrial fibrosis (r = .94 {[}.76-.99], P = .00006).
   Conclusions: The atrial inflammation after CBA could be detected by
   PET/MRI. CBA-induced atrial inflammation was strongly associated with
   consequent lesion maturation.}},

Abstract = {{Asthma is a chronic airway disease often due to sensitization to
   aeroallergens, especially house dust mite allergens (HDMs). The
   Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus group 2 (Der p 2), is one of the most
   representative HDM allergens and is recognized by more than 90\% of
   HDM-allergic patients. In mouse models, all asthma-related features can
   be prevented by prophylactic administration of Dermatophagoides
   pteronyssinus 2-derived peptide (Der p 2.1). However, it is unknown
   whether it is able to treat well-established asthma in mice and humans.
   We aimed here to evaluate the efficacy of Der p 2.1 immunotherapy in a
   mouse, humanized mouse, and asthmatic patients. Asthma related-features
   were analyzed through airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR),
   allergen-specific IgE, and lung histology in mice and humanized mice.
   Immune profile was analyzed using lung and blood from mice and severe
   asthmatic patients respectively. T cell and dendritic cell (DC)
   polarization was evaluated using co-culture of bone marrow derived cells
   (BMDCs) and naive T cell from naive mice. Mice and humanized mice both
   have a reduced AHR, lung tissue alteration, and HDM-specific IgE under
   Der p 2.1 treatment. Concerning the immune profile, T helper 2 cells
   (Th2) and T helper 17 cells (Th17) were significantly reduced in both
   mice and humanized mice lung and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
   (PBMCs) from severe asthmatic patients after Der p 2.1 incubation. The
   downregulation of T cell polarization seems to be linked to an increase
   of IL-10-secreting DC under Der p 2.1 treatment in both mice and severe
   asthmatic patients. This study shows that allergen-derived peptide
   immunotherapy abrogates asthma-related features in mice and humanized
   mice by reducing Th2 and Th17 cells polarization via IL-10-secreting DC.
   These results suggest that Der p 2.1 peptide immunotherapy could be a
   promising approach to treat both Th2 and Th17 immunity in asthma.}},

Abstract = {{We revisit the susceptible-infectious-recovered/removed (SIR) model
   which is one of the simplest compartmental models. Many epidemological
   models are derivatives of this basic form. While an analytic solution to
   the SIR model is known in parametric form for the case of a
   time-independent infection rate, we derive an analytic solution for the
   more general case of a time-dependent infection rate, that is not
   limited to a certain range of parameter values. Our approach allows us
   to derive several exact analytic results characterizing all quantities,
   and moreover explicit, non-parametric, and accurate analytic
   approximants for the solution of the SIR model for time-independent
   infection rates. We relate all parameters of the SIR model to a
   measurable, usually reported quantity, namely the cumulated number of
   infected population and its first and second derivatives at an initial
   time t = 0, where data is assumed to be available. We address the
   question of how well the differential rate of infections is captured by
   the Gauss model (GM). To this end we calculate the peak height, width,
   and position of the bell-shaped rate analytically. We find that the SIR
   is captured by the GM within a range of times, which we discuss in
   detail. We prove that the SIR model exhibits an asymptotic behavior at
   large times that is different from the logistic model, while the
   difference between the two models still decreases with increasing
   reproduction factor. This part A of our work treats the original SIR
   model to hold at all times, while this assumption will be relaxed in
   part B. Relaxing this assumption allows us to formulate initial
   conditions incompatible with the original SIR model.}},

Title = {{Blue collar timescapes: work, health, and pension eligibility age for
   mature age Australian bus drivers}},
Journal = {{CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Assumptions about time, value, labour, and health coalesce in the policy
   decision to extend the pension eligibility age in Australia from 65 to
   67 years. Acknowledging the multiple, often incompatible ways in which
   time is conceptualised and experienced, we question the expectation of
   extending Australians' working lives. Drawing on semi-structured
   interviews with 19 male and female bus drivers over the age of 55 in
   Australia, we illustrate that older blue collar workers may accumulate
   chronic health conditions that not only limit their ability to maintain
   the strict time-discipline required to remain in the workforce, but also
   introduce demands on their time beyond paid employment (including those
   required for the management of chronic health conditions). Poor health,
   and the multiple ways in which it constrains labour participation and
   time, fosters diverse, unequal, and uneven experiences of the final
   years of work for these blue collar workers, which may not allow them to
   meet the policy expectation to work until the age of 67. We argue that
   by failing to acknowledge the long-term health effects of blue collar
   work and its work-limiting bodily effects, raising the pension age
   devalues industrial work histories and manual labour. Finally,
   acknowledging the social milestone of retirement, we question the moral
   dimensions of extending the pension eligibility age.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Establishing methods to evaluate interactions between
   hospital staff and patients with a dementia is vital to inform care
   delivery. This study aimed to assess the validity of Quality of
   Interactions Schedule (QuIS) ratings in relation to the care experiences
   of people with a dementia in a general hospital setting.
   Methods Four hundred and ninety face-to-face interactions between staff
   and patients with a dementia (n = 107) on six medicine for older people
   wards in a UK National Health Service hospital were observed and rated
   using QuIS and the Psychological Well-Being in Cognitively Impaired
   Persons (PWB-CIP) tool. We also invited patient ratings for longer
   interactions (n = 217). Analyses explored associations between QuIS
   ratings, PWB-CIP ratings and patient ratings.
   Results When QuIS was rated negative, the mean researcher-rated patient
   psychological well-being was lower (PWB = 7.9 out of maximum score of
   10) than when QuIS was non-negative (PWB = 8.8, p = 0.036). Negative
   QuIS ratings were associated with negative ratings on seven out of ten
   individual PWB-CIP items. When QuIS was rated negative, the associated
   patient rating was 4\% less likely to be `happy'. The patient was also
   4\% more likely to rate the interaction as `kind'. Patients struggled to
   participate in care ratings.
   Conclusions Some patients found responding to researcher questions
   difficult or not relevant, reflecting the need for development of more
   suitable methods in this field. Our findings of an association between
   lower quality QuIS-rated interactions and lower psychological well-being
   lend support to the use of QuIS with patient populations that include
   people with a dementia.}},

   computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). This work aims to develop a deep
   learning-based method for breast tumor segmentation using
   three-dimensional (3D) ABUS automatically.
   Methods For breast tumor segmentation in ABUS, we developed a Mask
   scoring region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) that consists
   of five subnetworks, that is, a backbone, a regional proposal network, a
   region convolutional neural network head, a mask head, and a mask score
   head. A network block building direct correlation between mask quality
   and region class was integrated into a Mask scoring R-CNN based
   framework for the segmentation of new ABUS images with ambiguous regions
   of interest (ROIs). For segmentation accuracy evaluation, we
   retrospectively investigated 70 patients with breast tumor confirmed
   with needle biopsy and manually delineated on ABUS, of which 40 were
   used for fivefold cross-validation and 30 were used for hold-out test.
   The comparison between the automatic breast tumor segmentations and the
   manual contours was quantified by I) six metrics including Dice
   similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard index, 95\% Hausdorff distance
   (HD95), mean surface distance (MSD), residual mean square distance
   (RMSD), and center of mass distance (CMD); II) Pearson correlation
   analysis and Bland-Altman analysis.
   Results The mean (median) DSC was 85\% +/- 10.4\% (89.4\%) and 82.1\%
   +/- 14.5\% (85.6\%) for cross-validation and hold-out test,
   respectively. The corresponding HD95, MSD, RMSD, and CMD of the two
   tests was 1.646 +/- 1.191 and 1.665 +/- 1.129 mm, 0.489 +/- 0.406 and
   0.475 +/- 0.371 mm, 0.755 +/- 0.755 and 0.751 +/- 0.508 mm, and 0.672
   +/- 0.612 and 0.665 +/- 0.729 mm. The mean volumetric difference (mean
   and +/- 1.96 standard deviation) was 0.47 cc ({[}-0.77, 1.71)) for the
   cross-validation and 0.23 cc ({[}-0.23 0.69]) for hold-out test,
   respectively.
   Conclusion We developed a novel Mask scoring R-CNN approach for the
   automated segmentation of the breast tumor in ABUS images and
   demonstrated its accuracy for breast tumor segmentation. Our
   learning-based method can potentially assist the clinical CAD of breast
   cancer using 3D ABUS imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Microalgal oil is considered a promising candidate for edible oils.
   However, investigation of the refining processes of microalgal oil has
   been limited, especially deacidification. In this work, microcrystalline
   cellulose (MCC) was pretreated using different methods and utilized for
   the first time in the deacidification of microalgal oil. Detection
   results from FTIR and XRD indicated alkali pretreatment had a
   significant effect on the structure of MCC. Some inter- and
   intramolecular hydrogen bonds in AMCC (alkali-pretreated MCC) were
   destroyed, and crystallinity index of cellulose decreased, which
   increased its adsorption capacity and the reaction of OH groups with
   free fatty acids. Some NaOH was adsorbed into AMCC through cellulose
   swelling, which also contributed to deacidification. The interaction
   with oil was also improved with many cracks and voids on the surface of
   AMCC. AMCC could reduce the acid value to about 2 mg KOH/g.
   Comparatively, original MCC and MCC pretreated with microwave or
   ultrasound did not exhibit the ability to deacidify. Furthermore, the
   conditions of alkali treatment were optimized. Treatment with 20\% NaOH
   for 20 min was optimal. Compared with other adsorbents, such as sodium
   silicate and chitosan treated with alkali and resin, only AMCC could
   effectively reduce acid value while maintaining high lipid recovery.
   Therefore, AMCC was considered a better adsorbent for the
   deacidification of microalgal oil.}},

Abstract = {{Heterostructures with a rich phase boundary are attractive for
   surface-mediated microwave absorption (MA) materials. However,
   understanding the MA mechanisms behind the heterogeneous interface
   remains a challenge. Herein, a phosphine (PH3) vapor-assisted phase and
   structure engineering strategy was proposed to construct
   three-dimensional (3D) porous Ni12P5/Ni2P heterostructures as microwave
   absorbers and explore the role of the heterointerface in MA performance.
   The results indicated that the heterogeneous interface between Ni12P5
   and Ni2P not only creates sufficient lattice defects for inducing
   dipolar polarization but also triggers uneven spatial charge
   distribution for enhancing interface polarization. Furthermore, the
   porous structure and proper component could provide an abundant
   heterogeneous interface to strengthen the above polarization relaxation
   process, thereby greatly optimizing the electromagnetic parameters and
   improving the MA performance. Profited by 3D porous heterostructure
   design, P400 could achieve the maximum reflection loss of -50.06 dB and
   an absorption bandwidth of 3.30 GHz with an ultrathin thickness of 1.20
   mm. Furthermore, simulation results confirmed its superior ability
   (14.97 dB m(2) at 90 degrees) to reduce the radar cross section in
   practical applications. This finding may shed light on the understanding
   and design of advanced heterogeneous MA materials.}},

Abstract = {{Immune checkpoint-targeting antibodies brought a recent breakthrough in
   cancer immunotherapy, but the development of small molecule checkpoint
   inhibitors is lagging behind. Here, the characterization of a
   macrocyclic peptide (p101) capable of blocking the PD-L1/PD-1 immune
   checkpoint is reported at the interface of cancer and immune cells. NMR
   and other physicochemical data demonstrate that the macrocycle binds to
   PD-L1 to sterically hinder its interaction with PD-1. The crystal
   structure of the complex highlights the detailed features of the binding
   site and demonstrates that the interaction is primarily guided by
   hydrophobic forces. A reporter PD-L1/PD-1 blockade bioassay demonstrates
   that p101 is able to inhibit the interaction in the cellular
   environment. Finally, it is shown that p101 releases the immune response
   of primary human T-cells from PD-L1 mediated inhibition.}},

Title = {{The transsylvian corridor through minimally invasive transcranial
   approaches: a comparative anatomical study}},
Journal = {{NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW}},
Abstract = {{Minimally invasive transcranial approaches (MITAs) continue to expand in
   popularity in neurosurgery. Only few MITAs allow sufficient sylvian
   exposure to enable wide use of the transsylvian corridor. In this study,
   we aim to compare the transsylvian corridor in two MITAs: the
   minipterional (MPTa) and the extended supraorbital eyebrow approaches
   (XSEa). Eight cadaver heads were used to quantify the surgical exposure
   and maneuverability along the sylvian fissure and the insular lobe
   provided by the MPTa and the XSEa. Surgical exposure was calculated by
   means of the exposed length of the sylvian fissure and by the area
   framed within three extreme points in the insular lobe. Maneuverability
   was assessed by means of the surgical freedom along the sylvian cistern.
   XSEa provides twice the frontal exposure and half of the temporal
   exposure in comparison to the MPTa (p < 0.001 and p = 0.02,
   respectively). No significant differences were found between the two
   craniotomies in the length of the exposure of the sylvian fissure, area
   of insular exposure, or surgical freedom. Both the MPTa and the XSEa
   afford sufficient grades of exposure along the sylvian fissure and the

Abstract = {{Aims Cardiovascular disease has been recognized as a major determinant
   of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vulnerability and severity.
   Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a functional receptor for
   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is
   up-regulated in patients with heart failure. We sought to examine the
   potential association between reduced left ventricular ejection fraction
   (LVEF) and the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
   Methods and results Of the 1162 patients with acute coronary syndrome
   (ACS) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention between February
   2014 and October 2018, we enrolled 889 patients with available clinical
   follow-up data. Follow-up was conducted by telephone interviews 1 month
   after the start of the French lockdown which began on 17 March 2020.
   Patients were divided into two groups according to LVEF 60;40\% (reduced
   LVEF) (n = 91) or >= 40\% (moderately reduced + preserved LVEF) (n =
   798). The incidence of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death was
   significantly higher in the reduced LVEF group as compared with the
   moderately reduced + preserved LVEF group (9\% vs. 1\%, P 60; 0.001). No
   association was found between discontinuation of ACE-inhibitor or
   angiotensin-receptor blockers and COVID-19 test positivity. By
   multivariate logistic regression analysis, reduced LVEF was an
   independent predictor of COVID-19 hospitalization or death (odds ratio:
   6.91, 95\% confidence interval: 2.60 to 18.35, P 60; 0.001).
   Conclusions In a large cohort of patients with previous ACS, reduced
   LVEF was associated with increased susceptibility to COVID-19.
   Aggressive COVID-19 testing and therapeutic strategies may be considered
   for patient with impaired heart function.}},

Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{Infection with parasitic worms (helminths) alters host immune responses
   and can inhibit pathogenic inflammation. Helminth infection promotes a
   strong Th2 and T regulatory response while suppressing Th1 and Th17
   function. Th2 responses are largely dependent on transcriptional
   programs directed by Stat6-signaling. We examined the importance of
   intact T cell Stat6 signaling on helminth-induced suppression of murine
   colitis that results from T cell transfer into immune-deficient mice.
   Colonization with the intestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus
   bakeri resolves WT T cell transfer colitis. However, if the transferred
   T cells lack intact Stat6 then helminth exposure failed to attenuate
   colitis or suppress MLN T cell IFN-gamma or IL17 production. Loss of
   Stat6 signaling resulted in decreased IL10 and increased IFN-gamma
   co-expression by IL-17(+) T cells. We also transferred T cells from mice
   with constitutive T cell expression of activated Stat6 (Stat6VT). These
   mice developed a severe eosinophilic colitis that also was not
   attenuated by helminth infection. These results show that T cell
   expression of intact but regulated Stat6 signaling is required for
   helminth infection-associated regulation of pathogenic intestinal
   inflammation.}},

Title = {{Structural and mechanical characteristics of sphere packings near the
   jamming transition: From fully amorphous to quasiordered structures}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Mechanically stable sphere packings are generated in three-dimensional
   space using the discrete element method, which spans a wide range in
   structural order, ranging from fully amorphous to quasiordered
   structures, as characterized by the bond orientational order parameter.
   As the packing pressure p varies from the marginally rigid limit at the
   jamming transition (p approximate to 0) to that of more robust systems
   (p >> 0), the coordination number z follows a familiar scaling relation
   with pressure, namely, Delta z = z - z(c) similar to p(1/2), where z(c)
   = 2d = 6 (d = 3 is the spatial dimension). While it has previously been
   noted that Delta z does indeed remain the control parameter for
   determining the packing properties, here we show how the packing
   structure plays an influential role on the mechanical (elastic)
   properties of the packings. Specifically, we find that the elastic (bulk
   K and shear G) moduli, generically referred to as M, become functions of
   both Delta z and the structure, to the extent that M - M-c similar to
   Delta z. Here, Mc are values of the elastic moduli at the jamming
   transition, which depend on the structure of the packings. In
   particular, the zero shear modulus, G(c) = 0, is a special feature of
   fully amorphous packings, whereas more ordered packings take larger
   positive values, G(c) > 0. The finite G(c) > 0 in the ordered packings
   excites acoustic vibrations which add to floppylike modes controlled by
   Az and enhance the plateau in the vibrational density of states.}},

Abstract = {{Mr. Reese is a high school business mathematics teacher, responsible for
   teaching a group of diverse learners in 11th and 12th grades. Students
   in Mr. Reese's course completed the basic high school mathematics
   requirements, and his course is designed to provide additional
   mathematics instruction in personal and business finance. Many of his
   students struggled in previous mathematics coursework; therefore, their
   interest and enthusiasm toward mathematics was low. Early in the school
   year, Mr. Reese noticed his students often asked questions like, ``Why
   do we need to know this?{''} and ``When are we ever going to use this in
   real life?{''} That's when Mr. Reese started doing some research and
   found a teaching method called project-based learning (PjBL). Mr. Reese
   used the PjBL format to create the ``Car Project{''} for his students to
   work on over the course of 5 weeks. He started the unit with a visit to
   a local car dealership, where students sat in new and used cars,
   discussed the car-buying process with a salesperson, toured the repair
   and body shop, and roamed the lot for their ``dream car.{''} On the bus
   ride back to school, the students excitedly discussed the experience,
   searching the internet on their phones for cars that caught their eye.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{The exponential character of the recent Covid-19 outbreak requires a
   change in strategy from containment to mitigation. Meanwhile, most
   countries apply social distancing with the objective to keep the number
   of critical cases below the capabilities of the health care system. Due
   to the novelty and rapid spread of the virus, an a priori assessment of
   this strategy was not possible. In this study, we present a model-based
   systems analysis to assess the effectiveness of social distancing
   measures in terms of intensity and duration of application. Results show
   a super-linear scaling between intensity (percent contact reduction) and
   required duration of application to have an added value (a lower number
   of fatalities). This holds true for an effective reproduction of R>1 and
   is reverted for R<1. If R is not reduced below 1, secondary effects of
   required long-term isolation are likely to unravel the added value of
   disease mitigation. If an extinction is not feasible, we recommend
   moderate social-distancing that is well balanced against capability
   limits of national health-care systems.}},

   of the obtained catalyst was studied in environmentally friendly
   dimethyl carbonate (DMC). Although VII exhibited low efficiency in
   cross-metathesis (CM) with electron-deficient partners, good to
   excellent results were noted for substrates featuring easy to isomerise
   C-C double bonds. This includes polyfunctional substrates of medicinal
   chemistry interest, such as analogues of psychoactive 5F-PB-22 and
   NM-2201 and two PDE5 inhibitors-Sildenafil and Vardenafil. Finally, a
   larger scale ring-closing metathesis (RCM) of a Vardenafil derivative

Title = {{Ethnicity, racism and housing: discourse analysis of New Zealand housing
   research}},
Journal = {{HOUSING STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{Within the last decade, the notion of a housing crisis emerged as a key
   issue on national political agendas across nation-states. The overall
   decline in homeownership is even sharper along racial lines. The way
   race/ethnicity is captured in housing research has important
   implications for how racial disparities are explained and addressed.
   This paper uses a critical discourse analysis to examine how ethnicity
   and race are represented in New Zealand housing research published
   between 2013 and 2019. The analysis reveals a lack of attention devoted
   to explaining racial disparities in housing research. Only one article
   from a sample of 103 referenced the concepts `racism' and `institutional
   racism' to explain institutional barriers that adversely affect
   Indigenous people engaging with home-lending institutions. This paper
   argues that housing scholarship is an important space for understanding
   how policies institutionalize racism to exclude marginalized bodies,
   especially through predatory lending practices, loan denial, and
   segregation. This paper concludes with a discussion of the social
   implications of race-neutral explanations of housing-related issues.}},

Title = {{Verbal Response Latency as a Behavioral Indicator of Diminished Wish to
   Live in a Clinical Sample of Active Duty Army Personnel with Recent
   Suicidal Ideation}},
Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF SUICIDE RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   Research on risk factors of suicide attempt has yielded little
   improvement in imminent risk detection for clinicians, due in part to
   the inherent limitations of self-report methodologies. Therefore,
   objective behavioral indicators of suicide risk that can be implemented
   practically with little cost in clinical settings are needed.
   Method
   The current study examined verbal response latency, measured as the
   length of time to answer a question asking about reasons for living
   (i.e., What are your reasons for living or not killing yourself?), as a
   potential indicator of suicide risk among 97 active duty Army personnel
   presenting to an emergency department or behavioral health clinic for
   current suicide ideation and/or a recent suicide attempt.
   Results
   Verbal response latency was significantly correlated with diminished
   wish to live at the participant level but was not significantly
   correlated with wish to die or overall severity of suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion
   Verbal response latency may serve as an objective indicator of suicide
   risk.}},

Abstract = {{Monolayers (MLs) of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as WSe2
   and MoSe2 can be placed by dry stamping directly on broadband dielectric
   resonators, which have the ability to enhance the spontaneous emission
   rate and brightness of solid-state emitters at room temperature. We show
   strongly enhanced emission and directivity modifications in
   room-temperature photoluminescence mapping experiments. By varying TMD
   material (WSe2 vs MoSe2) transferred on silicon nanoresonators with
   various designs (planarized vs nonplanarized), we experimentally
   separate the different physical mechanisms that govern the global light
   emission enhancement. For WSe2 and MoSe2, we address the effects of Mie
   resonances and strain in the monolayer. For WSe2, an important
   additional contribution comes from out-of-plane exciton dipoles. This
   paves the way for more targeted designs of TMD-Si nanoresonator
   structures for room-temperature applications.}},

Title = {{Seed morphology and sculpture of invasive Impatiens capensis Meerb. from
   different habitats}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Impatiens capensis is an annual plant native to eastern North America
   that is currently spreading across Europe. In Poland, due to this
   plant's rapid spread in the secondary range and high competitiveness in
   relation to native species, it is considered a locally invasive species.
   The microstructure of seeds is an important tool for solving various
   taxonomic problems and also provides data useful for determining the
   impact of various environmental factors on the phenotypic variability of
   species. This issue is particularly important in regard to invasive
   species which occupy a wide range of habitats in the invaded range.
   There are few reports on seed size and thus far no descriptions of the
   seed ultrastructure of I. capensis in the analyzed literature. We
   present new data on the seed morphology of I. capensis growing in
   different habitats and conditions in the secondary range of the species.
   The studied populations differed significantly in each of the
   investigated traits (seed length, width, circumference, area, roundness,
   and mass). Our findings showed that anthropogenic disturbances in
   habitats and some soil parameters (presence of carbonates, potassium,
   loose sand, and moisture) were statistically significant with various
   seed sizes and morphology in the studied populations of I. capensis.
   Moreover, our studies showed maximum seed length (5.74 mm) and width
   (3.21 mm) exceeding those values given in the available literature. For
   the first time, we also provide a detailed SEM study of the
   ultrastructure of the seed coat of I. capensis. There are two types of
   epidermal cells on the seeds: (a) between the ribs (elongated with
   straight anticlinal walls, slightly concave outer periclinal walls, and
   micropapillate secondary sculpture on the edges with anticyclic walls),
   and (b) on the ribs (isodiametric cells with straight anticlinal walls
   and concave outer periclinal walls). Unlike the variability of size and
   weight of seeds, the coat ornamentation has turned out to be a steady
   feature within the studied secondary range of I. capensis.}},

   ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. UV-vis technique indicated a sharp
   peak in area 416 nm and transmission electron microscopy pictures show
   that the shape of the nanoparticles is spherical and the mean diameter
   of the synthesised nanoparticle is 13 nm. The silver and silver
   oxide-nanoparticles (Ag/Ag2O-NPs) exhibited antimicrobial properties
   against positive/negative infective bacteria for instance Staphylococcus

Title = {{Genealogies and Juxtapositions: Traces of Potting Communities and Firing
   Facilities in Lake Titicaca Basin}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL METHOD AND THEORY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a genealogy of practice approach for the
   historical analysis and comparison of Andean ceramic firing. This effort
   was set in motion by the similarity of two sets of ash mounds observed
   in the Lake Titicaca Basin of Bolivia, one modern and one from the Late
   Intermediate Period (A.D. 1100-1450). We eschew an ethnoarchaeological
   perspective in favor of considering their position within a longer
   genealogy of potting practice. We argue that a genealogical perspective
   foregrounds ephemeral evidence that is often ignored in dominant
   narratives, highlights the emergent nature of practices, and draws
   attention to subject formation across generations. We examine the extant

Abstract = {{The possible consequences of top predators for the success of
   restoration actions for animals is still poorly understood. Our main
   objective was to analyze whether there could be a risk of creating
   habitats with an excess of predation by top predators when carrying out
   actions to improve cliff habitats for cliff-nesting birds at mining
   sites. We surveyed 28 mining sites in Spain to obtain information
   regarding the Eagle Owl's (Bubo bubo) presence and diet, and analyzed
   its relationship with the density of cliff-nesting birds and rabbits
   (Oryctolagus cuniculus, its main prey) at the mining sites. We detected
   Eagle Owls in 18 mining sites (64\%) and collected enough prey remains
   in 11 mining sites. A total of 732 minimum number of prey were
   identified. The diet of the Eagle Owl consisted mainly of mammals (83\%)
   and the proportion of birds in the diet was low (13\%). There was no
   relationship between the presence of Eagle Owls and the density of
   rabbits in the mining sites, but there was a positive relationship with
   the density of cliff-nesting birds. We conclude that the Eagle Owl does
   not seem to exert significant pressure on the cliff-nesting birds, even
   on wild pigeons, the most abundant cliff-nesting birds in its diet.
   Restoration projects which promote cliff-nesting birds would not entail
   a significant risk of generating ecological traps by excess of predation
   by the Eagle Owl. Furthermore, this species could be favored in
   restoration plans, as it is a threatened species in some areas in
   Europe.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution begins by attempting to specify the corona crisis'
   essence and form by means of acceleration theory. In so doing, the
   diagnosis of a politically induced, objectively measurable deceleration
   is pivotal. In a second step, the social theoretical conclusions from
   this diagnosis are drawn in contrast to system theory on the one hand,
   and neomarxist approaches on the other. The focus is on the argument
   that the political reaction to SARS-CoV-2 can neither be explained by
   reference to the principles of functional differentiation nor through
   the logic of securing political power or through capital accumulation.
   Following this line of thought, the article maps out the possibilities
   created by the crisis for societal path and system change, and outlines
   the role that sociology as a scientific discipline can and should play

Abstract = {{High-energy-density (HED) experiments in convergent geometry are able to
   test physical models at pressures beyond hundreds of millions of
   atmospheres. The measurements from these experiments are generally
   highly integrated and require unique analysis techniques to procure
   quantitative information. This work describes a methodology to constrain
   the physics in convergent HED experiments by adapting the methods common
   to many other fields of physics. As an example, a mechanical model of an
   imploding shell is constrained by data from a thin-shelled direct-drive
   exploding-pusher experiment on the OMEGA laser system using Bayesian
   inference, resulting in the reconstruction of the shell dynamics and
   energy transfer during the implosion. The model is tested by analyzing
   synthetic data from a one-dimensional hydrodynamics code and is sampled
   using a Markov chain Monte Carlo to generate the posterior distributions
   of the model parameters. The goal of this work is to demonstrate a
   general methodology that can be used to draw conclusions from a wide
   variety of HED experiments.}},

Title = {{Estimating time to reinjury among Washington State injured workers by
   degree of permanent impairment: Using state wage data to adjust for time
   at risk}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{13-25}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background Many injured workers are reinjured, but reinjury risk is
   challenging to quantify. Because many injured workers face delayed
   return-to-work, or return to part-time or intermittent jobs, a calendar
   timescale may overestimate actual work-time at risk, yielding
   underestimated reinjury rates. Objectives included determining: (1)
   reinjury risk by degree of permanent impairment and other factors, and
   (2) how choice of timescale affects reinjury estimates.
   Methods This retrospective cohort study included Washington State
   workers' compensation (WC) claims for 43,114 injured workers, linked to
   state wage files (2003-2018). Three timescales were used to define
   at-risk denominators: (1) calendar quarters; (2) quarters with any
   wages; and (3) full-time equivalent (FTE) quarters, defined as
   cumulative work hours divided by 520. Associations between reinjury
   outcomes and worker, injury, job, and WC vocational rehabilitation
   program participation characteristics were assessed using Cox
   proportional hazards regression.
   Results Overall reinjury rates were 5.9 per 100 worker-years using a
   calendar timescale (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 5.8-6.0), 10.0
   using any-wage quarters (95\% CI: 9.9-10.2), and 12.5 using FTE quarters
   (95\% CI: 12.3-12.7). Reinjury rates were highest in the first two
   quarters after initial injury, remaining elevated for about 4 years.
   Using FTE quarters, workers with >= 10\% whole body impairment had a
   34\% higher risk of reinjury relative to workers with no permanent
   partial disability award (95\% CI: 1.25-1.44); no difference was
   detected using calendar time.
   Conclusions Timescale substantially affects reinjury estimates and
   comparisons between groups with differential return-to-work patterns.
   Linking wage data to WC claims facilitates measurement of long-term
   employment, yielding more accurate reinjury estimates.}},

Title = {{How social media influences resident participation in rural tourism
   development: a case study of Tunda in Tibet}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TOURISM AND CULTURAL CHANGE}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have explored the impact of social media as a marketing
   tool on tourists' decision-making and experience, but few studies have
   explored the impact of social media on rural residents' tourism
   participation. Taking Tunda in Tibet as an example, this study
   qualitatively explores how social media embedding affects rural
   residents' tourism participation. Results show that social media
   reshapes villagers' social identity, social structure, and social
   relationship of the tourism community. Specifically, (1) the virtual
   space constructed by social media is connected with the lived space of
   villagers, additionally, the social and power relations in lived space
   are reshaped by the embedding of virtual space. (2) The production of
   virtual space with social media as the medium expands the resistance
   channels of representations of space in the process of space production
   in reality for villagers. Internal place branding can play a greater
   role in the place branding due to the embedding of social media. (3)
   When social media influences villagers' participation in tourism
   development, it influences changes in the community, including changing
   the villagers' lifestyle, strengthening informal power, and reshaping
   the social relationship of residents. The findings can help rural
   tourism destination managers adapt to changes in rural society brought
   about by social media.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen peroxide is a widely used industrial oxidant, the large-scale
   production of which continues to be done by an indirect process. Direct
   electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide from aerial oxygen and water is a
   sustainable alternative, but this remains challenging because hydrogen
   peroxide is highly reactive and robust catalysts are vital. Here, we
   report direct and continuous electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide under
   alkaline conditions using a nitrogen-doped-carbon-supported nickel
   catalyst. Both experiment and theoretical calculations confirm that the
   existence of nickel particles suppresses the further reduction of
   hydrogen peroxide on Ni-N-C matrix. In air-saturated 0.1 M potassium
   hydroxide, the energy-efficient non-precious metal electrocatalyst
   exhibits a consistent Faraday efficiency over 95\% at a steady rate of
   hydrogen peroxide production (15.1 mmol min(-1) gcat(-1)) for 100 h.
   This sustainable, efficient, and safe process is an important step
   toward continuous production of hydrogen peroxide.}},

   childhood trauma, the study investigated if and to what extent each
   spouse's trauma symptoms and relationship satisfaction were contributed

   dysphoric mood and posttraumatic stress were contributed exclusively by
   the trauma experience of self, symptoms in sexual difficulties
   exclusively by partner trauma experiences, while symptoms in
   self-dysfunction were contributed by both. Childhood trauma experiences
   had only a limited contribution to relationship satisfaction. Gender
   differences in the dual-trauma context are highlighted. Clinical

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an alternative current alpha plane protection for
   shunt reactors, which is able to identify internal faults, including
   turn-to-turn faults. The proposed algorithm is based only on zero
   sequence and neutral currents, eliminating the need for voltage
   measurements. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is based on an
   alternative current alpha plane, where the restraint characteristic is
   defined simply as its left half-plane, in such a way that minimal
   settings are required. In order to evaluate the performance of the
   proposed algorithm, the Alternative Transients Program was used to
   simulate different internal faults into an air-core dry-type shunt
   reactor connected to a 230 kV/60 Hz transmission line. The proposed
   algorithm performance was compared with the restricted earth fault
   function. From the obtained results, it is demonstrated that the
   proposed protection properly operates in turn-to-ground and turn-to-turn
   faults with operation times shorter than one power cycle, even for 1\%
   of short-circuited turns. On the other hand, restricted earth fault
   function failed to operate in some of these cases. The proposed
   algorithm ensured the integrity of the air-core dry-type shunt reactors
   in all evaluated scenarios, correctly restraining in all simulated
   external faults (including cases with current transformer saturation).
   Thus, the proposed algorithm is considered a reliable and promising
   alternative for shunt reactors protection.}},

Title = {{Impact of non-CNS childhood cancer on resting-state connectivity and its
   association with cognition}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction Non-central nervous system cancer in childhood (non-CNS CC)
   and its treatments pose a major threat to brain development, with
   implications for functional networks. Structural and functional
   alterations might underlie the cognitive late-effects identified in
   survivors of non-CNS CC. The present study evaluated resting-state
   functional networks and their associations with cognition in a mixed
   sample of non-CNS CC survivors (i.e., leukemia, lymphoma, and other
   non-CNS solid tumors).
   Methods Forty-three patients (off-therapy for at least 1 year and aged
   7-16 years) were compared with 43 healthy controls matched for age and
   sex. High-resolution T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance and
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were acquired.
   Executive functions, attention, processing speed, and memory were
   assessed outside the scanner.
   Results Cognitive performance was within the normal range for both
   groups; however, patients after CNS-directed therapy showed lower
   executive functions than controls. Seed-based connectivity analyses
   revealed that patients exhibited stronger functional connectivity
   between fronto- and temporo-parietal pathways and weaker connectivity
   between parietal-cerebellar and temporal-occipital pathways in the right
   hemisphere than controls. Functional hyperconnectivity was related to
   weaker memory performance in the patients' group.
   Conclusion These data suggest that even in the absence of brain tumors,
   non-CNS CC and its treatment can lead to persistent cerebral alterations
   in resting-state network connectivity.}},

Title = {{Equality in the Home and in the Community: a Multilevel Longitudinal
   Analysis of Intimate Partner Violence on the Ecuadorian-Colombian Border}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FAMILY VIOLENCE}},
Abstract = {{Intimate partner violence (IPV) effects over a third of Latin American
   women and results in significant health, economic and social
   consequences. While theory suggests that increasing the status of women,
   in their homes and neighborhoods, should prevent IPV, little empirical
   work has tested this in South America, in particular examining
   neighborhood-level indicators. We conduct multilevel analysis to
   identify predictors of recent emotional and physical and/or sexual IPV
   within a longitudinal sample of 1312 low-income women living in northern
   Ecuador, near the Colombian border. Status indicators, measured at the
   household and neighborhood-level, included women's asset ownership,
   intra-household decision making, labor force participation, and
   education, age, and salary relative to male partner. Females' increasing
   participation in household decision-making (between time 1 and time 2)
   was associated with decreased risk of physical and/or sexual (AOR: 0.41,
   95\% CI: 0.21, 0.78) and emotional IPV (AOR: 0.57, 95\% CI: 0.30, 1.06),
   although the latter was marginally significant. Increases in
   neighborhood-level decision-making was protective against emotional IPV
   (AOR: 0.78, 95\% CI: 0.61, 0.99). Women with lower education than their
   partners were significantly more likely to experience IPV than women
   with the same or more education as their partner. Indicators of economic
   status of women were not associated with IPV outcomes in the expected
   directions. Findings support policies and interventions seeking to raise
   the status of women as a mechanism to reduce IPV. Future research can
   explore economic empowerment and IPV, as well as the interaction between
   household and neighborhood-level factors.}},

   plasma (PRP) injections are effective in the management of adhesive
   capsulitis of the shoulder (AC). A triple-blind, randomized controlled
   trial was designed and conducted in a medical school hospital. Methods
   32 adult patients with adhesive capsulitis (21 female, 11 male with a
   mean age of 57, ranging from 23 to 70) were included in this study.
   Patients had to have shoulder pain and restrictions in movements (at
   least 25\% when compared to the other side, and at least in two
   directions) for three months minimum and nine months maximum. Patients
   were randomized to two groups, and one group took PRP injections for
   three times every two weeks, while the other group took saline
   injections in same frequency and volume. A standardized exercise program
   was also applied to all patients. Patients were evaluated with Shoulder
   Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), Visual Analogue Scales for pain and
   disability, ranges of movements, and use of analgesics in before, after,
   and third month after the initiation of the therapy. Results Baseline
   comparisons between groups showed no differences. SPADI and ranges of
   motion in all directions showed significant improvements with therapy,
   and the group which took PRP injections showed better improvements when
   compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Visual Analogue Scale was
   found to be better for the PRP group after therapy and third month, and
   not for the control group (0.4 +/- 1.06 and 0.17 +/- 0.72 vs. 2.5 +/-
   2.6 and 2 +/- 2.2, respectively, p < 0.05). Use of analgesics was not
   found to be significant for both groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion PRP
   injections were found to be effective in both pain and disability, and
   showed improvements in a restricted shoulder due to adhesive capsulitis.
   These findings might point out PRP as a therapeutic option in the
   management of adhesive capsulitis.}},

Number = {{2, SI}},

Abstract = {{It is within and through the body that we experience the physical,
   social, and emotional dimensions of life. This view draws on the
   existential phenomenological principal of embodiment, as described by
   French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Empathy is considered
   essential in the social work professional encounter. Prevailing
   conceptualisations of empathy in social work rely on simulation theory,
   where the social worker is expected to emulate the internal emotional
   and mental state of the client. Phenomenologists question the
   ontological plausibility of this conceptualisation. Their principal
   critiques are of mirroring, perspective-taking, and the associated
   emotional and intellectual labour. Expanding on phenomenological
   research, we suggest an alternate conceptualisation of empathy that
   integrates embodiment in social work theory, education, and practice. An
   embodied approach entails an interpretivist lens of subjectivity, direct
   perception of another's emotional state, sensitively and bodily
   attending to narrative, and adopting a compassionate stance of both
   ``understanding and not understanding{''}.
   IMPLICATIONS
   Empathy is an emotion-driven construct. Current views of empathy in
   social work rely on mentally simulating clients' emotions.
   Emotions are embodied in that they are physically felt and expressed.
   The body is therefore a powerful instrument for better understanding and
   empathising with clients.
   Future conceptualisations of empathy used in social work theory,
   education, and practice would benefit from taking an embodied approach.}},

Abstract = {{Advancements in manufacturing technology, including the rapid
   development of additive manufacturing (AM), allow the fabrication of
   complex functionally graded material (FGM) sectioned beams. Portions of
   these beams may be made from different materials with possibly different
   gradients of material properties. The present work proposes models to
   investigate the free vibration of FGM sectioned beams based on
   one-dimensional (1D) finite element analysis. For this purpose, a sample
   beam is divided into discrete elements, and the total energy stored in
   each element during vibration is computed by considering either
   Timoshenko or Euler-Bernoulli beam theories. Then, Hamilton's principle
   is used to derive the equations of motion for the beam. The effects of
   material properties and dimensions of FGM sections on the beam's natural
   frequencies and their corresponding mode shapes are then investigated
   based on a dynamic Timoshenko model (TM). The presented model is
   validated by comparison with three-dimensional (3D) finite element
   simulations of the first three mode shapes of the beam.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the role of disorder on the various topological magnonic
   phases present in deformed honeycomb ferromagnets. To this end, we
   introduce a bosonic Bott index to characterize the topology of magnon
   spectra in finite, disordered systems. The consistency between the Bott
   index and Chern number is numerically established in the clean limit. We
   demonstrate that topologically protected magnon edge states arc robust
   to moderate disorder and, as anticipated, localized in the strong
   regime. We predict a disorder-driven topological phase transition, a
   magnonic analog of the ``topological Anderson insulator{''} in
   electronic systems, where the disorder is responsible for the emergence
   of the nontrivial topology. Combining the results for the Bott index and
   transport properties, we show that bulk-boundary correspondence holds
   for disordered topological magnons. Our results open the door for
   research on topological magnonics as well as other bosonic excitations
   in finite and disordered systems.}},

Abstract = {{Background The current computational methods on identifying conserved
   protein complexes across multiple Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI)
   networks suffer from the lack of explicit modeling of the desired
   topological properties within conserved protein complexes as well as
   their scalability. Results To overcome those issues, we propose a
   scalable algorithm-ClusterM-for identifying conserved protein complexes
   across multiple PPI networks through the integration of network topology
   and protein sequence similarity information. ClusterM overcomes the
   computational barrier that existed in previous methods, where the
   complexity escalates exponentially when handling an increasing number of
   PPI networks; and it is able to detect conserved protein complexes with
   both topological separability and cohesive protein sequence
   conservation. On two independent compendiums of PPI networks from
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sce, yeast), Drosophila melanogaster (Dme,
   fruit fly), Caenorhabditis elegans (Cel, worm), and Homo sapiens (Hsa,
   human), we demonstrate that ClusterM outperforms other state-of-the-art
   algorithms by a significant margin and is able to identify de novo
   conserved protein complexes across four species that are missed by
   existing algorithms. Conclusions ClusterM can better capture the desired
   topological property of a typical conserved protein complex, which is
   densely connected within the complex while being well-separated from the
   rest of the networks. Furthermore, our experiments have shown that
   ClusterM is highly scalable and efficient when analyzing multiple PPI
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid advances in functional optoelectronics, the research on
   carbon-based materials and devices has become increasingly important at
   the terahertz frequency range owing to their advantages in terms of

   effective material and device design for a terahertz plasmonic
   metasurface sensor (PMS) based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNT
   metasurfaces based on silicon wafers have been prepared and obvious
   resonant transmission peaks are observed experimentally. The enhanced
   resonant peaks of transmission spectra are attributed to the surface
   plasmon polariton resonance, and the transmission peaks are further well
   explained by the Fano model. Furthermore, the different concentration
   gradients of pesticides (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic and chlorpyrifos
   solutions) have been detected by the designed PMSs, showing the lowest
   detection mass of 10 ng and the sensitivities of 1.38 X 10(-2)/ppm and
   2.0 x 10(-3)/ppm, respectively. Good linear relationships between
   transmission amplitude and pesticide concentration and acceptable

Abstract = {{Purpose An influential covariate for pharmacokinetics is (body) size.
   Recently, the method of estimation of normal fat mass (NFM) has been
   advocated. Here, the relative contribution of fat mass, estimated as a
   fraction fat (Ffat), is used to explain differences in pharmacokinetic
   parameters. This concept is more and more applied. However, it remains
   unclear whether NFM can be reliably estimated in these typical studies.
   Methods We performed an evaluation of the reliability of NFM estimation
   in a typical study size (n = 30), otherwise best-case scenario, by means
   of a pharmacokinetic simulation study. Several values of Ffat were
   investigated. Results In a typical pharmacokinetic study, high
   imprecision was observed for NFM parameter estimates over a range of
   scenarios. For example, in a scenario where the true value of Ffat on
   clearance was 0.5, we found a 95\% confidence interval of - 0.1 to 2.1,
   demonstrating a low precision. The implications for practice are that
   one could conclude that fat-free mass best describes the relationship of
   the pharmacokinetics with body size, while the true relationship was
   between fat-free mass and total body weight. Consequently, this could
   lead to incorrect extrapolation of pharmacokinetics to extreme body
   sizes. Conclusion In typical pharmacokinetic studies, NFM should be used
   with caution because the Ffat estimates have low precision. The
   estimation of Ffat should always be preceded by careful study design
   evaluation before planning a study, to ensure that the design and sample
   size is sufficient to apply this potentially useful methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed analyses of B cells in the tumour microenvironment of human
   papilloma virus (HPV)-linked head and neck cancers reveal strong humoral
   immune responses to HPV antigens and the secretion of HPV-specific
   antibodies in situ.
   Tumours often contain B cells and plasma cells but the antigen
   specificity of these intratumoral B cells is not well understood(1-8).
   Here we show that human papillomavirus (HPV)-specific B cell responses
   are detectable in samples from patients with HPV-positive head and neck
   cancers, with active production of HPV-specific IgG antibodies in situ.
   HPV-specific antibody secreting cells (ASCs) were present in the tumour
   microenvironment, with minimal bystander recruitment of
   influenza-specific cells, suggesting a localized and antigen-specific
   ASC response. HPV-specific ASC responses correlated with titres of
   plasma IgG and were directed against the HPV proteins E2, E6 and E7,
   with the most dominant response against E2. Using intratumoral B cells
   and plasma cells, we generated several HPV-specific human monoclonal
   antibodies, which exhibited a high degree of somatic hypermutation,
   consistent with chronic antigen exposure. Single-cell RNA sequencing
   analyses detected activated B cells, germinal centre B cells and ASCs
   within the tumour microenvironment. Compared with the tumour parenchyma,
   B cells and ASCs were preferentially localized in the tumour stroma,
   with well-formed clusters of activated B cells indicating ongoing
   germinal centre reactions. Overall, we show that antigen-specific
   activated and germinal centre B cells as well as plasma cells can be
   found in the tumour microenvironment. Our findings provide a better
   understanding of humoral immune responses in human cancer and suggest
   that tumour-infiltrating B cells could be harnessed for the development
   of therapeutic agents.}},

Title = {{Aesthetic and technical strategies for networked music performance}},
Journal = {{AI \& SOCIETY}},
Abstract = {{Networked music is no longer a future genre: the global quarantine event
   of 2020 launched the concept of performing together over the Internet
   into the mainstream. While the demand for performing at a distance may
   be a new imperative, musicians find themselves faced with technological
   and performative processes that do not appear to be suitable for
   performing music together online, due particularly to network latency
   which disrupts the ability for musicians to synchronize. The research
   presented in this paper investigates and challenges the reasons why
   networked music is not readily embraced by musicians and describes how
   that might change, by way of interviews with practitioners and an
   in-depth review of the technical constraints. Limitations that might
   cause frustration are in fact shown to have creative strategies that
   give rise to aesthetic approaches, distinct to the platform. By
   exploiting the constraints, in tandem with developing technology
   designed specifically for remote performance, aesthetic implications
   arise that not only accommodate the inconveniences of latency and
   acoustic feedback but can help us adapt and transform how we engage in
   real-time online, towards a future where we can imagine performing
   together over even more dramatic distances such as high-latency,
   low-bandwidth locations outside of urban areas-or even over galactic
   distances.}},

Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we extend the pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann model
   proposed by Huang and Wu {[}J. Comput. Phys. 327, 121 (2016)] to a
   three-dimensional model for practical simulations of multiphase flows
   with high density ratio. In this model, an additional source term is
   introduced into the evolution function, and the performed high-order
   Chapman-Enskog analysis demonstrates that the Navier-Stokes equations
   with accurate pressure tensor are recovered. Also, an alternative
   geometric formulation is developed to obtain various contact angles and
   an iteration scheme is involved in the initialization to improve the
   stability of the model. Theoretical and numerical investigations both
   validate that the thermodynamic consistency and tuning surface tension
   independently of density ratio is achieved through varying the two free
   parameters in the source term. Numerical simulations of droplet wetting
   indicate that a large degree range of contact angles can be precisely
   realized with the implementation of the wetting boundary scheme. Further
   dynamic examinations of droplet impingement on a thin film and a dry
   surface also verify the stability and capability of the proposed
   pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann model.}},

Abstract = {{Background Several recent studies suggest that serum anti-p53 antibodies
   (s-p53-Abs) may be combined with other markers to detect esophageal and
   colorectal cancer. In this study, we assessed the sensitivity and
   specificity of s-p53-Abs detection of a new electrochemiluminescence
   immunoassay (ECLIA; Elecsys anti-p53). Methods Elecsys anti-p53 assay
   was used to analyze the level of s-p53-Abs in blood sera from patients
   with esophageal or colorectal cancer taken before treatment. Control
   blood sera from healthy volunteers, patients with benign diseases, and
   patients with autoimmune diseases served as a reference. In addition,
   squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) and cytokeratin 19 fragments
   (CYFRA21-1) were assessed in patients with esophageal cancer, and
   carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 were
   assessed in patients with colorectal cancer. Results Samples from 281
   patients with esophageal cancer, 232 patients with colorectal cancer,
   and 532 controls were included in the study. The median value of
   s-p53-Abs in control samples was < 0.02 mu g/mL (range < 0.02-29.2 mu
   g/mL). Assuming 98\% specificity, the cut-off value was determined as
   0.05 mu g/mL. s-p53-Abs were detected in 20\% (57/281) of patients with
   esophageal cancer and 18\% (42/232) of patients with colorectal cancer.
   In combination with SCC-Ag and CEA, respectively, s-p53-Abs detected
   51\% (144/281) of patients with esophageal and 53\% (124/232) of
   patients with colorectal cancer. Conclusions The new s-p53-Abs assay
   Elecsys anti-p53 was useful in detecting esophageal and colorectal
   cancers with high specificity. Adding s-p53-Abs to conventional markers
   significantly improved the overall detection rates.}},

   Feedback Control}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an adaptive, simple, and effective guidance approach
   for hypersonic entry vehicles with high lift-to-drag (L/D) ratios (e.g.,
   hypersonic gliding vehicles). The core of the constrained guidance
   approach is a closed-form, easily obtained, and computationally
   efficient feedback control law that yields the analytic bank command
   based on the well-known quasi-equilibrium glide condition (QEGC). The
   magnitude of the bank angle command consists of two parts, i.e., the
   baseline part and the augmented part, which are calculated analytically
   and successively. The baseline command is derived from the analytic
   relation between the range-to-go and the velocity to guarantee the range
   requirement. Then, the bank angle is augmented with the predictive
   altitude-rate feedback compensations that are represented by an analytic
   set of flight path angle needed for the terminal constraints. The
   inequality path constraints in the velocity-altitude space are
   translated into the velocity-dependent bounds for the magnitude of the
   bank angle based on the QEGC. The sign of the bank command is also
   analytically determined using an automated bank-reversal logic based on
   the dynamic adjustment criteria. Finally, a feasible
   three-degree-of-freedom (3DOF) entry flight trajectory is simultaneously
   generated by integrating with the real-time updated command. Because no
   iterations and no or few off-line parameter adjustments are required
   using almost all analytic processing, the algorithm provides remarkable
   simplicity, rapidity, and adaptability. A considerable range of entry
   flights using the vehicle data of the CAV-H is tested. Simulation
   results demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the presented
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Central to the present paper is the question of how designers can be
   supported to deliberately facilitate positive emotional experiences.
   Related to this, the paper provides an overview of the research on
   design for positive emotions, its issues, and opportunities for further
   investigations. The practical relevance of transcending the notion of
   generalised pleasure is discussed, highlighting the benefits of
   developing and applying a nuanced understanding of positive emotions.
   Overarching challenges and opportunities that underlie in stimulating
   such understanding are delineated along with the review of
   characteristics of positive emotions. Ethical issues of designing for
   positive emotions are reflected regarding its implications for
   well-being with suggestions to resolve them. Besides, the paper
   discusses emerging research directions, ranging from design tools to
   distinguish diverse positive emotions, the added value of exploring
   expressive interaction qualities of positive emotions, to advantages of
   involving tool users (e.g., designers and project stakeholders) in the
   development process.}},

Abstract = {{While transcription factors (TFs) are known to regulate the expression
   of their target genes (TGs), only a weak correlation of expression
   between TFs and their TGs has generally been observed. As lack of
   correlation could be caused by additional layers of regulation, the
   overall correlation distribution may hide the presence of a subset of
   regulatory TF-TG pairs with tight expression coupling. Using reported
   regulatory pairs in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana along with
   comprehensive gene expression information and testing a wide array of
   molecular features, we aimed to discern the molecular determinants of
   high expression correlation of TFs and their TGs. TF-family assignment,
   stress-response process involvement, short genomic distances of the
   TF-binding sites to the transcription start site of their TGs, few
   required protein-protein-interaction connections to establish physical
   interactions between the TF and polymerase-II, unambiguous TF-binding
   motifs, increased numbers of miRNA target-sites in TF-mRNAs, and a young
   evolutionary age of TGs were found particularly indicative of high TF-TG
   correlation. The modulating roles of post-transcriptional,
   post-translational processes, and epigenetic factors have been
   characterized as well. Our study reveals that regulatory pairs with high
   expression coupling are associated with specific molecular determinants.}},

Abstract = {{In families with X-linked recessive diseases, foetal sex is determined
   prenatally by detection of Y-chromosomal sequences in cell-free foetal
   DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma. The same procedure is used to confirm
   the cffDNA presence during non-invasive prenatal RhD incompatibility
   testing but there are no generally accepted markers for the detection of
   cffDNA fraction in female-foetus bearing pregnancies. We present a
   methodology allowing the detection of paternal X-chromosomal alleles on
   maternal background and the confirmation of female sex of the foetus by
   positive amplification signals. Using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) we
   examined X-chromosomal INDEL (insertion/deletion) polymorphisms:
   rs2307932, rs16397, rs16637, rs3048996, rs16680 in buccal swabs of 50
   females to obtain the population data. For all INDELs, we determined the
   limits of detection for each ddPCR assay. We examined the cffDNA from 63
   pregnant women bearing Y-chromosome negative foetuses. The analysis with
   this set of INDELs led to informative results in 66.67\% of examined
   female-foetus bearing pregnancies. Although the population data
   predicted higher informativity (74\%) we provided the proof of principle
   of this methodology. We successfully applied this methodology in
   prenatal diagnostics in a family with Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome and in
   pregnancies tested for the risk of RhD incompatibility.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Blood transfusion is a cornerstone therapy for
   many patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), but ranges from few
   to no transfusions to intensive transfusion therapy. To date, no large
   studies have described transfusion use or costs for patients with MDS,
   accounting for the range of disease severity.
   Materials and methods A nationwide cohort study was conducted with all
   patients diagnosed with MDS in Sweden between 2008 and 2017, based on
   the Swedish MDS register and the Swedish part of the Scandinavian
   Donations and Transfusions Database 3 (SCANDAT3-S). Patients were
   followed from diagnosis until death, emigration, allogeneic
   hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or end of follow-up. Average
   cumulative transfusion count and costs over time were calculated,
   stratified by the revised international prognostic scoring system
   (IPSS-R) and age at diagnosis. Costs calculations used data on incident
   transfusions and laboratory testing and were divided into: direct
   material costs, direct labour costs and laboratory costs.
   Results In total, 2311 patients were included in the cohort. In the
   first four years after diagnosis, patients in the very low IPSS-R
   category received on average 25 red cell (95\% confidence interval,
   20-32) and 4 (3-7) platelet transfusions. Conversely, patients in the
   very high-risk category received on average 171 (135-200) red cell and
   66 (51-78) platelet transfusions. Correspondingly, transfusion costs
   ranged from \$8805 (\$6482-\$11 625) to \$80 106 (\$61 460-\$95 792).
   Conclusion Transfusion count and costs for patients with MDS increased
   markedly with IPSS-R risk category, but were similar across age groups.
   Transfusion costs were considerable for the highest IPSS-R risk
   categories.}},

Abstract = {{G-quadruplex (G4) structures formed by guanine-rich nucleic acids are
   implicated in essential physiological and pathological processes and
   serve as important drug targets. The genome-wide detection of G4s in
   living cells is important for exploring the functional role of G4s but
   has not yet been achieved due to the lack of a suitable G4 probe. Here
   we report an artificial 6.7 kDa G4 probe (G4P) protein that binds G4s
   with high affinity and specificity. We used it to capture G4s in living
   human, mouse, and chicken cells with the ChIP-Seq technique, yielding
   genome-wide landscape as well as details on the positions, frequencies,
   and sequence identities of G4 formation in these cells. Our results
   indicate that transcription is accompanied by a robust formation of G4s
   in genes. In human cells, we detected up to >123 000 G4P peaks, of which
   >1/3 had a fold increase of >= 5 and were present in >60\% promoters and
   similar to 70\% genes. Being much smaller than a scFv antibody (27 kDa)
   or even a nanobody (12-15 kDa), we expect that the G4P may find diverse
   applications in biology, medicine, and molecular devices as a G4
   affinity agent.}},

Abstract = {{Daytime radiative cooling is a passive strategy to cool down a
   terrestrial object under direct sunlight without the need of electricity
   input. It functions by simultaneously reflecting solar irradiance and
   sending heat as infrared (IR) thermal radiation through the atmospheric
   transparent window into the cold outer space. In spite of extensive
   studies on daytime radiative cooling, most of previous works were
   conducted in dry regions mainly in North America. Here, we explore the
   feasibility of achieving efficient radiative cooling in humid
   subtropical areas such as Hong Kong, where abundant atmosphere water
   vapor exists. In this case, the atmospheric transparent window is almost
   closed since water is highly absorptive of IR radiation. We report a
   simple approach to achieve efficient daytime radiative cooling in Hong
   Kong. Our design comprises an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)
   film and a Ag layer deposited on a transparent glass substrate. We show
   that the combination of highly diffusely reflective ePTFE and all-band
   reflective Ag results in a reflectivity of 98\% in the solar spectrum,
   allowing for a temperature drop up to 2.7 degrees C under a solar
   intensity of 1000 W/m(2) on a humid day in Hong Kong.}},

Title = {{Effects of biochar and biofertilizer on cadmium-contaminated cotton
   growth and the antioxidative defense system}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Consistent use of large amounts of fertilizers, pesticides, and mulch
   can cause the accumulation of harmful substances in cotton plants. Among
   these harmful substances, cadmium (Cd), an undegradable element, stands
   out as being particularly highly toxic to plants. The objective of this
   study was to evaluate the ability of biochar (3\%) and biofertilizer
   (1.5\%) to decrease Cd uptake, increase cotton dry weight, and modulate
   the activities of photosynthetic and peroxidase (POD), superoxide
   dismutase (SOD), catalase enzyme (CAT) in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)
   grown in Cd-contaminated soil (0, 1, 2, or 4 mg Cd kg(-1) soil) in pots.
   These studies showed that, as expected, exogenous Cd adversely affects
   cotton chlorophyll and photosynthesis. However, biochar and
   biofertilizer increased cotton dry weight by an average of 16.82\% and
   32.62\%, respectively. Meanwhile, biochar and biofertilizer decreased
   the accumulation of Cd in cotton organs, and there was a significant
   reduction in the amount of Cd in bolls (P<0.05). Biochar and
   biofertilizer have a positive impact on cotton chlorophyll content, net
   photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and
   intercellular CO2 concentration. Thus, the addition of biochar and
   biofertilizer promote cotton growth. However, biochar and biofertilizer
   increased the SOD activity of leaves (47.70\% and 77.21\%), CAT activity
   of leaves (35.40\% and 72.82\%), SOD activity of roots (33.62\% and
   39.37\%), and CAT activity of roots (36.91\% and 60.29\%), respectively,
   and the addition of biochar and biofertilizer decreased the content of
   MDA and electrolyte leakage rate. Redundancy analyses showed that
   biochar and biofertilizer also improved SOD and POD activities by
   reducing the heavy metal-induced oxidative stress in cotton and reducing
   Cd uptake in cotton organs. Therefore, biochar and biofertilizer have a
   positive effect on the growth of cotton.}},

Abstract = {{Osteosarcoma (OS), a prevalent aggressive malignancy in the bone, has
   limited therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers. In the current
   investigation, RT-qPCR showed that CDKN2B-AS1 was enhanced in OS samples

   in OS. The expression of CDKN2B-AS1 and downstream molecules was
   analyzed by RT-qPCR method. CCK8, EdU staining along with Transwell
   assays were applied to evaluate cell proliferation and invasion. Those
   in vitro investigations specified that silencing of CDKN2B-AS1 with
   shRNAs obviously impeded the proliferation and invasion of MG63 cells.
   To authenticate the relationships between CDKN2B-AS1 and microRNA-122-5p

Title = {{Distinguishing High-Performing Health Systems Using a Composite of
   Publicly Reported Measures of Ambulatory Care}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{173}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{791+}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Payers and policymakers are rewarding high-performing health
   care providers on the basis of summaries of overall quality performance,
   and the methods they use for measuring performance are increasingly
   important.
   Objective: To develop and evaluate a measure that ranks health care
   systems by ambulatory care quality.
   Design: Systems were ranked using a composite model that summarizes
   individual measures of quality, accounts for their correlation, and does
   not require health care systems to report every measure. The composite
   measure's suitability was evaluated by examining whether it captured the
   quality indicated by component measures (validity), whether differences
   in rank between health care systems were larger than statistical noise
   (reliability), and whether year-to-year changes in rank were small
   (stability).
   Setting: California and Minnesota, 2014 to 2016. Participants: 55 health
   care systems.
   Measurements: Publicly reported measures of ambulatory care quality.
   Results: The composite measure was valid in that it was broadly
   representative of the component measures and was not dominated by any
   single measure. The measure was reliable because the ranks for 93\% of
   California systems and 80\% of Minnesota systems were unlikely to be
   more than 2 places lower or higher. The measure was stable because fewer
   than half of systems changed ranks by more than 2 ranks from year to
   year.
   Limitation: The analysis is limited to available measures of ambulatory
   care quality and includes only 2 states.
   Conclusion: This composite measure uses publicly reported data to
   produce valid, reliable, and stable ranks of ambulatory care quality for
   health care systems in Minnesota and California, and this approach could
   be used in other applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the multiobjective minimum cost flow (F-MOMCF)

Abstract = {{Localisation is one of the most important services in sensor networks.
   The impact of the used localisation technique used reflects on wireless
   sensor network services such as coverage or event detection. Accuracy is
   considered to be one of the factors that is related to successful

   ranging is one of the practical applicable technique for localisation on

   study proposes an enhanced communication ranging localisation technique
   with high accuracy. The authors evaluated and validated the proposed
   technique in a forest environment using 20 Waspmote Nodes and Meshlium
   router (Spanish product). The novelty of the proposed localisation
   technique is based on controlling communication range by manipulating
   the XBee transmitter power changing ability on four rounds to provide
   the best-predicted location. The results demonstrated the locations of
   nodes were found with error range between 0 and 22 m. The network
   location error decreased starting with 30 m in round 1 down to 8 m in
   round 4. The technique can be applied to different types of networks and
   technologies as long as the transmission power can be set to different
   values and the communication range is known or can be measured manually.}},

Abstract = {{OCCUPATIONAL APPLICATIONS
   We found, contrary to expectations, that performing a fatiguing
   simulated heavy manual material handling (MMH) task did not adversely
   affect the risk of trip-induced falls when compared to a less-fatiguing
   light MMH task. However, when considering these MMH tasks together
   rather than in comparison, our results provide evidence for adverse
   effects of fatigue on both gait and the ability to recover balance after
   tripping. The current results provide additional evidence that physical
   fatigue increases fall risk, start to clarify the mechanisms by which
   this increase occurs, and can help in developing and evaluating fall
   prevention strategies targeting these mechanisms.
   TECHNICAL ABSTRACT
   Background: Falls are a leading cause of occupational injuries, and the
   incidence of occupational falls may be exacerbated by physical fatigue
   resulting from physically-demanding work. Purpose: The goal of this
   study was to evaluate the effects of occupationally-relevant physical
   fatigue on the risk of trip-induced falls. Methods: Thirty-six healthy
   young adults performed two-hours of a simulated heavy manual material
   handling (MMH) task (experimental group) or a light MMH task (control
   group). Risks of tripping and slipping were evaluated before and after
   completing the task, and one laboratory-induced trip while walking was
   induced after completing the MMH task. Results: Compared to the light
   MMH task, the heavy MMH task did not adversely affect the risk of
   tripping or slipping during gait, reactive balance after tripping, or
   fall rate after tripping. These results may have been due to an
   insufficient difference in fatigue level between groups. When both
   groups were considered together, however, the MMH tasks resulted in an
   unsteady gait, an increased risk of slipping while walking and carrying
   a load, and a fall rate that was substantially higher than reported in
   other studies. Conclusions: Although the effects of the heavy and light
   MMH tasks did not differ, changes in fall risk measures when considering
   both MMH tasks as one provide evidence for the biomechanical mechanisms
   by which physical fatigue may increase the risk of occupational falls.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper investigates a travelling fire scenario in an
   elongated structure (Length 18 m x width 6 m x height 3 m) with a
   controlled fire source of six trays filled with diesel (width 4 m x
   length 0.5 m). The fire spread is controlled manually by initiating
   fires consecutively in the pools. Fire dynamics simulator (FDS) is used
   to a-priori investigate variations in geometry, material data and fire
   load, whereas simulations using the final design and measured heat
   release rates (HRR) were performed after the test. The input to the
   model beside fire source and geometry are thermal material data. The FDS
   simulations were used to determine the appropriate size of the

Abstract = {{A survey of Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (SCYLV) was conducted in
   northern Argentina in 2015 and 2016 using tissue blot immunoassay
   (TBIA). Results showed plant infection rates of 2.2-86.7\% in sugarcane
   commercial fields from different growing areas. Percentage of infected
   leaves varied among cultivars and areas. NA 05-860 was the most infected
   cultivar (86.7\% incidence). Virus genotypic diversity of SCYLV positive
   samples was analysed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-PCR). The virus genotype BRA-PER was found in all samples, followed
   by genotypes REU and CUB (36\% and 8\% of positive samples,
   respectively). The following co-infection patterns were found: BRA-PER +
   REU (34\%); BRA-PER + CUB (6\%); and the three genotypes, BRA-PER + REU
   + CUB (2\%). Sugar content loss in cultivar LCP 85-384 infected with
   SCYLV was evaluated. Sugar yield reduction in SCYLV positive plants was
   statistically significant in dryland conditions (p < 0.0001). Our
   results indicate the high prevalence of SCYLV, the first detection of
   genotypes CUB and REU, and reduction in sucrose content related to SCYLV
   in Argentina. Disease management in the crop region should include the
   use of healthy planting material and SCYLV-tolerant cultivars.}},

Title = {{Impact of the FindMyApps program on people with mild cognitive

   randomised controlled trial}},
Journal = {{DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION-ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   FindMyApps is a web-based selection-tool and errorless learning training
   program to help people with mild dementia/Mild Cognitive Impairment
   (MCI) and caregivers find user-friendly apps. In preparation of a
   definitive trial, the impact and feasibility of the FindMyApps
   intervention on self-management and engagement in meaningful activities,
   including social participation, was explored.
   Materials and methods
   An exploratory pilot randomised controlled trial (trial registration
   approval number: NL7210) with pre/post measurements was conducted with
   community-dwelling people with mild dementia/MCI and their caregivers (n
   = 59) in the Netherlands. Dyads in the experimental group (n = 28)
   received training to use the tablet and FindMyApps, and the errorless
   learning method was taught to their caregivers. Control group dyads (n =
   31) received a tablet (without FindMyApps), instructions on tablet-use
   and links to dementia-friendly apps. Validated instruments were used to
   assess person with dementia's self-management, meaningful activities and
   social participation, caregiver's sense of competence and both their
   quality of life.
   Results and conclusions
   No statistical significant group differences on the outcomes were found.
   Small to moderate effect-sizes in favour of the FindMyApps group were
   found for self-management and social participation. Caregivers tended to
   have more positive care experiences. Subgroup analyses showed that
   people older than 70 benefitted more from FindMyApps regarding
   self-management and higher educated people benefitted more regarding
   social participation. FindMyApps is feasible for the target group and
   may have potential to improve self-management and social participation.
   For a future definitive effectiveness trial a larger sample size is
   recommended, as well as taking into account the possible impact of
   education and age.}},

Title = {{A visual attention system based anisotropic diffusion method for an
   effective textile defect detection}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE}},
Abstract = {{Recently, saliency maps are widely used as an image feature to improve
   results of segmentation or classification of defects. In this paper we
   tackle the problem of defect detection in fabric images. We propose a
   defect extraction method in textile images based on a modified
   anisotropic diffusion filter combined with a saliency image feature. The
   classical anisotropic diffusion models consider only the image gradient
   information of a diffused pixel. Consequently, they cannot identify
   defect edges confused with background texture. Since the defects in the
   neighborhood of the image generally have larger saliency intensity value
   than the background, the proposed diffusion model incorporates both
   local gradient magnitude and a modified saliency map. The aim is to
   preserve defect edges while effectively removing the textured
   background. Moreover a new diffusion function is proposed that permits
   to carry on adaptively a smoothing in faultless regions and a sharpening
   process at defect boundaries. To confirm the effectiveness of our
   algorithm, we compare tests and results with different methods on
   textile images including different kinds of defects and fabrics. Results
   show that our method outperforms the other considered algorithms and can
   accurately extracts defects.}},

Title = {{PTV-based p-type organic semiconductors: Candidates for low-cost
   photovoltaic donors with simple synthetic routes}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{209}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technique aims to realize roll-to-roll
   printing of semi-transparent, mechanically flexible and low-cost
   photovoltaic devices. The reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs),
   based on high performance light-harvesting materials, have been close to
   the requirement of practical application. However, scaling up and
   processability of the materials have become one of the main barriers
   inhibiting the OPV commercialization. In order to provide ideas for
   solving the cost issue, a series of low-cost p-type copolymers, PTV-X (X
   represents different alkyl side chains) with copolymerization of
   thienylene and vinylene as backbones, are prepared and characterized. It
   was demonstrated that PTV-based materials possess almost flat structure
   and broad absorption spectra range from 300 to 750 nm. Besides, the hole
   mobilities of the optimized materials are up to magnitude of 10(-4)
   cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Importantly, the PTV-X family polymers can work
   effectively with various representative fullerene and non-fullerene
   acceptors. A regioregular polymer, namely PTVT-C12, is synthesized based
   on monomers of (thiophene-vinylene-thiophene) TVT-C12 and V-Sn to
   further modulate the morphological properties of the PTV-series
   polymers. The more ordered chain packing was observed in PTVT-C12 film
   and enhanced charge carrier mobility was realized in PTVT-C12 based OSC
   device. As a result, a PCE of 6.44\% is exhibited by the device based on
   PTVT-C12: BO-4Cl. This study suggests that PTV-series materials are
   being worthy of consideration for the development of low-cost materials
   for the future OPV commercialization.}},

Abstract = {{Reports by professional organizations (e.g., AICPA, CPA Canada, and
   ICAEW) argue that blockchain adoption is likely to reduce the need for
   record-keeping tasks and shift the accounting focus to higher-level
   activities. To evaluate such expectations and form their own opinions,
   accounting professionals need to understand the way blockchain works in
   a business setting. The primary objective of this article is to provide
   the reader with the foundational knowledge needed to better understand
   reports such as those suggesting that blockchain will change the way
   auditors execute their engagements and generate new assurance
   opportunities for configuring policies in blockchain networks. Building
   on evidence indicating that the most promising use cases are from the
   logistics industry, we describe a blockchain implementation in a supply
   chain setting. Using a scaffolding approach, we start with a supply
   chain and describe how blockchain is implemented in one of its segments,
   before we show how a complete transaction is recorded on the ledger.}},

Abstract = {{Bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis is a livestock
   disease of global economic and public health importance. There are
   currently no effective vaccines available for livestock and so control
   relies on animal level surveillance and pasteurization of dairy
   products. A new alternative control approach is to exploit the genetic
   variability of the host; recent studies have demonstrated that breeding
   European taurine cattle, such as Holsteins for increased resistance to
   bTB is feasible. The utility of such an approach is still unknown for
   African cattle populations. This study aims to assess genetic variation
   in bTB resistance and the underlying genomic architecture of cattle in
   Cameroon. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 2,346 slaughter cattle
   in Cameroon. Retropharyngeal lymph node samples were collected and
   cultured on Lowenstein Jensen media and the BACTEC MGIT 960 system, and
   M. bovis was identified using the Hain (R) Genotype kits. A total of 153
   cattle were positive for M. bovis and were archived along with a random
   selection of negative samples. In this study, we genotyped archived
   samples from 212 cattle. Their genomic diversity was characterized using
   PCA, hierarchical clustering and admixture analysis. We assessed genetic
   variation in bTB resistance using heritability analysis and compared
   quantitative trait loci. Previous research on this study population have
   shown that Fulani cattle are more susceptible to bTB than mixed breeds.
   However, here we show that these apparent phenotypic differences in
   breeds are not reflected by clear genomic differences. At the genetic
   level, both the Fulani and mixed cattle show similar patterns of
   admixture with evidence of both taurine and indicine ancestry. There was
   little European taurine introgression within the studied population.
   Hierarchical clustering showed clusters of cattle that differed in their
   susceptibility to bTB. Our findings allude to bTB resistance being
   polygenic in nature. This study highlights the potential for genetic
   control of bTB in Africa and the need for further research into the
   genetics of bTB resistance within African cattle populations.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: With an increase in patient demand and a decrease in
   healthcare professionals, telehealth is able to provide needed services
   to patients, but appropriate training in telehealth is crucial for
   providers to deliver excellent patient care.
   Method: Nurse researchers developed a quality improvement project
   targeting telehealth in the graduate nursing curriculum. A two-part
   evidence-based curriculum was developed for graduate family nurse
   practitioner (FNP) students. Part one consisted of a lecture that
   focused on increasing students' knowledge, and part two enhanced skills
   through simulation.
   Results: Data were collected through qualitative and quantitative
   surveys. The qualitative data were analyzed for themes and statistical
   analysis of the quantitative data was completed (t-scores and
   descriptive statistics). Results showed that FNP students perceived the
   telehealth curriculum as educational and recommend it be continued for
   future FNP cohorts.
   Conclusion: Using evidence-based practice and telehealth experts
   graduate nursing programs should introduce the telehealth curriculum for
   FNP students through in class lecture and simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Despite the fact that the laparoscopic-assisted endorectal
   pull-through (LAEPT) for Hirschsprung's disease (HD) was introduced over
   20 years ago, published outcomes in older children and adolescent are
   lacking. To address this, we studied the long-term results of LATEP for
   rectosigmoid HD in patients above 5 years of age.
   Materials and Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on all
   nonsyndromic patients above 5 years of age and who underwent one-stage
   LAEPT for rectosigmoid HD between January 2002 and December 2017. Late
   Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) was defined as HAEC
   occurring 1 year after the pull-through operation. Postoperative bowel
   function was assessed using the Krickenbeck classification.
   Results: Forty-one patients (37 males and 4 females) were included in
   this study with a median follow-up of 9.0 years. The median age at
   surgery was 55 days. Two patients had anastomotic leakage. No patient
   had late HAEC, rectal prolapse, anastomotic stricture, or intestinal
   obstruction. According to the Krickenbeck classification, all patients
   had voluntary bowel movements without constipation. Overall, 65.8\% of
   patients had no soiling. However, on subgroup analysis, only 45.4\% of
   patients younger than 11 years of age had no soiling compared with
   89.5\% in patients at or older than 11 years of age (P = .003).
   Conclusions: Our results showed that LAEPT for rectosigmoid HD was a
   safe procedure. Nearly 90\% of patients had normal bowel function by
   puberty. Further studies are needed to address the problem of soiling in
   patients younger than 11 years of age.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Among the plethora of catalytic methods developed for
   hydrocarbofunctionalization of olefins to date, reactions that
   regioselectively install a functionalized alkyl unit at the 2-position
   of a terminal unactivated C=C bond to afford branched products are
   scarce. Here, we show that a Ni-based catalyst in conjunction with a
   stoichiometric reducing agent promote Markovnikov-selective
   hydroalkylation of unactivated alkenes tethered to a recyclable
   8-aminoquinaldine directing auxiliary. These mild reductive processes
   employ readily available primary and secondary haloalkanes as both the
   hydride and alkyl donor. Reactions of alkenyl amides with >= five-carbon
   chain length regioselectively afforded beta -alkylated products through
   remote hydroalkylation, underscoring the fidelity of the catalytic
   process and the directing group's capability in stabilizing
   five-membered nickelacycle intermediates. The operationally simple
   protocol exhibits exceptional functional group tolerance and is amenable
   to the synthesis of bioactive molecules as well as regioconvergent
   transformations. Methods that regioselectively install a functionalized
   alkyl unit at the 2-position of a terminal unactivated C=C bond are

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{This study evaluated changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) with
   face-down positioning (FDP) following surgical treatment of idiopathic
   macular hole. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 130 patients
   diagnosed with idiopathic macular hole who underwent pars plana
   vitrectomy (PPV) with intravitreal gas injection after fluid-gas
   exchange. We analyzed IOP changes in both eyes following FDP over the
   course of 7 days. The mean IOP of the operated eyes was 14.98 +/- 2.95
   mmHg preoperatively and 16.82 +/- 3.12 and 15.57 +/- 6.10 mmHg on
   postoperative days 2 and 7, respectively. In contralateral eyes, the
   mean IOP changed from 14.78 +/- 3.15 mmHg preoperatively to 16.27 +/-
   1.87 and 14.40 +/- 4.14 mmHg on postoperative days 2 and 7,
   respectively. On postoperative day 2, the IOP increased in both eyes
   compared to the preoperative values, but the increase was significant
   only in operated eyes (p = 0.039). In contralateral eyes, the IOP on
   postoperative day 7 was significantly decreased compared with that on
   postoperative day 2 (p = 0.021) and in eyes with an axial length >= 23.0
   mm, compared with the preoperative values (p = 0.042). The IOP of the
   operated eyes on postoperative day 7 was higher than that of the
   contralateral eyes (p = 0.039). Based on a short-term follow-up, FDP
   after PPV with intravitreal gas tamponade for the treatment of

Abstract = {{In this study, a new network architecture based on the software-defined
   networking (SDN) approach is proposed for cognitive radio networks
   (CRNs). The proposed network architecture {[}software-defined cognitive
   radio (SDCR)] assumes the responsibilities of network resource
   management for CRNs and provides a dynamic spectrum management mechanism
   with an SDN controller. In this way, the dependency of network users on
   base stations is reduced in dynamic cognitive radio environments, and
   network performance is improved by delegating some of the management
   responsibilities to the controller. The performance analysis of the SDCR
   is carried out through the RIVERBED MODELER simulation software.
   End-to-end delays and packet loss rates for the primary network are
   investigated by selecting different offered loads for secondary users.
   In addition, for the equal and different packet sizes, primary network
   and SDCR throughput are examined and network performance is improved by
   using channel bonding technique. The results indicate that the SDCR
   outperforms the traditional CRN architecture, in terms of the
   throughput, and the proposed architecture can provide effective
   performance. Bit error rate parameter is investigated in the study and
   the energy consumption parameter of the SDCR is also compared with the
   cognitive radio wireless network.}},

Abstract = {{The peripartum period is accompanied by numerous physiological and
   behavioural adaptations organised by the maternal brain. These changes
   are essential for adequate expression of maternal behaviour, thereby
   ensuring proper development of the offspring. The
   corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) plays a key role in a variety of
   behaviours accompanying stress, anxiety, and depression. There is also
   evidence that CRF contributes to maladaptations during the peripartum
   period. We investigated the effects of CRF in the bed nucleus of the
   stria terminalis (BNST) of lactating mice during maternal care and
   analysed locomotor activity and anxiety-like behaviour in the offspring.
   The BNST has been implicated in anxiety behaviour and regulation of the
   stress response. The effects of intra-BNST CRF administration were
   compared with those induced by the limited bedding (LB) procedure, a
   model that produces altered maternal behaviour. BALB/cJ dams were
   exposed to five infusions of CRF or saline into the BNST in the first
   weeks after birth while the LB dams were exposed to limited nesting
   material from postnatal days (P) 2-9. Maternal behaviour was recorded in
   intercalated days, from P1-9. Offspring anxiety-like behaviour was
   assessed during adulthood using the open-field, elevated plus-maze, and
   light/dark tests. Both intra-BNST CRF and LB exposure produced altered
   maternal care, represented by decreased arched-back nursing and
   increased frequency of exits from the nest. These changes in maternal
   care resulted in robust sex-based differences in the offspring's
   behavioural responses during adulthood. Females raised by CRF-infused
   dams exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviour, whereas males presented
   a significant decrease in anxiety. On the other hand, both males and
   females raised by dams exposed to LB showed higher locomotor activity.
   Our study demonstrates that maternal care is impaired by intra-BNST CRF
   administrations, and these maladaptations are similar to exposure to
   adverse early environments. These procedures, however, produce distinct
   phenotypes in mice during young adulthood and suggest sex-based
   differences in the susceptibility to poor maternal care.}},

Abstract = {{Northern Hemispheric high-latitude climate variations during the last
   glacial are expected to propagate globally in a complex way.
   Investigating the evolution of these variations requires a precise
   synchronization of the considered environmental archives. Align-ing the
   globally common production rate variations of the cosmogenic
   radionuclide Be-10 in different archives provides a tool for such
   synchronizations. Here, we present a Be-10 record at <40-y resolution
   along with subdecadal proxy records from one Black Sea sediment core
   around Greenland Interstadial 10 (GI-10) similar to 41 ka BP and the
   Laschamp geomagnetic excursion. We synchronized our Be-10 record to that
   from Greenland ice cores based on its globally common production rate
   variations. The synchronized environmental proxy records reveal a
   bipartite climate response in the Black Sea region at the onset of
   GI-10. First, in phase with Greenland warming, reduced sedimentary
   coastal ice rafted detritus contents indicate less severe winters.
   Second, and with a lag of 190 (+/- 44) y, an increase in the detrital
   K/Ti ratio and authigenic Ca precipitation point to enhanced regional
   precipitation and warmer lake surface temperatures. We explain the
   lagged climatic response by a shift in the dominant mode of atmospheric
   circulation, likely connected with a time-transgressive adjustment of
   the regional thermal ocean interior to interstadial conditions.}},

Title = {{Heterosexual University Students' Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Couples and
   Parents Across Seven European Countries}},
Journal = {{SEXUALITY RESEARCH AND SOCIAL POLICY}},
Abstract = {{Introduction This research examined the general attitudes toward lesbian
   women and gay men (LG people), same-sex marriage (SSM), and LG parenting
   (LGP) in a large sample of young heterosexual European adults. We
   expected that one's country of origin, gender role traditionalism,
   contact, and religiosity would predict their responses. Methods We
   conducted a large-scale study from April 2012 to November 2014. The
   sample consisted of 13,403 self-identified heterosexual students from
   Belgium, Italy, France, Portugal, Poland, Spain, and Greece (38.7\% men
   and 61.2\% women). The main research variables were general attitudes
   toward LG people, support for same-sex coupling and parenting, gender
   role traditionalism beliefs, frequency and quality of the contact with
   LG people, and religiosity. Results We found that the attitudes toward
   these issues were significantly more negative in Poland and less
   negative in Greece than in the other countries included in the sample.
   In addition, these national differences were explained by psychological
   variables, mainly religiosity and general attitudes toward LG people.
   Although participants' higher satisfaction levels regarding their
   contact with LG people and lower levels of gender role traditionalism
   were associated with positive attitudes toward SSM and parenting, these
   factors did not account for the attitudinal variability between these
   countries. Conclusions Attitudes toward LG people are changing
   throughout Europe and are influenced by each country's sociopolitical
   context. We highlight the societal importance of attitudes toward SSM
   and LG parenting and recommend facilitating positive social contact in
   universities and other settings to improve young adult heterosexuals'
   attitudes. Policy Implications This study's results can inform policies
   aiming to reduce inequality and develop more inclusive policies on
   same-sex parented families and couples.}},

Abstract = {{Endeavoring toward a transferable, predictive coarse-grained
   explicit-chain model for biomolecular condensates underlain by
   liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins, we conducted
   multiple-chain simulations of the N-terminal intrinsically disordered
   region (IDR) of DEAD-box helicase Ddx4, as a test case, to assess roles
   of electrostatic, hydrophobic, cation-pi, and aromatic interactions in
   amino acid sequence-dependent LLPS. We evaluated three different
   residue-residue interaction schemes with a shared electrostatic
   potential. Neither a common hydrophobicity scheme nor one augmented with
   arginine/lysine-aromatic cation- pi interactions consistently accounted
   for available experimental LLPS data on the wild-type, a
   charge-scrambled, a phenylalanineto-alanine (FtoA), and an
   arginine-to-lysine (RtoK) mutant of Ddx4 IDR. In contrast, interactions
   based on contact statistics among folded globular protein structures
   reproduce the overall experimental trend, including that the RtoK mutant
   has a much diminished LLPS propensity. Consistency between simulation
   and experiment was also found for RtoK mutants of P-granule protein
   LAF-1, underscoring that, to a degree, important LLPS-driving pi-related
   interactions are embodied in classical statistical potentials. Further
   elucidation is necessary, however, especially of phenylalanine's role in
   condensate assembly because experiments on FtoA and
   tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutants suggest that LLPS-driving
   phenylalanine interactions are significantly weaker than posited by
   common statistical potentials. Protein-protein electrostatic
   interactions are modulated by relative permittivity, which in general
   depends on aqueous protein concentration. Analytical theory suggests
   that this dependence entails enhanced interprotein interactions in the
   condensed phase but more favorable protein-solvent interactions in the
   dilute phase. The opposing trends lead to only a modest overall impact
   on LLPS.}},

   12-year-old subtropical riparian forest undergoing passive restoration
   (based on spontaneous natural regeneration), and aimed to evaluate the
   regenerating vegetation using two monitoring protocols developed for
   active ecological restoration. The following indicators of restoration
   success were evaluated: canopy cover; basal area; above-ground biomass;
   total richness; richness and density of regenerating trees. Passive
   restoration strategy has been found to be successful in the study area
   as the observed values for the indicators (except basal area and
   biomass) were above reference values specified for a 12-year-old active
   restoration. Our results also show that for most of the indicators of
   restoration success, the reference values established for the evaluation
   of active restoration projects may be surpassed through unassisted
   natural regeneration, suggesting the feasibility of the application of
   these monitoring protocols for the evaluation of passive restoration
   projects.}},

Abstract = {{The high demand of efficient large-scale machining operations by
   concurrently decreasing operating time and costs has led to an
   increasing usage of mobile robotic systems. This paper introduces a
   mobile robotic system which is consisted of a hybrid robot named TriMule
   on an automated guided vehicle, and a fringe-projection-based
   measurement system. TriMule exhibits desirable performance in terms of
   rigidity, accuracy, work envelop and reconfigurability. It is therefore
   suitable to be built on an autonomous platform for multi-station
   manufacturing in situ. In order to increase the absolute accuracy of the
   mobile robotic system, the fringe-projection-based measurement system
   obtains high accuracy and high density cloud to measure the position and
   orientation of the robot and workpiece in relation to each other. This
   system is suitable for large-scale manufacturing in situ, drilling,
   riveting and high-speed milling for example.}},

Abstract = {{Parys Mountain or Mynydd Parys (Isle of Anglesey, United Kingdom) is a
   mine-impacted environment, which accommodates a variety of acidophilic
   organisms. Our previous research of water and sediments from one of the
   surface acidic streams showed a high proportion of archaea in the total
   microbial community. To understand the spatial distribution of archaea,
   we sampled cores (0-20 cm) of sediment and conducted chemical analyses
   and taxonomic profiling of microbiomes using 16S rRNA gene amplicon
   sequencing in different core layers. The taxonomic affiliation of
   sequencing reads indicated that archaea represented between 6.2 and 54\%
   of the microbial community at all sediment depths. Majority of archaea
   were associated with the order Thermoplasmatales, with the most abundant
   group of sequences being clustered closely with the phylotype B\_DKE,
   followed by ``E-plasma,{''} ``A-plasma,{''} other yet uncultured
   Thermoplasmatales with Ferroplasma and Cuniculiplasma spp. represented
   in minor proportions. Thermoplasmatales were found at all depths and in
   the whole range of chemical conditions with their abundance correlating
   with sediment Fe, As, Cr, and Mn contents. The bacterial microbiome
   component was largely composed in all layers of sediment by members of
   the phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Nitrospirae, Firmicutes,
   uncultured Chloroflexi (AD3 group), and Acidobacteria. This study has
   revealed a high abundance of Thermoplasmatales in acid mine
   drainage-affected sediment layers and pointed at these organisms being
   the main contributors to carbon, and probably to iron and sulfur cycles
   in this ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the links between habit, fashion and
   subjectification to extend analysis of the clothed body beyond the
   semiotic frames that have tended to dominate discussions of fashion
   across the social sciences and humanities. Our goal is to explain how
   fashion's diverse materialities participate in the modulations of
   subjectivity, affecting bodies in diverse encounters between matter,
   signs and practices. We develop our analysis by way of Gilles Deleuze's
   discussion of encounters, habit and memory. Our principal contention is
   that fashion may usefully be theorised in terms of specific habits of
   coordination by which affects, memories, sensations and desires are
   transmitted between bodies in varied spatial, temporal, material and
   affective encounters. Following the work of John Protevi, we argue that
   such coordination expresses a distinctive mode of subjectification
   according to the specific encounters immanent to it. We ground this
   discussion in detailed analysis of the work of Melbourne artist Fiona
   Abicare. Abicare's installation and performance-based practice invokes
   the affective and habitual aspects of fashion as each is instantiated in
   encounters between bodies. Abicare's attention to the habits and
   memories of the clothed body alludes to the varied practices of
   subjectification by which diverse subjects of fashion emerge.}},

Abstract = {{We have adopted the concept of bispecific antibodies, which can
   simultaneously block or cross-link two different biomolecular targets,
   to create bispecific enzymes by exploiting the homodimeric quaternary
   structure of bacterial phosphotriesterases (PTEs). The PTEs from
   Brevundimonas diminuta and Agrobacterium radiobacter, whose engineered
   variants can efficiently hydrolyze organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents
   and pesticides, respectively, have attracted considerable interest for
   the treatment of the corresponding intoxications. OP nerve agents and
   pesticides still pose a severe toxicological threat in military
   conflicts, including acts of terrorism, as well as in agriculture,
   leading to >100000 deaths per year. In principle, engineered
   conventional homodimeric PTEs may provoke hydrolytic inactivation of
   individual OPs in vivo, and their application as catalytic bioscavengers
   via administration into the bloodstream has been proposed. However,
   their narrow substrate specificity would necessitate therapeutic
   application of a set or mixture of different enzymes, which complicates
   biopharmaceutical development. We succeeded in combining subunits from
   both enzymes and to stabilize their heterodimerization by rationally
   designing electrostatic steering mutations, thus breaking the natural C2
   symmetry. The resulting bispecific enzyme from two PTEs with different
   bacterial origin exhibits an ultrabroad OP substrate profile and allows
   the efficient detoxification of both nerve agents and pesticides. Our
   approach of combining two active sites with distinct substrate
   specificities within one artificial dimeric biocatalyst-retaining the
   size and general properties of the original enzyme without utilizing
   protein mixtures or much larger fusion proteins-not only should
   facilitate biological drug development but also may be applicable to
   oligomeric enzymes with other catalytic activities.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new configuration is proposed for using Savonius rotors
   by installing two Counter-Rotating Savonius Rotors (CRSR) together. In
   order to study the aerodynamic performance of the CRSR turbine, 2D
   unsteady turbulent flow around the CRSR turbine is simulated using
   commercial CFD software ANSYS-Fluent16.0. Turbulence modeling is done
   using k - omega SST model. Numerical results demonstrate a considerable
   improvement in aerodynamic performance of the CRSR turbine in comparison
   to a single conventional rotor. Effect of the distance between two
   rotors and different angular positions of two rotors on the CRSR turbine
   performance is studied. It is shown that the most effective parameter
   influencing the performance of the CRSR turbine is the distance between
   the rotors. Numerical results reveal that, locating two rotors in an
   optimal phase angle (theta = 90) and distance(S = 1.0D(0)), average
   power coefficient of the CRSR turbine can be increased to 21\%, which
   indicates a rise of 38\% compared to conventional Savonius rotors.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) is the
   prototype of an evolutionarily diversified large family that fine tunes
   osmoregulation but is likely to fulfill additional functions.
   Escherichia coli has six osmoprotective paralogs with different numbers
   of transmembrane helices. These helices are important for gating and
   sensing in MscS but the role of the additional helices in the paralogs
   is not understood. The medium-sized channel YnaI was extracted and
   delivered in native nanodiscs in closed-like and open-like conformations
   using the copolymer diisobutylene/ maleic acid (DIBMA) for structural
   studies. Here we show by electron cryomicroscopy that YnaI has an
   extended sensor paddle that during gating relocates relative to the pore
   concomitant with bending of a GGxGG motif in the pore helices. YnaI is
   the only one of the six paralogs that has this GGxGG motif allowing the
   sensor paddle to move outward. Access to the pore is through a vestibule
   on the cytosolic side that is fenestrated by side portals. In YnaI,
   these portals are obstructed by aromatic side chains but are still fully
   hydrated and thus support conductance. For comparison with large-sized
   channels, we determined the structure of YbiO, which showed larger
   portals and a wider pore with no GGxGG motif. Further in silico
   comparison of MscS, YnaI, and YbiO highlighted differences in the
   hydrophobicity and wettability of their pores and vestibule interiors.
   Thus, MscS-like channels of different sizes have a common core
   architecture but show different gating mechanisms and fine-tuned
   conductive properties.}},

Abstract = {{Network science and data analytics are used to quantify static and
   dynamic structures in George R. R. Martin's epic novels, A Song of Ice
   and Fire, works noted for their scale and complexity. By tracking the
   network of character interactions as the story unfolds, it is found that
   structural properties remain approximately stable and comparable to
   real-world social networks. Furthermore, the degrees of the most
   connected characters reflect a cognitive limit on the number of
   concurrent social connections that humans tend to maintain. We also
   analyze the distribution of time intervals between significant deaths
   measured with respect to the in-story timeline. These are consistent
   with power-law distributions commonly found in interevent times for a
   range of nonviolent human activities in the real world. We propose that
   structural features in the narrative that are reflected in our actual
   social world help readers to follow and to relate to the story, despite
   its sprawling extent. It is also found that the distribution of
   intervals between significant deaths in chapters is different to that
   for the in-story timeline; it is geometric rather than power law.
   Geometric distributions are memoryless in that the time since the last
   death does not inform as to the time to the next. This provides
   measurable support for the widely held view that significant deaths in A
   Song of Ice and Fire are unpredictable chapter by chapter.}},

Abstract = {{Background Data suggest an increased risk of thyroid dysfunction
   following iodine-based contrast material (IBCM) in children. Objective
   To estimate the prevalence of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
   abnormalities following exposure to a single dose of intravenous IBCM
   during computed tomography (CT) in young children. Materials and methods
   Inpatients <= 24 months of age who underwent a single CT with
   intravenous IBCM (exposed cohort) or abdominal ultrasound (US)
   (unexposed cohort) examination and had a TSH value obtained within 90
   days after imaging between January 2009 to November 2018 were
   identified. Propensity score matching with 20 variables was performed.
   Primary thyroid dysfunction was defined by abnormally high or low TSH
   value. Multivariable logistic regression identified risk factors,
   including intravenous IBCM, for thyroid dysfunction. Results From the
   eligible 4,215 imaging examinations, 114 unique patients were included
   in the propensity matched population (n=57 per group). Thyroid
   dysfunction was identified in 14\% (8/57) and 7\% (4/57) of the
   IBCM-exposed and IBCM-unexposed cohorts, respectively. No patient in
   either cohort was started on thyroid hormone supplementation within the
   3 months after imaging. Intravenous IBCM exposure was not a significant
   predictor of thyroid dysfunction on univariable (odds ratio {[}OR]=2.16,
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI]=0.61-7.64, P=0.23) or multivariable
   (OR=2.61, 95\% CI=0.65-10.55, P=0.18) analyses. Significant independent
   predictors of post-imaging thyroid dysfunction included height (OR=1.25,
   P=0.0095) and trisomy 21 (OR=4.04, P=0.019). Conclusion Hospitalized
   children <= 24 months of age who received a single dose of intravenous
   IBCM for CT examination had a similar prevalence of TSH abnormalities
   compared to a propensity score matched group who underwent abdominal US.
   One dose of intravenous IBCM likely does not cause prolonged TSH
   abnormalities; however, larger studies are needed.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},

Volume = {{125}},

Abstract = {{We studied the electronic Raman spectra of (Li1-xFex)OHFeSe as a
   function of light polarization and temperature. In the B-1g spectra
   alone we observe the redistribution of spectral weight expected for a
   superconductor and two well-resolved peaks below T-c. The nearly
   resolution-limited peak at 110 cm(-1) (13.6 meV) is identified as a
   collective mode. The peak at 190 cm(-1) (23.6 meV) is presumably another
   collective mode since the line is symmetric and its energy is
   significantly below the gap energy observed by single-particle
   spectroscopies. Given the experimental band structure of
   (Li1-xFex)OHFeSe, the most plausible explanations include conventional
   spin-fluctuation pairing between the electron bands and the incipient
   hole band and pairing between the hybridized electron bands. The absence
   of gap features in A(1G) and B-2g symmetry favors the second case. Thus,
   in spite of various differences between the pnictides and chalcogenides,
   this Letter demonstrates the proximity of pairing states and the
   importance of band structure effects in the Fe-based compounds.}},

Title = {{Circulating Soluble ST2 Predicts All-Cause Mortality in Severe Heart
   Failure Patients with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator}},
Journal = {{CARDIOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background. Heart failure (HF) is the terminal stage of all
   cardiovascular events. Although implantable cardioverter defibrillator
   (ICD) therapies have reduced mortality among the high-risk HF
   population, it is necessary to determine whether certain factors can
   predict mortality even after cardiac device implantation. Growth
   stimulation expressed gene 2 (ST2) is an emerging biomarker for HF
   patient stratification in different clinical settings. Aims. This study
   aimed to investigate the relationship between baseline soluble ST2
   (sST2) levels in serum and the clinical outcomes of high-risk HF
   patients with device implantation. Methods. Between January 2017 and
   August 2018, we prospectively recruited consecutive patients implanted
   with an ICD for heart failure, with LVEF <= 35\% as recommended, and
   analyzed the basic characteristics, baseline serum sST2, and NT-proBNP
   levels, with at least 1-year follow-up. All-cause mortality was the
   primary endpoint. Results. During a 643-day follow-up, all-cause
   mortality occurred in 16 of 150 patients (10.67\%). Incidence of
   all-cause mortality increased significantly in patients with sST2 levels
   above 34.98846 ng/ml (16.00\% vs. 5.33\%, P=0.034). After adjusting the
   model (age, gender, device implantation, prevention of sudden death,
   LVEDD, LVEF, WBC and CLBBB, hsTNT, etiology, and eGFR) and the model
   combined with NT-proBNP, the risk of all-cause death was increased by
   2.5\% and 1.9\%, respectively, per ng/ml of sST2. The best sST2 cutoff
   for predicting all-cause death was 43.42671 ng/ml (area under the curve:
   0.72, sensitive: 0.69, and specificity: 0.69). Compared to patients with
   sST2 levels below 43.42671 ng/ml, the risk of all-cause mortality was
   higher in those with values above the threshold (5.1\% vs. 21.2\%,
   P=0.002). ST2 level >= 43.42671 ng/ml was an independent predictor of
   all-cause mortality (HR: 3.30 {[}95\% CI 1.02-10.67]). Age (HR: 1.06
   {[}95\% CI: 1.01-1.12]) and increased NT-proBNP per 100 (HR: 1.02
   {[}95\% CI: 1.01-1.03]) were also associated with all-cause mortality in
   ICD patients. Conclusions. sST2 level was associated with risk of
   all-cause mortality, and a threshold of 43.43 ng/ml showed good
   distinguishing performance to predict all-cause mortality in patients
   with severe heart failure, recommended for ICD implantation. Patients
   with sST2 levels more than 43.42671 ng/ml even after ICD implantation
   should therefore be monitored carefully.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In the adult brain, biases in the allocation of spatial attention can be
   measured using a line bisection task and are directly relatable to
   neural attention signals in the fronto-parietal attention network.
   Behavioral studies on the development of spatial biases have yielded a
   host of inconsistent results, likely due to variance in sample size,
   definition of experimental groups, and motor confounds introduced by
   using a paper-and-pencil version of a line bisection task. Here, we used
   a perceptual, computerized version of this task and examined the
   development of spatial biases in 459 children from grades 1-8 and 61
   college freshmen. We found that children in early elementary grades
   exerted a significant leftward bias that gradually diminished with
   advancing grade level. We further show that among children in early
   elementary school grades, the degree of leftward spatial bias predicted
   better performance on a rapid automatized naming test, a predictor of
   reading ability. Significant leftward biases in early elementary school
   grades may be due to reading experience, thereby reflecting an
   interaction of the attention network with the evolving reading network.}},

Title = {{Vaccine elicitation of HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies from
   engineered B cells}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) can suppress viremia and
   protect against HIV infection. However, their elicitation is made
   difficult by low frequencies of appropriate precursor B cell receptors
   and the complex maturation pathways required to generate bnAbs from
   these precursors. Antibody genes can be engineered into B cells for
   expression as both a functional antigen receptor on cell surfaces and as
   secreted antibody. Here, we show that HIV bnAb-engineered primary mouse
   B cells can be adoptively transferred and vaccinated in immunocompetent
   mice resulting in the expansion of durable bnAb memory and long-lived
   plasma cells. Somatic hypermutation after immunization indicates that
   engineered cells have the capacity to respond to an evolving pathogen.
   These results encourage further exploration of engineered B cell
   vaccines as a strategy for durable elicitation of HIV bnAbs to protect
   against infection and as a contributor to a functional HIV cure. A
   vaccine to generate durable HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAb)
   from engineered B cells holds promise as an HIV functional cure. Here,
   the authors show that CRISPR/Cas-modified B cells expressing bnAbs as
   functional antigen receptors can be immunized to generate long-lived,
   germinal centre matured bnAb memory and plasma cells in mice.}},

Abstract = {{The eukaryotic cell develops organelles to sense and respond to the
   mechanical properties of its surroundings. These mechanosensing
   organelles aggregate into symmetry-breaking patterns to mediate cell
   motion and differentiation on substrate. The spreading of a cell plated
   onto a substrate is one of the simplest paradigms in which angular
   symmetry-breaking assemblies of mechanical sensors are seen to develop.
   We review evidence for the importance of the edge of the
   cell-extracellular matrix adhesion area in the aggregation of
   mechanosensors and develop a theoretical model for the clustering of
   mechanosensors into nascent focal adhesions on this contact ring. To
   study the spatial patterns arising on this topological feature, we use a
   one-dimensional lattice model with a nearest-neighbor interaction
   between individual integrin-mediated mechanosensors. We find the
   effective Ginzburg-Landau free energy for this model and determine the
   spectrum of spatial modes as the cell spreads and increases its contact
   area with the substrate. To test our model, we compare its predictions
   with measured distributions of paxillin in spreading fibroblasts.}},

Abstract = {{Cost-effective transition metal chalcogenides have aroused wide
   consideration as alternative anode materials in lithium ion batteries
   (LIBs) on account of their elevated lithium activity and considerable
   theoretical capacity. However, the significant challenge caused by the
   large volume change and shuttle effect of polysulfides during Li ion
   insertion/extraction severely restricts their practical application. In
   this work, the uniform MnO2 coating layer with a tunable thickness on
   Ni3S2 nanorod arrays has been achieved through a mild oriented-redox
   reaction by taking advantage of the mixing valence of Ni in Ni3S2
   {[}(Ni2+)(2)(Ni-0)(S-2(-))(2)] The core/shell structured nanorod arrays
   directly used as anode materials of LIBs demonstrate remarkably improved
   lithium storage performance including high rate capacity and long cycle
   life, which deliver a discharge capacity of 662 mA h g(-1) for ISO
   cycles at 0.5 C, corresponding to an elevated capacity retention of
   90.7\%. The improved electrochemical performances can be assigned to the
   generation of stable solid electrolyte interface films and suppression
   of the shuttle behavior with the protection of the MnO2 coating layer on
   Ni3S2 nanorod arrays.}},

Title = {{Nonreciprocal interactions induced by water in confinement}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Water mediates electrostatic interactions via the orientation of its
   dipoles around ions, molecules, and interfaces. This induced water
   polarization consequently influences multiple phenomena. In particular,
   water polarization affects ion adsorption and transport, biomolecular
   self-assembly, and surface chemical reactions. Therefore, it is of
   paramount importance to understand water-mediated interactions modulated
   by nanoconfinement at the nanoscale. Here we investigate the effective
   interaction between two oppositely charged ions in different positions
   in water confined between two graphene surfaces. We find that the
   attraction between physisorbed ions is enhanced in the surface normal
   direction while the in-plane interaction is almost unaffected. The
   attraction in the surface normal direction is further enhanced by
   decreasing the confinement distance. Conversely, when one ion is
   intercalated into the graphene layers, the interaction becomes
   repulsive. Moreover, upon exchange of the ions' positions along the
   surface normal direction, the interaction energy changes by about
   5k(B)T. The nonequivalent and directional properties found here,
   referred to as nonreciprocal interactions, cannot be explain by current
   water permittivity models in confinement. Our x-ray reflectivity
   experiments of the water structure near a graphene surface support our
   molecular dynamics simulation results. Our work shows that the water
   structure is not enough to infer electrostatic interactions near
   interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{A technique is presented for collecting data on both the spatial and
   temporal variations in the electrical properties of a film as it is
   deposited on a flexible substrate. A flexible printed circuit board
   substrate with parallel electrodes distributed across its surface was
   designed. Zinc oxide films were then deposited on the flexible substrate
   at different temperatures via atmospheric pressure chemical vapour
   deposition (AP-CVD) using a spatial atomic layer deposition system.
   AP-CVD is a promising high-throughput thin film deposition technique
   with applications in flexible electronics. Collecting data on the film
   properties in-situ allows us to directly observe how deposition
   conditions affect the evolution of those properties in real-time. The
   spatial uniformity of the growing film was monitored, and the various
   stages of film nucleation and growth on the polymer substrate were
   observed. The measured resistance of the films was observed to be very
   high until a critical amount of material has been deposited, consistent
   with Volmer-Weber growth. Furthermore, monitoring the film resistance
   during post-deposition cooling enabled immediate identification of
   metallic or semiconducting behaviour within the conductive ZnO films.
   This technique allows for a more complete understanding of metal
   chalcogen film growth and properties, and the high volume of data
   generated will be useful for future implementations of machine-learning
   directed materials science.}},

Abstract = {{Computational thinking is a means to understand and solve complex
   problems through using computer science concepts and techniques. While
   there is an increase in the number of initiatives focusing on coding,
   whether they (a) address computational thinking and problem-solving
   skills and (b) use methods of teaching problem solving is yet to be
   explored. As a preliminary step, this study focuses on examining 3rd
   grade lesson plans at Code.org. The analysis identified various
   components of computational thinking and problem solving as well as
   specific problem-solving teaching methods used to address these skills.
   Besides such cognitive outcomes, the findings also revealed affective,
   reflective, and social aspects of learning supported in the lessons.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to select morphological keys for the
   identification of individual endangered long-tailed gorals through
   analysis of photographic data and to use these morphological keys to
   determine the number and population composition of gorals living in the
   Osaek Region of Seoraksan National Park. Amongst 8149 photos taken using
   73 cameras in the Osaek Region, 2057 photos of faces and horns were
   analysed. The presence and absence of horns, shape of the horns,
   proportion of the ring to the length of the horn and facial colour
   pattern were selected as morphological keys to identify individual
   gorals. To verify the accuracy of the morphological keys for identifying
   gorals, a blind test was performed on gorals residing in the sanctuary
   of the Yanggu Goral Restoration Center. The test revealed that the
   population and age of gorals were discerned correctly by the
   morphological keys, but there was a 12.5\% error in discriminating
   between sexes in gorals aged over 10 years. Fifty-six gorals were
   identified from 2057 pictures, based on the morphological keys and
   methods developed in this study. The population of 56 individuals
   consisted of 43 individuals aged over 2 years (subadult or adult) and 13
   offspring aged less than 2 years, with a ratio of 3.3:1. Of the total 56
   individuals, 45\% were adults aged 10 years or older, 18\% were adults
   aged 3-10 years, 7\% were subadults aged 2- 23\% were offspring aged
   less than 2 years and 7\% were individuals aged 2 years or older, whose
   age and sex could not be confirmed. The sex ratio of males to females
   was 1.17:1, with a corrected sex ratio of 1:1 considering the 12.5\%
   error rate for gorals aged over 10 years, amongst the 39 gorals aged
   over 2 years.}},

Title = {{Lung Epithelial TRPA1 Mediates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Lung
   Inflammation in Bronchial Epithelial Cells and Mice}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 was originally thought to be the sole pattern
   recognition receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Transient receptor
   potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), a Ca2+-permeant channel, has been suggested
   as a non-TLR receptor membrane-bound sensor of LPS. We recently reported
   that TRPA1 is expressed in lung epithelial cells (LECs) and mediates
   lung inflammation induced by cigarette smoke. However, the role of TRPA1
   in LPS-induced lung inflammation has not been conclusively defined, and
   its underlying cellular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, our in
   vitro results showed that LPS sequentially produced a cascade of events,
   including the elevation of intracellular Ca2+, the activation of NADPH
   oxidase, increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), the
   activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor-kB
   (NF-kappa B) signaling, and the induction of IL-8. The increase in
   intracellular Ca2+ was inhibited by HC030031 (a TRPA1 antagonist) but
   was unaffected by TAK-242 (a TLR-4 inhibitor). The activation of NADPH
   oxidase was prevented by its inhibitor apocynin, EGTA (an extracellular
   Ca2+ chelator), and HC030031. The increase in intracellular ROS was
   attenuated by apocynin, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC, a ROS scavenger), EGTA,
   and HC030031. The activation of the MAPK/NF-kappa B signaling was halted
   by NAC, EGTA, and HC030031. IL-8 induction was suppressed by HC030031
   and TRPA1 siRNA, and further reduced by the combination of HC030031 and
   TAK-242. Our in vivo studies showed that trpa1(-/-) mice exhibited a
   reduced level of LPS-induced lung inflammation compared with wild-type
   mice as evidenced by the alleviations of increases in vascular
   permeability, inflammatory cell infiltration, inflammatory cytokine
   levels, oxidative stress, and MAPK signaling activation. Thus, in LECs,
   LPS may activate TRPA1 resulting in an increase in Ca2+ influx. The
   increased intracellular Ca2+ leads to NADPH oxidase activation, which
   causes an increase in intracellular ROS. The intracellular ROS activates
   the MAPK/NF-kappa B signaling resulting in IL-8 induction. This
   mechanism may possibly be at work to induce lung inflammation in mice.}},

   myeloma: a retrospective study}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Background Novel agents such as proteasome inhibitors have been
   developed for several years to treat multiple myeloma. Although multiple
   myeloma is a low-risk disease for developing tumor lysis syndrome (TLS),
   treatment with these novel therapies might increase TLS risk. Previous
   studies, mostly case reports or case series, have reported
   bortezomib-induced TLS in patients with multiple myeloma. This study
   aimed to investigate risk factors associated with TLS development in
   multiple myeloma patients. Methods We retrospectively investigated
   incidences of laboratory and clinical TLS (LTLS and CTLS, respectively)
   in patients who received primary therapy for treatment-naive,
   symptomatic multiple myeloma between May 2007 and January 2018. We used
   multivariate logistic regression analyses to evaluate the associations
   between TLS and several parameters previously reported to be associated
   with increased risk. Results This study included 210 patients with
   multiple myeloma, of which ten (4.8\%) had LTLS and seven (3.3\%) had
   CTLS. The characteristics of the administered anticancer or prophylactic
   antihyperuricemic agents were similar between patients with and without
   TLS. Multivariate analyses revealed that TLS was most strongly
   associated with bortezomib-containing therapy (odds ratio = 3.40, P =
   0.069), followed by male sex (odds ratio = 2.29, P = 0.153). In a
   subgroup analysis focused on men, treatment with bortezomib-containing
   therapy was significantly associated with increased risk of TLS (odds
   ratio = 8.51, P = 0.046). Conclusion In the present study, we
   investigated the risk factors associated with TLS development in 210
   multiple myeloma patients, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the
   largest number of patients reported to date. Furthermore, this study is
   the first to evaluate TLS risk factors in MM by adjusting for the
   effects of potential confounding factors in patients' backgrounds.
   Consequently, we found that bortezomib-containing therapy increases the
   risk of TLS in male patients with multiple myeloma. TLS risk should be
   evaluated further in low-risk diseases such as multiple myeloma, since a
   significant number of novel therapies can achieve high antitumor
   responses.}},

Abstract = {{DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic mark that regulates normal
   mammalian embryonic development. DNA methylation profiles are not always
   static, especially during germline development. In zygotes, DNA is
   typically highly methylated but, during preimplantation, DNA methylation
   is erased globally. Then, at the start of post-implantation development
   in mouse embryos, DNA again becomes dramatically hypermethylated.
   Chromatin structure regulates the accessibility of DNA-modifying enzymes
   to target DNA. Beyond that, however, our understanding of the pathway by
   which chromatin regulation initiates changes in global DNA methylation
   during mouse embryonic development remains incomplete. To analyse the
   relationship between global regulation of DNA methylation and chromatin
   status, we examined 5-methylcytosine (5mC), modified by the DNA
   methyltransferase DNMT, and the oxidative derivative
   5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC), converted from 5mC by TET-family enzymes,
   by means of immunofluorescence staining of mitotic chromosomes in mouse
   embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Our comparison of immunostaining patterns
   for those epigenetic modifications in wild-type, DNMT-deficient, and
   TET-deficient ESCs allowed us to visualise cell cycle-mediated DNA
   methylation changes, especially in euchromatic regions. Our findings
   suggest that DNA methylation patterns in undifferentiated mouse ESCs are
   stochastically balanced by the opposing effects of two activities:
   demethylation by TET and subsequent remethylation by DNMT.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To determine the leading causes of death in intracerebral hemorrhage
   (ICH) survivors, we used administrative data from 3 large US states to
   identify adult survivors of a first-time spontaneous ICH and track all
   hospital readmissions resulting in death.
   Methods
   We performed a longitudinal analysis of prospectively collected claims
   data from hospitalizations in California (2005-2011), New York
   (2005-2014), and Florida (2005-2014). Adult residents admitted with a
   nontraumatic ICH who survived to discharge were included. Patients were
   followed for a primary outcome of any readmission resulting in death.
   The cause of death was defined as the primary diagnosis assigned at
   discharge. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards and multinomial
   logistic regression were used to determine factors associated with the
   risk for and cause of death.
   Results
   Of 72,432 ICH survivors (mean age 68 years {[}SD 16], 48\% female),
   12,753 (18\%) died during a median follow-up period of 4.0 years
   (interquartile range 2.3-6.3). The leading causes of death were
   infection (34\%), recurrent intracranial hemorrhage (14\%), cardiac
   disease (8\%), respiratory failure (8\%), and ischemic stroke (5\%).
   Death in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) was more likely to be
   caused by ischemic stroke (odds ratio {[}OR] 2.4, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] 1.9-2.9, p < 0.001) and less likely to be caused by
   recurrent intracranial hemorrhage (OR 0.7, 95\% CI 0.6-0.8, p < 0.001)
   compared to patients without AF.
   Conclusions
   Infection is the leading cause of death in all ICH survivors. Survivors
   with AF were at increased risk for death from ischemic stroke. These
   findings will help prioritize interventions aimed to improve long-term
   survival and recovery in ICH survivors.}},

Title = {{FluoSim: simulator of single molecule dynamics for fluorescence
   live-cell and super-resolution imaging of membrane proteins}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence live-cell and super-resolution microscopy methods have
   considerably advanced our understanding of the dynamics and mesoscale
   organization of macro-molecular complexes that drive cellular functions.
   However, different imaging techniques can provide quite disparate
   information about protein motion and organization, owing to their
   respective experimental ranges and limitations. To address these issues,
   we present here a robust computer program, called FluoSim, which is an
   interactive simulator of membrane protein dynamics for live-cell imaging
   methods including SPT, FRAP, PAF, and FCS, and super-resolution imaging
   techniques such as PALM, dSTORM, and uPAINT. FluoSim integrates
   diffusion coefficients, binding rates, and fluorophore photo-physics to
   calculate in real time the localization and intensity of thousands of
   independent molecules in 2D cellular geometries, providing simulated
   data directly comparable to actual experiments. FluoSim was thoroughly
   validated against experimental data obtained on the canonical
   neurexin-neuroligin adhesion complex at cell-cell contacts. This unified
   software allows one to model and predict membrane protein dynamics and
   localization at the ensemble and single molecule level, so as to
   reconcile imaging paradigms and quantitatively characterize protein
   behavior in complex cellular environments.}},

Abstract = {{Inflammatory signaling is required for hematopoietic stem and progenitor
   cell (HSPC) development. Here, we studied the involvement of RIG-I-like
   receptors (RLRs) in HSPC formation. Rig-I or Mda5 deficiency impaired,
   while Lgp2 deficiency enhanced, HSPC emergence in zebrafish embryos.
   Rig-I or Mda5 deficiency reduced HSPC numbers by inhibiting inflammatory
   signals that were in turn enhanced in Lgp2 deficient embryos.
   Simultaneous reduction of Lgp2 and either Rig-I or Mda5 rescued
   inflammatory signals and HSPC numbers. Modulating the expression of the
   signaling mediator Traf6 in RLR deficient embryos restored HSPC numbers.
   Repetitive element transcripts could be detected in hemogenic
   endothelial cells and HSPCs, suggesting a role as RLR ligands. Indeed,
   ectopic expression of repetitive elements enhanced HSPC formation in
   wild-type, but not in Rig-I or Mda5 deficient embryos. Manipulation of
   RLR expression in mouse fetal liver HSPCs indicated functional
   conservation among species. Thus, repetitive elements transcribed during
   development drive RLR-mediated inflammatory signals that regulate HSPC
   formation.}},

Abstract = {{Single-phase active impedance hybrid active power filter is design to
   mitigate harmonic and reactive caused by the ever-increasing nonlinear
   loads. Nonlinear loads have been increased in residential and commercial
   as well as industrial sectors. Single-phase nonlinear loads contribute a
   harmonics and low power factor for the power systems. Single-phase
   active impedance hybrid active power filter was investigated to actively
   adjust multiple active short circuits. The dominant load current
   harmonics are compensated due to its multiple short effects over the
   single-tuned LC filter. At the same time, the conservative power theory
   (CPT) base reactive current extraction method was applied to actively
   regulate the reactive power. The amount of the fundamental filter
   reactive current obtained from CPT determines the reactive power
   compensation. The results were analyzed and presented in collaboration
   with the MATLAB/Simulink environment and TMS320F28335 board. The active
   impedance and CPT based control achieved a harmonic compensation (from
   65.96\% to 3.20\%) and power factor correction from 0.85 to 0.95.
   Therefore, the active impedance hybrid active power filter can be taken
   as a good candidate for harmonic and reactive compensation with
   extending the conventional hybrid active power filter (HAPF) into
   multiple active tuned filters. It has potential practical benefit to
   avoid regular field retuning the passive filter in the industry.
   Moreover, it can also apply for PQ compensation using the existing PPF.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate cerebral blood flow (CBF) differences in
   patients with left- and right-sided pulsatile tinnitus (LPT and RPT) and
   healthy controls (HCs) to further explore the lateralization effects of
   PT using arterial spin labeling (ASL).
   Methods: ASL data from 21 RPT patients, 17 LPT patients and 21 HCs were
   reviewed. Voxel-wise analysis and region of interest analysis were
   performed to explore differences in CBF among the three groups. Tinnitus
   Handicap Inventory (THI) score and tinnitus duration were obtained from
   each patient.
   Results: Voxel-wise analysis showed that the CBF of the left inferior
   parietal gyrus was increased in both RPT and LPT patients compared with
   HCs (P < 0.001). Region of interest analysis revealed that the CBF of
   the left primary auditory cortex (PAC) was higher than that of the
   right, while the CBF of the right secondary auditory cortex (SAC) and
   auditory association cortex was higher than that of the left. These
   lateralization effects were present in all three groups. Compared with
   HCs, RPT patients showed increased CBF in the left PAC and SAC (PAC: P =
   0.036; SAC: P = 0.012). No significant correlations were found between
   PT duration or THI score and altered CBF in above regions.
   Conclusion: Increased CBF in the left inferior parietal gyrus is a
   common feature in both RPT and LPT patients, regardless of the perceived
   side of PT. The lateralization effects of auditory cortices may be a
   physiological characteristic of the normal brain. These findings may
   provide a new perspective for understanding the neurological
   pathophysiology of PT.}},

Title = {{Right Atrial Pressure During Exercise Predicts Survival in Patients With
   Pulmonary Hypertension}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background
   We investigated changes in right atrial pressure (RAP) during exercise
   and their prognostic significance in patients assessed for pulmonary
   hypertension (PH).
   Methods and Results
   Consecutive right heart catheterization data, including RAP recorded
   during supine, stepwise cycle exercise in 270 patients evaluated for PH,
   were analyzed retrospectively and compared among groups of patients with
   PH (mean pulmonary artery pressure {[}mPAP] >= 25 mm Hg),
   exercise-induced PH (exPH; resting mPAP <25 mm Hg, exercise mPAP >30 mm
   Hg, and mPAP/cardiac output >3 Wood Units (WU)), and without PH (noPH).
   We investigated RAP changes during exercise and survival over a median
   (quartiles) observation period of 3.7 (2.8-5.6) years. In 152 patients
   with PH, 58 with exPH, and 60 with noPH, median (quartiles) resting RAP
   was 8 (6-11), 6 (4-8), and 6 (4-8) mm Hg (P<0.005 for noPH and exPH
   versus PH). Corresponding peak changes (95\% CI) in RAP during exercise
   were 5 (4-6), 3 (2-4), and -1 (-2 to 0) mm Hg (noPH versus PH P<0.001,
   noPH versus exPH P=0.027). RAP increase during exercise correlated with
   mPAP/cardiac output increase (r=0.528, P<0.001). The risk of death or
   lung transplantation was higher in patients with exercise-induced RAP
   increase (hazard ratio, 4.24; 95\% CI, 1.69-10.64; P=0.002) compared
   with patients with unaltered or decreasing RAP during exercise.
   Conclusions
   In patients evaluated for PH, RAP during exercise should not be assumed
   as constant. RAP increase during exercise, as observed in exPH and PH,
   reflects hemodynamic impairment and poor prognosis. Therefore, our data
   suggest that changes in RAP during exercise right heart catheterization
   are clinically important indexes of the cardiovascular function.}},

Abstract = {{A methionine-rich low complexity (LC) domain is found within a
   C-terminal region of the TDP43 RNA-binding protein. Self-association of
   this domain leads to the formation of labile cross-beta polymers and
   liquid-like droplets. Treatment with H2O2 caused phenomena of
   methi-onine oxidation and droplet melting that were reversed upon
   exposure of the oxidized protein to methionine sulfoxide reductase
   enzymes. Morphological features of the cross-beta polymers were revealed
   by H2O2-mediated footprinting. Equivalent TDP43 LC domain footprints
   were observed in polymerized hydrogels, liquid-like droplets, and living
   cells. The ability of H2O2 to impede cross-beta polymerization was
   abrogated by the prominent M337V amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-causing
   mutation. These observations may offer insight into the biological role
   of TDP43 in facilitating synapse-localized translation as well as
   aberrant aggregation of the protein in neurodegenerative diseases.}},

Title = {{ANLN, Regulated by SP2, Promotes Colorectal Carcinoma Cell Proliferation
   via PI3K/AKT and MAPK Signaling Pathway}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE SURGERY}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Aberrant expression of Anillin (ANLN) has been shown to function in the
   development of multiple cancers. However, its effects on colorectal
   carcinoma (CRC) remain unclear. We aimed to explore the role of ANLN in
   CRC development.
   Methods
   By real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), Western
   blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC), we assessed the expression level
   of ANLN in CRC tissues and cell lines. The role of ANLN in CRC cell
   proliferation was evaluated by CCK-8 assays, colony formation assays,
   EdU assays and cell cycle assays. A mouse tumorigenic model was
   established to evaluate the in vivo function of ANLN.
   Results
   We found that ANLN was overexpressed in CRC tissues and cell lines.
   Highly expressed ANLN correlated with tumor size, tumor number, and
   stage in patients with CRC. Silencing ANLN in CRC cell lines suppressed
   proliferation both in vitro and in vivo and induced G0/G1 cell cycle
   arrest. Downregulation of ANLN led to reduced phosphorylated levels of
   AKT and ERK. However, total AKT protein showed no change. SP2, a
   critical transcription factor, was implicated in the upregulation of
   ANLN.
   Conclusions
   Our study demonstrated that ANLN regulates CRC cell proliferation via
   the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways, indicating that ANLN may represent a
   novel and effective target for CRC treatment.}},

Title = {{Periods of refracted P-waves in coal seams and their applications in

Abstract = {{The direct and accurate estimations of coal thicknesses are
   prerequisites for intelligent mining practices. One of the most
   effective methods for detecting the distributions of coal thicknesses in
   coal mining panels is the in-seam seismic (ISS) method. In the present
   study, after examining the formation processes and propagation
   characteristics of refracted P-waves in ISS data, it was concluded that
   the refracted P-waves in coal seams are mainly formed by the multiple
   transmission and reflection of the P-waves between the coal and rock
   interfaces of roof and floor at critical angles. This results in the
   refracted P-waves having strong periodicity, and these periods are
   proportional to the coal thicknesses. This study adopted numerical
   simulation models with different coal thicknesses, and the
   aforementioned periodicity characteristics were examined. It was found
   that the coal seam thicknesses could be calculated using the periods of
   the refracted P-waves. However, in thin- or medium-thick coal seams, it
   was found that multiple transmitted P-waves overlapped and the periods
   could not be read directly. Therefore, in order to solve this problem,
   this study composed source wavelets with the main frequency of the
   source signals and then composite synthetic P-waves by convoluting the
   source wavelets with the sequences of various coal thicknesses. The
   suitable estimated coal thickness corresponded to the minimum value of
   the errors between the synthetic and actual refracted P-waves. An
   experiment was conducted in the No. 42224 panel of the Chaigou Coal Mine
   in order to validate the proposed method. The experimental results
   revealed that the estimated coal thicknesses from the refracted P-waves
   were consistent with the actual geologic conditions in the coal mine.
   Due to the fact that the refracted P-waves arrive earlier than other
   waves in seismic records, the refracted P-waves could be easily
   identified and processed. Overall, the proposed method was found to be a
   simple application process for accurate coal thickness estimations.}},

Abstract = {{While there is an emerging body of research on social procurement in
   construction, there is little empirical research from a facilities
   management perspective. This is despite the enormous untapped potential
   of the facilities management sector to create social value in the
   communities in which they operate. To address this gap in research, this
   paper presents an in-depth case study of an innovative social
   procurement initiative developed by a major Australian facilities
   management organisation. Integrating research in the fields of
   employment studies, facilities management and social value, it provides
   new empirical evidence of the significant affective, cognitive,
   behavioural and situational social value outcomes which can be generated
   through facilities management. These are best achieved through new
   hybrid partnerships between business, government, not-for-profit,
   community and educational organisations which create shared value,
   underpinned by a common interest in maximising social value for the
   communities involved. More research is needed into the types of
   attributes, skills and resources that facilitate such outcomes, the
   attributes of organisations most likely to be able to collaborate and
   the types of cross-sector partnerships which work.}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Based on proxy resignature, the signature transformation between trust
   domains of different cryptographic systems is realized with the help of
   the cloud authentication center, so as to achieve cross-domain access
   between users and cloud service providers in heterogeneous environment.
   Hierarchical ID tree realizes the uniqueness of identity in
   communication, and the security of heterogeneous cross-domain identity
   authentication is enhanced by the two-factor authentication of
   ``password+key{''} and temporary identity replacing real identity. The
   security of the scheme is proved under the CK model, which can
   anonymously trace entity identity, resist replay attacks, replacement
   attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks, and the simulation experiment is
   carried out. By searching it in related fields, no paper on
   heterogeneous cross-domain identity authentication based on proxy
   resignature has been published yet. The results of this paper show that
   the proposed scheme has better computing performance and higher

Abstract = {{Metal additive manufacturing is growing its impact on high-tech
   industrial sectors so far. The capability to recover and repair worn
   components, with costs that are gradually more affordable, is giving a
   boost to the development of these technologies. The direct laser metal
   deposition (DLMD) technology is taking a leading role in this domain.
   Manufacturing components, with high mechanical properties, require a
   careful process design and a continuous control. The monitoring of the
   thermal field thus assumes a crucial role in processes in which
   high-power sources are involved. Thermal treatments influence the
   microstructure, morphology and the grain size of the depositions indeed,
   which determine high-performance standards. In this work, an ytterbium
   fibre laser source was used to build single-track depositions of a
   nickel-based superalloy powder on a substrate of the same material.
   Temperature field monitoring was performed using a high-frequency (100
   Hz) IR thermal camera, allowing an accurate monitoring of peeks
   temperature, thermal cycles and thermal gradients. Thermal data and
   process parameters were compared with metallographic analysis to capture
   the relation between the geometrical and microstructural characteristics
   of clads. The study focuses on the influence of the powder feed rate and
   energy density on thermal parameters. An innovative approach to the
   solidification map method, commonly implemented with numerical
   simulations of welding and additive manufacturing, has been successfully
   applied to experimental data giving results consistent with the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{Background: To achieve Measles and Rubella elimination and Polio Endgame
   goals, Tanzania implemented country-wide integrated Supplementary
   Immunization Activities (SIAs) in October 2019 involving two injectable
   vaccines of MR and IPV. The SIAs targeted children aged between 9 and 59
   months for Measles-Rubella and 18 to 42 months for IPV vaccines. This
   article aims to share lessons learnt in the implementation of SIAs field
   guidelines in Tanzania in 2019 to inform future implementation of the
   SIAs within and outside the country's boundaries.
   Methods: Focus groups discussions (FGDs) were conducted among Regional
   Immunization and Vaccines Officers from all regions and National
   Supervisors and Partners responsible for implementing the SIAs. Key
   areas discussed were pre-planning activities, implementation, monitoring
   and evaluation of the SIAs based on key thematic areas including;
   planning and coordination, logistics management, trainings, and demand
   creation. Pre-described templates were used to guide the discussion and
   keep record of the discussions.
   Results: The SIAs achieved national target based on administrative
   coverage. This was due to a high sense of ownership of the SIAs and
   strong staff commitment to attain high coverage rates manifested through
   effective planning and coordination within and between levels; effective
   execution of SIAs activities; involvement of key stakeholders at all
   levels; and strong advocacy, communication and social mobilization
   activities. Despite the success observed through administrative
   coverage, the WHO target of attaining 95\% coverage using the gold
   standard - national coverage survey, was not reached. The main barrier
   to success was inadequate and delayed disbursement of funding.
   Conclusion: The 2019 SIA achieved high administrative coverage as a
   result of effective coordination; adequate micro-planning; timely
   logistical preparations; and effective demand creation activities.
   Future campaigns need to give high priority to hard-to-reach and densely
   populated areas during planning and ensure timely disbursement of funds
   to the operational level during implementation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this single-center, retrospective cohort analysis of hospitalized
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, we investigate whether
   inflammatory biomarker levels predict respiratory decline in patients
   who initially present with stable disease. Examination of C-reactive
   protein (CRP) trends reveals that a rapid rise in CRP levels precedes
   respiratory deterioration and intubation, although CRP levels plateau in
   patients who remain stable. Increasing CRP during the first 48 h of
   hospitalization is a better predictor (with higher sensitivity) of
   respiratory decline than initial CRP levels or ROX indices (a
   physiological score of respiratory function). CRP, the proinflammatory
   cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), and physiological measures of hypoxemic
   respiratory failure are correlated, which suggests a mechanistic link.
   Our work shows that rising CRP predicts subsequent respiratory
   deterioration in COVID-19 and may suggest mechanistic insight and a
   potential role for targeted immunomodulation in a subset of patients
   early during hospitalization.}},

Title = {{Metabolic Architecture of Acute Exercise Response in Middle-Aged Adults
   in the Community}},
Journal = {{CIRCULATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{1905-1924}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   Whereas regular exercise is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular
   disease and mortality, mechanisms of exercise-mediated health benefits
   remain less clear. We used metabolite profiling before and after acute
   exercise to delineate the metabolic architecture of exercise response
   patterns in humans.
   Methods:
   Cardiopulmonary exercise testing and metabolite profiling was performed
   on Framingham Heart Study participants (age 53 +/- 8 years, 63\% women)
   with blood drawn at rest (n=471) and at peak exercise (n=411).
   Results:
   We observed changes in circulating levels for 502 of 588 measured
   metabolites from rest to peak exercise (exercise duration 11.9 +/- 2.1
   minutes) at a 5\% false discovery rate. Changes included reductions in
   metabolites implicated in insulin resistance (glutamate, -29\%;
   P=1.5x10(-55); dimethylguanidino valeric acid {[}DMGV], -18\%;
   P=5.8x10(-18)) and increases in metabolites associated with lipolysis
   (1-methylnicotinamide, +33\%; P=6.1x10(-67)), nitric oxide
   bioavailability (arginine/ornithine + citrulline, +29\%;
   P=2.8x10(-169)), and adipose browning (12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic
   acid +26\%; P=7.4x10(-38)), among other pathways relevant to
   cardiometabolic risk. We assayed 177 metabolites in a separate
   Framingham Heart Study replication sample (n=783, age 54 +/- 8 years,
   51\% women) and observed concordant changes in 164 metabolites (92.6\%)
   at 5\% false discovery rate. Exercise-induced metabolite changes were
   variably related to the amount of exercise performed (peak workload),
   sex, and body mass index. There was attenuation of favorable excursions
   in some metabolites in individuals with higher body mass index and
   greater excursions in select cardioprotective metabolites in women
   despite less exercise performed. Distinct preexercise metabolite levels
   were associated with different physiologic dimensions of fitness (eg,
   ventilatory efficiency, exercise blood pressure, peak Vo(2)). We
   identified 4 metabolite signatures of exercise response patterns that
   were then analyzed in a separate cohort (Framingham Offspring Study;
   n=2045, age 55 +/- 10 years, 51\% women), 2 of which were associated
   with overall mortality over median follow-up of 23.1 years (P <= 0.003
   for both).
   Conclusions:
   In a large sample of community-dwelling individuals, acute exercise
   elicits widespread changes in the circulating metabolome. Metabolic
   changes identify pathways central to cardiometabolic health,
   cardiovascular disease, and long-term outcome. These findings provide a
   detailed map of the metabolic response to acute exercise in humans and
   identify potential mechanisms responsible for the beneficial
   cardiometabolic effects of exercise for future study.}},

Abstract = {{Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disrupting chemical. Its extensive use
   has led to the wide occurrence of BPA in various environmental
   ecosystems, at levels that may cause negative effects to the ecosystem
   and public health. Although there are many bacteria able to BPA
   utilization, only a few of them have a strong capacity for its
   biodegradation. Therefore, it is important to search for new bacteria
   strains, investigate their BPA biodegradation ability and potential
   effect of pH and other organic compounds on the process. These tasks
   have become the object of the present study. The results of our research
   show that for the newly isolated strains Acinetobacter sp. K1MN and
   Pseudomonas sp. BG12 after 15 days, with an initial BPA concentration of
   100 mg L- 1, the highest BPA removal was achieved at pH 8, while sodium
   glutamate as a biostimulant best accelerated BPA degradation. Kinetic
   data for BPA biodegradation by both strains best fitted the Monod model.
   The specific degradation rate and the half saturation constant were
   estimated respectively as 8.75 mg L- 1 day(- 1) and 111.27 mg L- 1 for
   Acinetobacter sp. K1MN, and 8.6 mg L- 1 day(- 1) and 135.79 mg L- 1 for
   Pseudomonas sp. BG12. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of
   BPA for Acinetobacter sp. K1MN was 120 mg L- 1 and for Pseudomonas sp.
   BG12 it was 123 mg L- 1. The toxicity bioassay (Microtox test) showed
   that elimination of BPA by both strains is accompanied by reduction of
   its toxic effect. The ability of tested strains to degrade BPA combined
   with their high resistance to this xenobiotic indicates that
   Acinetobacter sp. K1MN and Pseudomonas sp. BG12 are potential tools for
   BPA removal during wastewater treatment plant.}},

Abstract = {{Children's right to love is a recognised fundamental human need set down
   within the 1992 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
   This recognition stems from an acknowledgement that the Early Years of
   Development are emotionally driven (Degotardi, S., \& Sweller, N.
   (2012). Mind-mindedness in infant child-care: Associations with early
   childhood practitioner sensitivity and stimulation. Early Childhood
   Research Quarterly, 27(2), 253-265. doi:10.1016/j.ecresq.2011.09.002.).
   Young children respond best to those with whom they experience love and
   acceptance (Carter, M. A., \& Fewster, C. (2013). Diversifying early
   years' professional learning: One size no longer fits all. Australasian
   Journal of Early Childhood, 38(1), 73-x2060;80.). As such, love in the
   classroom is important as an empowering agent of children's well-being
   and achievement. Children's need and right to be surrounded by love
   poses a challenge for many early childhood teachers as they strive to
   meet the emotional needs of children within a professional care-based
   relationship (Goldstein, J. (2012). Children's development, health and
   well-being. Waterloo, Brussels: Toy Industries of Europe (TIE); Walsh,
   K., \& Brandon, L. (2012). Their children's first educators: Parents'
   views about child sexual abuse prevention education. Journal of Child
   and Family Studies, 21(5), 734-746. doi:10.1007/s10826-011-9526-4.).
   This research presents pre-service teachers' perspectives on love in
   early childhood education; their definitions, their understanding of its
   role within the development, and their visions of how it can be
   actualised within their practice.}},

   Methods This cross-sectional study evaluated 309 elderly patients (aged
   >= 65 years) admitted to one rural Hospital between April 2017 and March
   2019. We collected data on vitamin B1 level, age, sex, body mass index,
   albumin levels, area of residence, long-term care, dependent conditions,
   activities of daily living, Charlson comorbidity index, and appetite
   loss from the patients' electronic medical records. Vitamin B1
   deficiency was defined as serum vitamin B1 levels U, Student's t, and
   chi-square tests, followed by multivariable logistic regression, to
   examine the association between vitamin B1 deficiency and appetite loss.
   Results Eighty-eight (28.5\%) patients had vitamin B1 deficiency. In
   multivariable logistic regression, appetite loss (for both 1 week)
   before admission to the hospital showed a significant association with
   vitamin B1 deficiency (adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR] =10.80, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]: 5.16-22.00, P < .001; and AOR = 5.77, 95\%
   CI: 2.88-11.50, P < .001, respectively).
   Conclusions Appetite loss is associated with vitamin B1 deficiency in
   elderly Japanese patients living in rural areas. Therefore, physicians
   should be aware of the possibility of vitamin B1 deficiency in elderly
   patients with appetite loss and focus on early intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. We aimed to assess the changes of retinal microvascular
   parameters using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) between
   diabetes macular edema (DME) and controls. We assessed the changes
   between the baseline microvascular parameters and final treatment
   response in patients with DME, initially treated with intravitreal
   dexamethasone (DEX) implant followed by antivascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF) injections on an as-needed basis. Methods. This
   retrospective study included 90 DME patients and 24 healthy control
   subjects. All subjects had their best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and
   central macular thickness (CMT) measured at baseline and after 12
   months. Vessel density (VD) in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP)
   and deep capillary plexus (DCP) and the deep/superficial flow ratio at
   baseline were analyzed. A subgroup analysis was used to compare the
   treatment response. A poor-response group was defined by five or more
   retreatments at 12 months. Results. BCVA and CMT showed a significant
   improvement at 12 months (all p<0.001). The VD in the whole and
   parafoveal areas of the DCP was significantly reduced in DME patients
   compared to that in controls (all p<0.05). The DCP/SCP flow ratio was
   also significantly reduced in the DME group (1.08 +/- 0.03 vs. 1.05 +/-
   0.02, p=0.001). In the subgroup analysis, the VD in the foveal and whole
   DCP areas was significantly lower in the poor-response group than that
   in the good-response group (p=0.043 and p=0.048, respectively). The
   DCP/SCP flow ratio was also significantly lower in the poor-response
   group (p=0.011). Conclusion. DME correlated with significant retinal
   microvascular impairment in the DCP. A decreased DCP/SCP flow ratio was
   observed in patients with DME that exhibited a poor treatment response.
   Retinal microvascular parameters could predict the treatment response in
   DME and help optimize clinical outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{In Spain, the students of the Master of Sciences (MSc) level in Civil
   Engineering have competencies in airport design, construction,
   conservation, and exploitation. Considering the need for improving the
   knowledge of these students in this area, the School of Civil
   Engineering of A Coruna implemented in the subject of Infrastructure of
   Roads and Airports (ICA) a brief workshop on airport design. This paper
   presents a case study in which problem-based learning techniques were
   applied in this airport design workshop. To promote the students'
   interaction and improve their social skills, the workshop activities
   were conducted as onsite tasks. The workshop starting point was an
   individual real case of airport runway design. Master classes, practical
   lessons, private tutoring, specific software, audio-visual material, and
   supporting documentation posted on the ICA Moodle site were used as
   teaching and learning resources. In particular, an analysis of the basic
   International Civil Aviation Organization standards on airport design
   was used by the students to solve their problem. In addition, for the
   design of the runway orientation, the ICA students used both the Federal
   Aviation Administration's WindRose computer online application and the
   traditional manual method. The results of both methods were critically
   compared. The high level of satisfaction indicated by the survey
   conducted at the end of the subject indicated the success of this
   teaching and learning methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste was converted into carbon and the
   feasibility of utilizing it as a reinforcing filler material in a
   polypropylene (PP) matrix was investigated. The carbon produced by the
   pyrolysis of waste PET at 900 degrees C in nitrogen atmosphere contains
   high carbon content (>70 wt\%). PP/carbon composites were produced by
   melt blending process at varying loading concentrations. Scanning
   electron microscopy images at the fractured surface revealed that the
   carbon filler has better compatibility with the PP matrix. The
   mechanical, thermal, and rheological properties and surface morphology
   of the prepared composites were studied. The thermogravimetric analysis
   studies showed that the thermal stability of the PP/carbon composites
   was enhanced from 300 to 370 degrees C with 20 wt\% of carbon. At lower
   angular frequency (0.01 rad/s), the storage modulus (G `) of PP was 0.27
   Pa and those of PP with 10 and 20 wt\% carbon was 4.06 and 7.25 Pa,
   respectively. Among the PP/carbon composite prepared, PP with 5 wt\%
   carbon showed the highest tensile strength of 38 MPa, greater than that
   of neat PP (35 MPa). The tensile modulus was enhanced from 0.9 to 1.2
   GPa when the carbon content was increased from 0 to 20 wt\%.}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   Psychosis spectrum disorder has a complex pathoetiology characterised by
   interacting environmental and genetic vulnerabilities. The present study
   aims to investigate the role of gene-environment interaction using
   aggregate scores of genetic (polygenic risk score for schizophrenia
   (PRS-SCZ)) and environment liability for schizophrenia (exposome score
   for schizophrenia (ES-SCZ)) across the psychosis continuum.
   Methods
   The sample consisted of 1699 patients, 1753 unaffected siblings, and
   1542 healthy comparison participants. The Structured Interview for
   Schizotypy-Revised (SIS-R) was administered to analyse scores of total,
   positive, and negative schizotypy in siblings and healthy comparison
   participants. The PRS-SCZ was trained using the Psychiatric Genomics
   Consortiums results and the ES-SCZ was calculated guided by the approach
   validated in a previous report in the current data set. Regression
   models were applied to test the independent and joint effects of PRS-SCZ
   and ES-SCZ (adjusted for age, sex, and ancestry using 10 principal
   components).
   Results
   Both genetic and environmental vulnerability were associated with
   case-control status. Furthermore, there was evidence for additive
   interaction between binary modes of PRS-SCZ and ES-SCZ (above 75\% of
   the control distribution) increasing the odds for schizophrenia spectrum
   diagnosis (relative excess risk due to interaction = 6.79, {[}95\%
   confidential interval (CI) 3.32, 10.26], p < 0.001). Sensitivity
   analyses using continuous PRS-SCZ and ES-SCZ confirmed gene-environment
   interaction (relative excess risk due to interaction = 1.80 {[}95\% CI
   1.01, 3.32], p = 0.004). In siblings and healthy comparison
   participants, PRS-SCZ and ES-SCZ were associated with all SIS-R
   dimensions and evidence was found for an interaction between PRS-SCZ and
   ES-SCZ on the total (B = 0.006 {[}95\% CI 0.003, 0.009], p < 0.001),
   positive (B = 0.006 {[}95\% CI, 0.002, 0.009], p = 0.002), and negative
   (B = 0.006, {[}95\% CI 0.004, 0.009], p < 0.001) schizotypy dimensions.
   Conclusions
   The interplay between exposome load and schizophrenia genetic liability
   contributing to psychosis across the spectrum of expression provide
   further empirical support to the notion of aetiological continuity
   underlying an extended psychosis phenotype.}},

Title = {{Sphingolipids and Inositol Phosphates Regulate the Tau Protein
   Phosphorylation Status in Humanized Yeast}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Hyperphosphorylation of protein tau is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease
   (AD). Changes in energy and lipid metabolism have been correlated with
   the late onset of this neurological disorder. However, it is uncertain
   if metabolic dysregulation is a consequence of AD or one of the
   initiating factors of AD pathophysiology. Also, it is unclear whether
   variations in lipid metabolism regulate the phosphorylation state of
   tau. Here, we show that in humanized yeast, tau hyperphosphorylation is
   stimulated by glucose starvation in coincidence with the downregulation
   of Pho85, the yeast ortholog of CDK5. Changes in inositol phosphate (IP)
   signaling, which has a central role in energy metabolism, altered tau
   phosphorylation. Lack of inositol hexakisphosphate kinases Kcs1 and Vip1
   (IP6 and IP7 kinases in mammals) increased tau hyperphosphorylation.
   Similar effects were found by mutation of IPK2 (inositol polyphosphate
   multikinase), or PLC1, the yeast phospholipase C gene. These effects may
   be explained by IP-mediated regulation of Pho85. Indeed, this appeared
   to be the case for plc1, ipk2, and kcs1. However, the effects of Vip1 on
   tau phosphorylation were independent of the presence of Pho85,
   suggesting additional mechanisms. Interestingly, kcs1 and vip1 strains,
   like pho85, displayed dysregulated sphingolipid (SL) metabolism.
   Moreover, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of SL biosynthesis
   stimulated the appearance of hyperphosphorylated forms of tau, while
   increased flux through the pathway reduced its abundance. Finally, we
   demonstrated that Sit4, the yeast ortholog of human PP2A protein
   phosphatase, is a downstream effector of SL signaling in mediating the
   tau phosphorylation state. Altogether, our results add new knowledge on
   the molecular effectors involved in tauopathies and identify new targets
   for pharmacological intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The pathophysiology of renal disease progression in
   autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) involves not only
   cystogenesis but also endothelial dysfunction, leading to the activation
   of inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. This study evaluated the levels
   of biomarkers related to osmoregulation, immune system activation, and
   tubular injury in ADPKD patients with impaired or preserved renal
   function. Methods: This study included 26 ADPKD patients with modestly
   impaired renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate {[}eGFR]
   45-70 mL/min/1.73 m(2); Group A), 26 age- and sex-matched ADPKD patients
   with relatively preserved renal function (eGFR >70 mL/min/1.73 m(2);
   Group B), and 26 age- and sex-matched controls (Group C). Serum levels
   of copeptin, the inflammasome nucleotide-binding and oligomerization
   domain-like receptors pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), and
   soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) were
   measured with ELISA techniques. Results: Patients in Group A had higher
   levels of copeptin (median {[}interquartile range]: 50.44 {[}334.85]
   pg/mL), NLRP3 (5.86 {[}3.89] ng/mL), and suPAR (390.05 {[}476.53] pg/mL)
   compared to patients in Group B (32.38 {[}58.33], p = 0.042; 2.42
   {[}1.96], p < 0.001; and 313.78 {[}178.85], p = 0.035, respectively) and
   Group C (6.75 {[}6.43]; 1.09 {[}0.56]; and 198.30 {[}28.53],
   respectively; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Levels of all studied
   markers were also significantly higher in Group B patients compared to
   controls (p < 0.001), despite having similar eGFR. In patients with
   ADPKD, all studied biomarkers were correlated positively with
   asymmetric-dimethylarginine (ADMA) and endocan levels, and negatively
   with eGFR. ADMA and endocan levels were the only parameters
   independently associated with increased copeptin levels. Conclusions:
   This study showed that ADPKD patients with impaired and preserved renal
   function had higher copeptin, NLRP3, and suPAR levels than controls.
   Such findings support that cystogenesis and inflammation are associated
   with endothelial dysfunction, even in the early stages of ADKPD.}},

Abstract = {{Medicinal mushrooms have tremendous potential in production of bioactive
   compounds with diverse bioactivities while the biochemical potential of
   some specific mushroom strains (autochthonous for the region) in
   production of specific bioactive agents may be of the main importance in
   a continuous search for novel strains with supreme activities all over
   the world.
   In this study, the ethanolic (EtOH) and water (H2O) extracts of
   wild-growing polypore mushroom species were investigated: Trametes
   versicolor (L.) Lloyd and Stereum subtomentosum Pouzar. This study was
   designed to determine total phenol (TP), flavonoid (TF) and protein
   content (TPR) as well as LC/MS/MS phenolic profile related to in vitro
   antioxidant, antiproliferative (MTT assay) (AP) and DNA fragmentation
   properties.
   The H2O extracts expressed better antioxidant scavenging potential than
   EtOH showing the highest activity for the T. versicolor (IC50=5.6 mu
   g/mL, IC50=0.6 mu g/mL for DPPH. and OH., respectively) while O-2(.-)
   activity achieved the best activity for S. subtomentosum (IC50=4.1 mu
   g/mL). In contrary, the highest AP activity was obtained for the EtOH
   extracts of S. subtomentosum (IC50=141.1 mu g/mL). The EtOH extracts of
   both species showed the highest TP, TF and TPR content. Obtained results
   of DNA degradation indicate genotoxicity potential of the extracts at
   high concentration. The LC/MS/MS detection showed that the majority of
   analyzed extracts contained phenolic acids, p-hydroxybenzoic and
   protocatechuic acid.
   The obtained results suggest that analyzed medicinal mushroom species,
   T. versicolor and S. subtomentosum, could be of potential interest as
   new sources of strong natural antioxidants as well as antiproliferative
   agents in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate physiological variations of the
   water T2 relaxation time in vertebral bone marrow with respect to age,
   body mass index (BMI), sex and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) based
   on single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 3 T. Multi-TE
   single-voxel STEAM MRS data of a single lumbar vertebra (L4 or L5) from
   260 subjects (160/100 female/male, age: 0.7/37.1/77.7 years, BMI:
   13.6/26.2/44.5 kg/m(2) {[}min./median/max.]) with no history of
   vertebral bone marrow pathologies were retrospectively included. All
   data were processed using a joint series T2-constrained time
   domain-based water-fat model. Water T2 and PDFF data were analyzed using
   (a) Pearson's correlation r and (b) multiple linear regression without
   interactions of the independent variables. Min./median/max. water T2 and
   PDFF were 11.2/21.1/42.5 ms and 4.0\%/36.8\%/82.0\%, respectively.
   Pearson's correlation coefficients were significant (P < .05) for water
   T2 versus age (r = -0.429/-0.210 female/male) and for water T2 versus
   PDFF (r = -0.580/-0.546 female/male) for females and males,
   respectively. Females showed significant higher water T2 values compared
   with males (P < .001). Multiple linear regression for water T2 without
   interactions revealed a R-2 = 0.407 with PDFF (P < .001) and sex (P <
   .001) as significant predictors. The current study suggests that under
   physiological conditions vertebral bone marrow water T2 is negatively
   correlated with age and PDFF and shows significant differences between
   females and males. The observed systematic trends are of relevance for
   the evaluation of T2 values and T2-weighted bone marrow parameters.
   Further research on the exact mechanisms and drivers of the observed
   water T2 behavior is required.}},

Abstract = {{Enabling green fabrication processes for energy storage devices is
   becoming a key aspect in order to achieve a sustainable fabrication
   cycle. Here, the focus was on the exploitation of the tragacanth gum, an
   exudated gum like arabic and karaya gums, as green binder for the
   preparation of carbon-based materials for electrochemical capacitors.
   The electrochemical performance of tragacanth (TRGC)-based electrodes
   was thoroughly investigated and compared with another water-soluble
   binder largely used in this field, sodium-carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC).
   Apart from the higher sustainability both in production and processing,
   TRGC exhibited a lower impact on the obstruction of pores in the final
   active material film with respect to CMC, allowing for more available
   surface area. This directly impacted the electrochemical performance,
   resulting in a higher specific capacitance and better rate capability.
   Moreover, the TRGC-based supercapacitor showed a superior thermal
   stability compared with CMC, with a capacity retention of about 80 \%
   after 10000 cycles at 70 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary education is characterised by a sequence of transitions that
   are linked to educational inequality. Regarding social background
   effects, inequalities relate to disparities in educational achievement
   (primary effects) and educational decisions (secondary effects). In the
   present study, both primary and secondary effects are analysed based on
   an entire student cohort in the Hamburg school system (KESS study)
   across the course of secondary education, i.e. from entering secondary
   school to aiming for higher education. The KHB method is applied in
   order to decompose the effects, including transitions to upper secondary
   education. In line with previous research, total social background
   effects decrease across educational trajectories. No clear pattern
   emerges concerning an assumed increase in the relative importance of
   secondary effects. Primary effects operationalised by school grades are
   slightly predominant in the transition to lower secondary education, and
   nearly the same ratio is found for the transition to upper secondary
   education. However, regarding the aim to enter higher education, the
   relative importance of secondary effects is more clearly discernible.}},

Title = {{Third molar agenesis in modern humans with and without agenesis of other
   teeth}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: The number of teeth in the human dentition is of interest
   both from developmental and evolutionary aspects. The present
   case-control study focused on the formation of third molars in modern
   humans aiming to shed more light on the most variable tooth class in the
   dentition.
   Materials and Methods: For this reason, we investigated third molar
   formation in a sample of 303 individuals with agenesis of teeth other
   than third molars (agenesis group) and compared it to a sex and age
   matched control group of 303 individuals without agenesis of teeth other
   than third molars.
   Results: The prevalence of third molar agenesis in the agenesis group
   was 50.8\%, which is significantly higher than the 20.5\% in the control
   group (p < 0.001). The chance of a missing third molar in the agenesis
   group was increased by 38.3\% (p < 0.001), after controlling for the
   agenesis in other teeth factor. When considering the amount of missing
   third molars per individual, a clear tendency towards more missing third
   molars was evident in the agenesis group compared to the control group.
   The frequency of bilaterally missing third molars in the agenesis group
   was 29\% in the maxilla, as well as in the mandible, which is about
   three times higher than the frequency of unilaterally missing third
   molars (p < 0.001). In the control group, bilaterally missing third
   molars occurred in 8.6\% in the maxilla and 8.9\% in the mandible.
   Conclusion: The present results indicate that genetic factors involved
   in tooth agenesis affect also the dentition as a whole. Furthermore, the
   third molars are more vulnerable to factors involved in agenesis of
   other teeth and they are more often affected as a whole. These findings
   seem to be associated with the evolutionary trend in humans towards
   reduced molar number.}},

Title = {{Vulnerabilities of cities to disaster: the 2003 earthquake in Boumerdes
   (Algeria)}},
Journal = {{GEOJOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{This study attempts to explain, through the analysis of the 2003
   earthquake in the province of Boumerdes. The unequal distribution of
   damages between one city and another by testing the risk management
   model according to which social and physical vulnerabilities are
   directly linked to places. To assess physical and social vulnerabilities
   before and after this disaster, we selected a set of indices based on a
   deductive approach, and adopted GIS to spatialize these vulnerabilities.
   The results show that the degree of the population vulnerability to
   hazards does not depend exclusively on the proximity of the source or
   the physical nature of the hazard, but that the most vulnerable
   municipalities, in terms of acquired social status, are positively
   associated with the damage caused by the disaster. We have confirmed the
   intersection of physical and social vulnerability levels, and most
   socially vulnerable societies live in areas of high physical
   vulnerability. This research reinforces the idea that disasters are the
   result of an interaction between physical and social vulnerabilities,
   and the importance of understanding the different impact of hazardous
   events is crucial to reducing the negative impact of natural disasters
   in Algeria and globally.}},

   cultivars}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{273}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Apples (Malus x domestica Borkh.) are an economically important crop in
   many temperate growing regions around the world. Apple being
   characterized by gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) requires
   cross-pollination with compatible apple pollen during bloom to achieve
   sufficient fruit set for commercial production. For this reason, in
   commercial orchards it is common practice to plant pollinizer trees,
   which can be either crabapples or different apple cultivars, at a
   density of 5-10\%. Crabapple trees, in addition to their ornamental
   traits, are valued as a source of genetic diversity for pollinating
   apple orchards. The genetics underlying cross-compatible responses among
   crabapples and domesticated apples, especially recently released
   cultivars, have been largely understudied. In this study, we
   characterized one novel S-RNase allele from the crabapple Malus
   `Doubloons', named S59, and report an allele-specific PCR method for
   detection of this allele from genomic DNA. Further, we characterized the
   self-incompatibility genotypes (S-genotypes) of over twenty previously
   unreported Malus accessions, including some recent releases from the
   breeding programs of the University of Minnesota and Washington State
   University. The results of this work aim to provide new information
   about cross-compatibility of cultivars and pollinizers and may be used
   to aid parent selection in apple breeding programs, as well as
   pollinizer selection for the commercial orchard.}},

Journal = {{PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{170-186}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the reproductive biology of the invasive
   nitrogen-fixing shrub Elaeagnus umbellata. Hand-pollination experiments
   and pollinator-exclusion experiments were performed in four Illinois,
   U.S.A. populations to determine the breeding system of E. umbellata, and
   floral visitors were collected to determine pollinators in the invasive
   range. Although self-compatibility is a trait shown to confer
   invasiveness, our experiments revealed that E. umbellata is a mostly
   outcrossing species with a self-incompatible breeding system. Variation
   does exist in that a small percentage of individuals allow
   self-fertilization through autogamy. There is also variability among
   plants in the separation of male and female floral parts that may
   further affect selfing potential. The majority of floral visitors to E.
   umbellata were generalist pollinators, including bees, flies, and moths.
   Many of the larger insect visitors are pollinators of E. umbellata based
   on analysis of pollen on insect specimens, but smaller insects do not
   pollinate as frequently. Its ability to attract generalist pollinators
   means that E. umbellata will produce fruit wherever pollinators and
   mates occur; however, the low fruit set on open-pollinated branches
   contrasts with the idea of a prolifically fruiting plant. E. umbellata

Abstract = {{A contemporary synthesis of polymeric nanocarriers based on drug
   delivery systems was employed using a water in oil in water (W-1/O/W-2)
   double emulsion process to develop nicardipine hydrochloride-loaded
   carboxymethyl cellulose/poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (NCH-CMC/PLGA)
   nanocarriers. The optimal synthesis of the nanocarriers was studied,
   including polymer amount, cross-linker concentration, and emulsifier
   concentration. The synthesized nanocarriers were smaller than similar to
   169 nm and showed a drug encapsulation of more than 80\% and a yield of
   51\% to 73\%. The NCH-CMC/PLGA nanocarriers presented good stability in
   aqueous dispersion for 10 days. Controlled drug release from the
   nanocarriers was slow and continuous for up to 16 days. The nanocarriers
   protected the drug against degradation and maintained therapeutic drug
   concentrations. In addition, the transport of drug release was studied
   via five conventional mathematical modelings such as Zero-order model,
   First-order model, Hixson-Crowell model, Higuchi model, and
   Korsmeyer-Peppas model. The Korsmeyer-Peppas model was fitted to achieve
   mathematical modeling for the optimized formulation of nanocarriers.
   Moreover, significant cytocompatibility was observed at all tested doses
   of NCH-CMC/PLGA nanocarriers. The NCH-CMC/PLGA nanocarriers could be an
   effective drug delivery agent for calcium channel blockers.}},

Abstract = {{South Africa is a country overwhelmed by crime and violence, with very
   high incidences of abuse against women and children. It is not often
   that a case of intimate partner homicide is seen in a forensic
   anthropological context. Here, we report on such a case where the
   remains of the victim had been buried for some time. The victim was a
   middle-aged female, while the suspect was a younger adult male. The
   deceased had suffered massive, repeated trauma during her lifetime with
   healed fractures and evidence of soft tissue trauma to virtually all
   parts of her body. A partly healed rib fracture indicates that the abuse
   continued until shortly before her death. She ultimately succumbed after
   suffering trauma to her head and face after reportedly being hit by a
   brick, evidence of which can be seen as perimortem fractures of the
   face. It is important for forensic anthropologists to identify specific
   patterns and report on the presence of healed fractures, as they can
   raise suspicion as to the possibility of chronic abuse. In this case,
   the evidence suggests a very long period of extreme and repeated trauma,
   which were apparently not reported or noticed by family members or the
   medical fraternity.}},

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{729-742}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. With evidence of significant global insect declines mounting, urgent
   calls to mitigate such declines are also increasing. Efforts to reverse
   insect declines will only succeed, however, if we correctly identify and
   address their major causes.
   2. One potential cause that has received little mention is the global
   spread of non-native plants as invasive species, agroforestry products,
   and ornamental plants.
   3. Here we (a) review the theory predicting that most insect herbivores
   are evolutionarily constrained to use a fraction of available plant
   lineages; (b) document the extent to which nonnative plants have
   displaced native plant communities around the globe; (c) examine the
   evidence that non-native plants reduce insect abundance and diversity;
   and (d) suggest guidelines for measuring the impact of non-native plants
   on insect populations.
   4. We conclude that host range expansions to non-natives do occur among
   many insect herbivores but not at the frequency required to prevent
   insect declines when non-native plants replace native plant communities.
   Accordingly, we suggest that curbing the spread and use of non- native
   plants at local, national, and international scales will be a necessary
   and effective way to reduce some insect declines.}},

Journal = {{BIG DATA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Firms face challenging analytical tasks at the advent of a growing
   amount of unstructured big data (BD). These data lead to radical shifts
   in their analytical strategies and market insights. Yet, the particular
   types of analytical methods remain in the literature still loosely
   scattered. This work stresses the unstructured BD analytics, first by
   capturing their unique characteristics and then by proposing a model for
   diagnosis of the analytical methods related to unstructured data (UD)
   inside the firms. We focus on five interrelated research aspects, by:
   explaining the essence of UD with the firms' environment; identifying
   and classifying the most important analytical methods in organizations
   to better understand UD; developing a conceptual model along with
   measures; and diagnosing the extent to which the unstructured analytical
   methods, beside the structured analytics, relate with firm performance
   (FP). Finally, this model is investigated from perspective of the
   two-communities theory in reference to data scientists and marketing
   researchers within the organizational environment. A model is tested on
   the basis of complementary analytical strategies: confirmatory and
   multigroup factor analyses and structural equation modeling, for which
   data (N = 356) were collected from international online survey. Results
   confirm a high level of adequacy of the conceptual model and superiority
   of unstructured over the structured analytics leading to FP, while the
   scalar invariance testing proves minor differences between groups in
   reference to two of the analytical methods.}},

Abstract = {{Compared with the organic electrolyte, the solid electrolyte is more
   stable and non-volatile at high potential, which solves the
   decomposition problem of organic electrolyte and the potential safety
   hazard of flammability and explosion. Based on the advantages of
   inorganic solid electrolyte and polymer solid electrolyte, a
   ceramic/polyurethane composite polymer electrolyte (CPPE) based on
   Li0.35La0.55TiO3 (LLTO) and polyurethane (LPU) was prepared in this
   work. First, a linear polyurethane (LPU) was synthesized via 2,4-toluene
   diisocyanate (TDI) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPO), owing to the high
   ionic conductivity of LLTO and good mechanical property of LPU. The CPPE
   has a satisfactory lithium ion conductivity (3.8 x 10(-4) S cm(-1)) at
   room temperature. Furthermore, the assembled LiFePO4|CPPE|Li battery
   exhibit excellent cycle performance at room temperature, the discharge
   capacity was still 149.8 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles and with a superior
   capacity retention of 97.8\% at 0.5 degrees C. Additionally, the
   LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2|CPPE|Li exhibited remarkable rate capacity that the
   initial capacity reached to 216.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 degrees C and
   maintains the excellent specific capacity of 138 mAh g(-1) at 1 degrees
   C. These findings suggest that CPPE provides a viable idea for the
   development of high-performance lithium batteries.}},

Title = {{Resummation of the Holstein-Primakoff expansion and differential
   equation approach to operator square roots}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Operator square roots are ubiquitous in theoretical physics. They
   appear, for example, in the Holstein-Primakoff representation of spin
   operators and in the Klein-Gordon equation. Often the use of a
   perturbative expansion is the only recourse when dealing with them. In
   this paper, we show that under certain conditions, differential
   equations can be derived which can be used to find perturbatively
   inaccessible approximations to operator square roots. Specifically, for
   the number operator (n) over cap = a(dagger)a we show that the square
   root root(n) over cap near (n) over cap = 0 can be approximated by a
   polynomial in (n) over cap. This result is unexpected because a Taylor
   expansion fails. A polynomial expression in (n) over cap is possible
   because (n) over cap is an operator, and its constituents a and
   a(dagger) have a non trivial commutator {[}a, a(dagger)] = 1 and do not
   behave as scalars. We apply our approach to the zero-mass Klein-Gordon
   Hamiltonian in a constant magnetic field and, as a main application, the
   Holstein-Primakoff representation of spin operators, where we are able
   to find new expressions that are polynomial in bosonic operators. We
   prove that these new expressions exactly reproduce spin operators. Our
   expressions are manifestly Hermitian, which offers an advantage over
   other methods, such as the Dyson-Maleev representation.}},

Title = {{Impact of Smoking Status on Growth Differentiation Factor 15 and
   Mortality in Patients With Suspected or Known Coronary Artery Disease:
   The ANOX Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Whether circulating growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) levels
   differ according to smoking status and whether smoking modifies the
   relationship between GDF-15 and mortality in patients with coronary
   artery disease are unclear.
   Methods and Results
   Using data from a multicenter, prospective cohort of 2418 patients with
   suspected or known coronary artery disease, we assessed the association
   between smoking status and GDF-15 and the impact of smoking status on
   the association between GDF-15 and all-cause death. GDF-15 was measured
   in 955 never smokers, 1035 former smokers, and 428 current smokers
   enrolled in the ANOX Study (Development of Novel Biomarkers Related to
   Angiogenesis or Oxidative Stress to Predict Cardiovascular Events).
   Patients were followed up during 3 years. The age of the patients ranged
   from 19 to 94 years; 67.2\% were men. Never smokers exhibited
   significantly lower levels of GDF-15 compared with former smokers and
   current smokers. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed
   that the log-transformed GDF-15 level was independently associated with
   both current smoking and former smoking. In the entire patient cohort,
   the GDF-15 level was significantly associated with all-cause death after
   adjusting for potential clinical confounders. This association was still
   significant in never smokers, former smokers, and current smokers.
   However, GDF-15 provided incremental prognostic information to the model
   with potential clinical confounders and the established cardiovascular
   biomarkers in never smokers, but not in current smokers or in former
   smokers.
   Conclusions
   Not only current, but also former smoking was independently associated
   with higher levels of GDF-15. The prognostic value of GDF-15 on
   mortality was most pronounced in never smokers among patients with
   suspected or known coronary artery disease.}},

Abstract = {{Structural colors are widespread in myriads of natural living organisms
   measuring from tens to hundreds of nanometers. In recent years,
   amorphous photonic crystal films have received extensive attention due
   to their stable color rendering properties. However, the internal
   structure of the films is easy to be contaminated by liquid. Thus,
   self-cleaning performance has been considered as one of the main
   obstacles to the practical application of artificial structural colored
   films. In order to solve the issues, we used
   heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodacyl trimethoxysilane to modify the
   structural colored films. The results demonstrated that the modified
   colored films showed super-hydrophobic (contact angle > 160 degrees) and
   high oleophobic (contact angle > 150 degrees) properties. The rapid
   production of water-resistant and oil-resistant structural color
   coatings by spraying is significant for expanding their application in
   outdoor conditions (e.g., acid-base, alkali base, pollution) for a long
   time.}},

Title = {{Thermal Activation of Peracetic Acid in Aquatic Solution: The Mechanism
   and Application to Degrade Sulfamethoxazole}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{14635-14645}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Chemical oxidation using peracetic acid (PAA) can be enhanced by
   activation with the formation of reactive species such as organic
   radicals (R-O-center dot) and HO center dot. Thermal activation is an
   alternative way for PAA activation, which was first applied to degrade
   micropollutants in this study. PAA is easily decomposed by heat via both
   radical and nonradical pathways. Our experimental results suggest that a
   series of reactive species including R-O-center dot, HO center dot, and
   O-1(2) can be produced through the thermal decomposition of PAA.
   Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), a typical sulfa drug, can be effectively removed
   by the thermoactivated PAA process under conditions of neutral pH.
   R-O-center dot including CH3C(O)O-center dot and CH3C(O)OO center dot
   has been shown to play a primary role in the degradation of SMX followed
   by direct PAA oxidation in the thermoactivated PAA process. Both higher
   temperature (60 degrees C) and higher PAA dose benefit SMX degradation,
   while coexisting H2O2 inhibits SMX degradation in the thermoactivated
   PAA process. With a variation of solution pH, conditions near a neutral
   value show the best performance of this process in SMX degradation.
   Based on the identified intermediates, transformation of SMX was
   proposed to undergo oxidation of the amine group and oxidative coupling
   reactions. This study definitively illustrates the PAA decomposition
   pathways at high temperature in aquatic solution and addresses the
   possibility of the thermoactivated PAA process for contaminant
   destruction, demonstrating this process to be a feasible advanced
   oxidation process.}},

Abstract = {{The training of soldiers for urban conflict involves marksmanship
   instruction on outdoor flat ranges and the teaching of close-quarter
   battle techniques in indoor facilities, referred to as shoot houses,
   where intense firing exercises can generate high air lead levels from
   small arms ammunition, flash bang grenades, and explosive devices.
   Levels of lead and copper in air were evaluated during five training
   activities of a 45-day training course using both stationary general
   area and breathing zone sampling over a 2-year period. Individual blood
   lead values were determined prior to and at course completion. Mean
   breathing zone lead concentrations for the five training activities
   ranged from 0.014 on the outdoor flat range to 0.064 mg/m(3) inside
   shoot houses; with a change to lead-free ammunition the values were
   reduced to a range of 0.006-0.022 mg/m(3). Isolated flash bang grenades
   generated very high general area lead concentrations (2.0 mg/m(3)),
   which in training were associated with the highest measured breathing
   zone concentration (0.16 mg/m(3)). For copper, mean breathing zone
   concentrations increased from 0.010 to 0.037 mg/m(3) with the change to
   lead-free frangible ammunition on the outdoor range, but remained below
   the permissible exposure limit for copper fume. Inside shoot houses,
   mean breathing zone copper concentrations exceeded the permissible
   exposure limit with ball and lead-free frangible ammunition, ranging
   from 0.077-0.13 mg/m(3). With the introduction of lead-free ammunition,
   when comparing the blood lead differences between start and finish of
   the course, there was a significant reduction in the mean blood lead
   difference from 13.3 mu g/dL to 5.4 mu g/dL. Options for mitigation of
   potentially high exposure areas using improved ventilation designs are
   discussed. These results advocate for improved designs for shoot house
   training facilities, stress the importance of removing lead from
   ammunition and explosive devices for training, and promote the continued
   need for implementation of controls to mitigate and manage metal
   exposures during training.}},

Abstract = {{Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are crucial components of the tumor
   microenvironment. They play vital roles in hepatocellular carcinoma
   (HCC) progression. However, the interactions between TAMs and HCC cells
   have not been fully characterized. In this study, TAMs were induced
   using human monocytic cell line THP-1 cells in vitro to investigate
   their functions in HCC progression. S100 calcium-binding protein A9
   (S100A9), an inflammatory microenvironment-related secreted protein, was
   identified to be significantly upregulated in TAMs. S100A9 expression in
   tumor tissues was associated with poor survival of HCC patients. It
   could enhance the stem cell-like properties of HepG2 and MHCC-97H cells
   by activating nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway through advanced
   glycosylation end product-specific receptor in a Ca2+-dependent manner.
   Furthermore, we found that, after treatment with S100A9, HepG2 and
   MHCC-97H cells recruited more macrophages via chemokine (C-C motif)
   ligand 2, which suggests a positive feedback between TAMs and HCC cells.
   Taken together, our findings reveal that TAMs could upregulate secreted
   protein S100A9 and enhance the stem cell-like properties of HCC cells
   and provide a potential therapeutic target for combating HCC.}},

   Base-catalyzed aldol condensation of 1 resulted in the formation of

   3-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-ol {[}MCP (3)] by chemoselective reduction with
   a ternary Ru catalyst system {[}RuCl2(PPh3)(3)/NH2(CH2)(2)NH2/KOH]. The

   dehydrated over AlPO4/MgSO4 at 70 degrees C under reduced pressure to
   yield 4, which can undergo an ambient temperature {[}4+2]-Diels-Alder

Abstract = {{Silica rods with homogeneous (hydrophilic or hydrophobic) and
   amphiphilic surface properties were synthesized and their efficiencies
   in suppressing the flow-induced droplet coalescence of immiscible
   polyisobutylene (PIB)/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) blends were evaluated
   via in situ visualization technique. The flow-induced coalescence
   behavior of blends was found to strongly depend on the surface nature
   and concentration of silica rods added as well as the blend ratio. While
   a trace amount of rods promoted coalescence, all kinds of rods
   demonstrated a morphology refinement effect at high rod concentrations.
   Good compatibilization effects were obtained at high rod concentrations,
   especially for hydrophilic and amphiphilic rods. Based on confocal laser
   scanning microscopy results, these phenomena observed were interpreted
   reasonably in terms of the selective distribution and aggregation of
   silica rods, which were suggested to be decisive for the stabilization
   mechanism and efficiency of these rods.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are one of the subtypes of
   neuroendocrine neoplasms and are defined as epithelial neoplasms with
   predominant neuroendocrine differentiation. The aim of this study was to
   clarify the clinicopathological characteristics of colorectal NETs
   through a nationwide retrospective study in Japan.
   Methods This multicenter retrospective cohort study of NETs in Japan was
   conducted by the study group of the Japanese Society for Cancer of the
   Colon and Rectum. In this study, we aimed to clarify the characteristics
   of Japanese patients with colorectal NETs. This cohort study included
   patients with colorectal NETs who were treated from January 2011 to
   December 2015.
   Results Most NETs developed in the lower rectum. Predictive factors of
   lymph node metastasis included size (>10 mm), depth of invasion
   (muscular propria or greater), NET grade (NET G2), depressed lesion of
   the tumor, and lymphovascular infiltration. In particular, depressed
   lesion of the tumor and lymphovascular infiltration were independent
   predictive factors of lymph node metastasis. The presence of an
   increased number of these predictive factors increased the lymph node
   metastasis rate.
   Conclusion Surgical resection with lymph node dissection is considered
   in the colorectal NETs patients with predictive factors of lymph node
   metastasis, the number of which is correlated with incidence of lymph
   node metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance of media options is a central feature of today's
   information environment. Many accounts, often based on analysis of
   desktop-only news use, suggest that this increased choice leads to
   audience fragmentation, ideological segregation, and echo chambers with
   no cross-cutting exposure. Contrary to many of those claims, this paper
   uses observational multiplatform data capturing both desktop and mobile
   use to demonstrate that coexposure to diverse news is on the rise, and
   that ideological self-selection does not explain most of that
   coexposure. We show that mainstream media outlets offer the common
   ground where ideologically diverse audiences converge online, though our
   analysis also reveals that more than half of the US online population
   consumes no online news, underlining the risk of increased information
   inequality driven by self-selection along lines of interest. For this
   study, we use an unprecedented combination of observed data from the
   United States comprising a 5-y time window and involving tens of
   thousands of panelists. Our dataset traces news consumption across
   different devices and unveils important differences in news diets when
   multiplatform or desktop-only access is used. We discuss the
   implications of our findings for how we think about the current
   communication environment, exposure to news, and ongoing attempts to
   limit the effects of misinformation.}},

Abstract = {{A new method for increasing the interface resistance between geopolymer
   coating and concrete lining structure without applying the organic
   binder was suggested in this study. Parallel grooves with different
   depths and orientations were milled on the top surface of concrete
   block, and well-blended geopolymer mixture (Na-PSS type geopolymer:
   Sodium poly-sialate-siloxo) was coated upon the grooved interface. The
   wedge splitting (WS) experiments were conducted to compare the interface
   adhesion capacity of specimens with different groove width/depth ratios
   and groove orientations. The average energy release rate (ERR) was
   calculated by integrating the P-v-CMOD diagram to quantify the
   interfacial fracture toughness. To understand the interface strength
   mechanisms and the fracture mode at the front crack mouth, franc 3D
   simulation was carried out to segregate the mixed fracture mode to
   determine the initial pure stress intensity factors (K-I,K-II,K-III) at
   the crack mouth. Both the experiments and simulation results indicated
   that the highest interface fracture toughness was reached by the double
   diagonal parallel grooves with 0.375 width/depth ratio. These findings
   put forward a promising attaching method for efficient and reliable
   passive fire protection coating, with the aim of decreasing the risk of
   layer delamination in highway tunnels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the visual quality of the adversarial examples.
   Recent papers propose to smooth the perturbations to get rid of high
   frequency artifacts. In this work, smoothing has a different meaning as
   it perceptually shapes the perturbation according to the visual content
   of the image to be attacked. The perturbation becomes locally smooth on
   the flat areas of the input image, but it may be noisy on its textured
   areas and sharp across its edges.This operation relies on Laplacian
   smoothing, well-known in graph signal processing, which we integrate in
   the attack pipeline. We benchmark several attacks with and without
   smoothing under a white box scenario and evaluate their transferability.
   Despite the additional constraint of smoothness, our attack has the same
   probability of success at lower distortion.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This study aimed to develop two-stage nomogram models to predict

   pregnancies by incorporating clinical characteristics at mid-gestation.
   Methods We used a case-control study design of women with twin
   pregnancies followed up in a tertiary medical centre from January 2018
   to March 2019. Maternal demographic characteristics and transvaginal
   cervical length data were extracted. The nomogram models were
   constructed with independent variables determined by multivariate
   logistic regression analyses. The risk score was calculated based on the
   nomogram models. Results In total, 65 twin preterm birth cases (< 34
   weeks) and 244 controls met the inclusion criteria. Based on univariate
   and multivariate logistic regression analyses, we built two-stage
   nomogram prediction models with satisfactory discrimination and
   calibration when applied to the validation sets (first-stage {[}22-24
   weeks] prediction model, C-index: 0.805 and 0.870, respectively;
   second-stage {[}26-28 weeks] prediction model, C-index: 0.847 and 0.908,
   respectively). Restricted cubic splines graphically showed the risk of
   preterm birth among individuals with increased risk scores. Moreover,
   the decision curve analysis indicated that both prediction models show
   positive clinical benefit. Conclusion We developed and validated
   two-stage nomogram models at mid-gestation to predict the individual
   probability of preterm birth at < 34 weeks in twin pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{Copolymerization of ethylene (E) and halogenated styrenes is screened by
   half-sandwich scandium catalyst 1 and constrained geometry scandium
   catalysts 2 4. The methyl-substituted N-heterocyclic carbene fluorenyl
   catalyst 3 initiates the E copolymerization with para-fluorostyrene
   (pFSt), para-chlorostyrene (pClSt) and para-bromostyrene (pBrSt) to
   pseudo-random copolymers with an incorporation level of up to 46.3
   mol\%, 45.1 mol\% and 37.5 mol\%, respectively. Increasing reaction
   temperatures from 20 to 60 degrees C results in an increment of E/pFSt
   copolymerization activity from 5.64 x 10(5) to 8.10 x 10(5) g
   mol(Sc)(-1)h(-1). In contrast, a higher temperature dramatically
   depresses the E/pClSt copolymerization (4.86 x 10(5) g mol(Sc)(-1)h(-1)
   at 20 degrees C vs 0.90 x 10(5) g mol(Sc)(-1)h(-1) at 60 degrees C). At
   20 degrees C, the E/pBrSt copolymerization only affords a little pure
   polyethylene, and the E-pBrSt copolymer with 37.5 mol\% pBrSt is
   obtained at 0 degrees C. The pseudo-random copolymers of E and
   halogenated styrenes give one glass transition temperature and
   decomposition temperature on DSC and TGA curves.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To investigate the clinical efficacy of 0.01\% atropine in
   slowing the progression of myopia in children and to evaluate the
   influence of 0.01\% atropine on secretion of basal tear and stability of
   tear film. Methods Eighty children aged 5-14 years with myopia, 40 were
   randomly divided into two groups consisting of those who received
   spectacles in addition to 0.01\% atropine (SA group) and those who
   received only spectacles (S group). The remaining 40 children who were
   wearing orthokeratology (OK) lenses for 3 months were randomly divided
   into two groups comprising those who received OK lenses in addition to
   0.01\% atropine (OKA group) and those who received only OK lenses (OK
   group). Comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations, including slit-lamp
   examination, visual acuity testing, autorefraction, intraocular
   pressure, axial length (AL), corneal topography, Schirmer's test, and
   tear film break-up time (TBuT), were performed before treatment and
   after every 3 months treatment. Results During the follow-up visits,
   evidently better spherical equivalent (SE) control over 3, 6 and 12
   months was observed in the SA and OKA groups compared with the S and OK
   groups. The AL over 3, 6, and 12 months was evidently inhibited in the
   SA and OKA groups compared with the S and OK groups. No statistically
   significant differences in Schirmer's test and TBuT results were
   observed between the S and SA groups and between the OK and OKA groups.
   However, statistically significant differences were found in TBuT
   results between before treatment and after 3 months treatment in the OK
   group (P < 0.05, paired t test) and the OKA group (P < 0.05, paired t
   test). Conclusions 0.01\% atropine can effectively control myopia
   progression and axial elongation regardless of combined treatment with
   spectacles or OK lenses. And 0.01\% atropine has no evident effect on
   Schirmer's test and TBuT results; however, researchers also found that
   Schirmer's test and TBuT results showed a tendency to reduce after
   treatment with 0.01\% atropine.}},

Abstract = {{Searching for high-efficiency nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalysts
   for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction
   (OER) is paramount for the advancement of water electrolysis

   electronic structure of an electrocatalyst via heterointerface
   engineering represents an efficient strategy to improve its
   electrocatalytic performance. Herein, a feasible hydrothermal synthesis
   of a novel heterostructured catalyst was demonstrated, comprising CoS2
   nanocubes and vertically aligned MoS2 nanosheet arrays directly grown on
   flexible and conductive carbon cloth (CC) substrate (denoted as
   CoS2/MoS2@CC). Thanks to the elaborate interface engineering and
   vertically aligned nanosheet arrayed architecture, the resultant
   self-supported CoS2/MoS2@CC electrode possessed enriched exposed active
   sites, modulated electronic configuration, multidimensional mass
   transport channels, and outstanding mechanical strength, thereby
   affording exceptional electrocatalytic performances towards the HER and
   OER in alkaline electrolyte with overpotentials of 71 and 274 mV at 10
   mA cm(-2), respectively. In addition, a two-electrode electrolyzer
   assembled by CoS2/MoS2@CC required a cell voltage of 1.59 V at 10 mA
   cm(-2) with nearly 100 \% faradaic efficiency and remarkable durability,
   showing great potential for scalable and economical water electrolysis.}},

Title = {{Comparison of Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery and

   Glaucoma}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. To compare femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS)
   versus conventional phacoemulsification in shallow anterior chamber
   cataract patients with glaucoma or zonulysis. Methods. This was a
   single-center retrospective review of cataract surgeries in shallow
   anterior chamber and glaucoma patients between January 2016 and December
   2018 in which a LenSx femtosecond laser was used. The outcome measures
   included pre- and postoperative uncorrected and corrected distance
   visual acuity (UDVA and CDVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), endothelial
   cell density (ECD), endothelial cell loss (ECL), and object scatter
   index (OSI). Results. One hundred and six eyes of 106 patients with a
   mean anterior chamber depth of 1.54 +/- 0.51 mm were included in this
   study. Among them, 26 (23.2\%) had zonulysis and 18 eyes had capsular
   tension ring implantation in general. The percentage of capsular tension
   ring implantation was statistically significantly lower in the FLACS
   group (P = 0.027). The UDVA, CDVA, ECD, and IOP were not statistically
   significant between the two groups at all time points. The postoperative
   ECL and OSI of the FLACS group was better than those of the conventional
   group (P < 0.01). Conclusions. FLACS can reduce ECL and improve visual
   quality compared to the conventional phacoemulsification in shallow
   anterior chamber patients. Also, it has the trend of reducing the use of
   capsular tension rings in subluxated cataracts. It is an ideal choice
   for patients with complicated cataract such as with shallow anterior
   chambers, glaucoma, and zonulysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this case study, the author showcases a Mexican teen's testimonios,
   crossing borders through poetry and art. The author grounds this work
   within Anzaldua's nepantla (in-between space) and nepantlera border
   artist notions and draws from Sepulveda's pedagogy of acompanamiento
   (accompaniment). During a larger project, the author, a former teacher,
   reunited with former elementary students the summer before 10th grade.
   The author focuses on one participant, Valeria, and her nepantlera
   border artist empathy, revealing her embodied experiences over time. The
   author seeks to show how acompanamiento coupled with testimonios creates
   apertures across time. Implications include a teacher's acompanamiento
   in establishing creative nepantla spaces outside of traditional
   educational structures. This fosters confianza (trust) to express
   testimonios, uncovering a holistic understanding of students' lives.
   Testimonios in this study promote healing, empowerment, and
   transformation amid various modalities for students in the educational
   system, creatively enhancing teachers' literacy instruction.}},

Title = {{Ellagic acid alleviates clozapine-induced oxidative stress and
   mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiomyocytes}},
Journal = {{DRUG AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Clozapine (CLZ) as an antipsychotic agent is very effective in treating
   of psychosis disorders and resistant schizophrenia, but the risk of
   severe cardiac toxicity effects restricts its clinical use. There are
   several interrelated hypotheses to explain clozapine-induced
   cardiotoxicity which all of them may be related to oxidative stress.
   Therefore, the current study investigated the harmful effects of
   clozapine on cardiomyocytes and assessed the cytoprotective effect of
   ellagic acid (EA). Freshly isolated adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes
   were incubated for 4 h at 37 degrees C with 00.05\% ethanol as control,
   CLZ (50 mu M), CLZ (50 mu M) + a series of EA concentrations (10, 20 and
   50 mu M) and EA (50 mu M). To evaluate the protective effect of EA, the
   markers of cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation,
   mitochondria membrane potential (Delta psi m) collapse, lysosomal
   membrane integrity, malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidized/reduced
   glutathione (GSH/GSSG) content were checked by biochemical and
   flowcytometry techniques. Our results demonstrated that EA (10, 20 and
   50 mu M) effectively inhibited CLZ-induced cytotoxicity which is
   associated with ROS overproduction and amelioration of mitochondrial and
   lysosomal damages. In addition, EA (10, 20 and 50 mu M) in the presence
   of CLZ reduced the production of MDA as a specific marker lipid
   peroxidation and GSSG. Collectively, these findings suggested that EA
   protects cardiomyocytes from oxidative injury through inhibiting ROS
   formation, mitochondria dysfunction, and lysosomal damages, which
   suggest a potential therapeutic strategy of EA for CLZ-induced oxidative
   stress and cardiotoxicity.}},

Journal = {{SURFACE AND INTERFACE ANALYSIS}},
Abstract = {{The ability of titanium dioixide to split water into OH- and H+ species
   is heavily dependent on the behaviour of defects in the crystal
   structure at or near the surface. We present an in situ study of defect
   migration in rutile TiO2(110) conducted using X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS). First, surface and subsurface defects were created
   in the crystal by argon ion sputtering. Subsequent in situ exposure of
   the defective crystal to liquid water healed the surface defects,
   whereas the subsurface remained defective. The sample was then annealed
   while XPS was used to monitor the concentration of titanium defects. At
   low annealing temperatures, Ti3+ was observed to migrate from the
   subsurface to the surface. Further annealing gradually restored the
   surface and subsurface to the defect-free Ti4+ form, during which the
   changes in abundance of Ti1+, Ti2+ and Ti3+ defects are discussed.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to investigate the influence of chronic ischemia on
   nitric oxide biosynthesis in the bladder and the effect of administering
   tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor for endothelial nitric oxide
   synthase (eNOS), on chronic ischemia-related lower urinary tract
   dysfunction (LUTD). This study divided male Sprague-Dawley rats into
   Control, chronic bladder ischemia (CBI) and CBI with oral BH4
   supplementation (CBI/BH4) groups. In the CBI group, bladder capacity and
   bladder muscle strip contractility were significantly lower, and
   arterial wall was significantly thicker than in Controls. Significant
   improvements were seen in bladder capacity, muscle strip contractility
   and arterial wall thickening in the CBI/BH4 group as compared with the
   CBI group. Western blot analysis of bladder showed expressions of eNOS
   (p=0.043), HIF-1 alpha (p<0.01) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)
   (p<0.01), which could regenerate BH4, were significantly higher in the
   CBI group than in Controls. In the CBI/BH4 group, HIF-1 alpha (p=0.012)
   and DHFR expressions (p=0.018) were significantly decreased compared

   eNOS and DHFR in the bladder to prevent atherosclerosis progression.
   However, DHFR could not synthesize sufficient BH4 relative to the
   increased eNOS, resulting in LUTD. BH4 supplementation protects lower

Abstract = {{Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play an important role in the total annual
   precipitation regionally and globally, delivering precious freshwater to
   many arid/semiarid regions. On the other hand, they may cause intense
   precipitation and floods with huge socioeconomic effects worldwide. In
   this study, we investigate AR-related precipitation using 18 years
   (2001-2018) of globally gridded AR locations derived from Modern-Era
   Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2
   (MERRA-2). AR precipitation features are explored regionally and
   seasonally using remote sensing (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals
   for GPM version 6 {[}IMERG V6], daily Global Precipitation Climatology
   Project version 1.3 {[}GPCP V1.3], bias-adjusted CPC Morphing Technique
   version 1 {[}CMORPH V1], and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely
   Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks {[}PERSIANN-CDR])
   and reanalysis (MERRA-2 and ECMWF Reanalysis 5th Generation {[}ERA5])
   precipitation products. The results show that most of the world (except
   the tropics) experience more intense precipitation from AR-related
   events compared to non-AR events. Over the oceans (especially the
   Southern Ocean), the contribution of ARs to the total precipitation and
   extreme events is larger than over land. However, some coastal areas
   over land are highly affected by ARs (e.g., the western and eastern
   United States and Canada, Western Europe, North Africa, and part of the
   Middle East, East Asia, and eastern South America and part of
   Australia). Although spatial correlations for pairs of IMERG/CMORPH and
   GPCP/PERSIANN-CDR are fairly high, considerable discrepancies are shown
   in their estimation of AR-related events (i.e., overall IMERG and CMORPH
   show a higher fraction of AR-related precipitation). It was found that
   the degree of consistency between reanalysis and satellite-based
   products is highly regionally dependent, partly due to the uneven
   distribution of in situ measurements.}},

Title = {{Comparison of different anticoagulation strategies for renal replacement
   therapy in critically ill patients with COVID-19: a cohort study}},
Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Background Critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients
   have a high risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) that requires renal
   replacement therapy (RRT). A state of hypercoagulability reduces circuit
   life spans. To maintain circuit patency and therapeutic efficiency, an
   optimized anticoagulation strategy is needed. This study investigates
   whether alternative anticoagulation strategies for RRT during COVID-19
   are superior to administration of unfractionated heparin (UFH). Methods
   Retrospective cohort study on 71 critically ill COVID-19 patients (>= 18
   years), admitted to intensive care units at a tertiary health care
   facility in the southwestern part of Germany between February 26 and May
   21, 2020. We collected data on the disease course, AKI, RRT, and
   thromboembolic events. Four different anticoagulatory regimens were
   administered. Anticoagulation during continuous veno-venous hemodialysis
   (CVVHD) was performed with UFH or citrate. Anticoagulation during
   sustained low-efficiency daily dialysis (SLEDD) was performed with UFH,
   argatroban, or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Primary outcome is
   the effect of the anticoagulation regimen on mean treatment times of
   RRT. Results In patients receiving CVVHD, mean treatment time in the UFH
   group was 21.3 h (SEM: +/- 5.6 h), in the citrate group 45.6 h (SEM: +/-
   2.7 h). Citrate anticoagulation significantly prolonged treatment times
   by 24.4 h (P = .001). In patients receiving SLEDD, mean treatment time
   with UFH was 8.1 h (SEM: +/- 1.3 h), with argatroban 8.0 h (SEM: +/- 0.9
   h), and with LMWH 11.8 h (SEM: +/- 0.5 h). LMWH significantly prolonged
   treatment times by 3.7 h (P = .008) and 3.8 h (P = .002), respectively.
   Conclusions UFH fails to prevent early clotting events in the dialysis
   circuit during COVID-19. For patients, who do not require effective
   systemic anticoagulation, regional citrate dialysis is the most
   effective strategy. For patients, who require effective systemic
   anticoagulation, the usage of LMWH results in the longest circuit life
   spans. The proposed anticoagulatory strategies are safe, can easily be
   monitored, and allow an individualized treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Latinx youth experience disparities in the availability of and
   participation in evidence-based interventions to reduce hazardous
   alcohol use. The aim of this secondary data analysis was to examine
   whether Project Options, a brief, evidence-based alcohol use
   intervention was beneficial for Latinx participants. A total of 331
   first-, second-, and third-generation immigrant Latina and Latino youth
   who participated in a multi-site, hybrid effectiveness/efficacy clinical
   trial of the intervention were selected for analyses. Mixed-effects
   growth models tested changes in drinking cognitions (i.e., perception of
   peer drinking, intention to drink next month, alcohol use and cessation
   expectancies) and behaviors (i.e., number of past-month drinking days,
   average number of drinks per occasion, and maximum number of drinks per
   occasion) across three time points (i.e., baseline, 4-weeks, and
   12-weeks). Consistent with prior Project Options studies, participants
   with more drinking experience reported greater decreases in perception
   of peer drinking, intentions to drink next month, and all drinking
   behaviors than those with less experience. While no changes were
   observed in expectancies, first-generation participants endorsed lower
   positive use expectancies than second- and third-generation youth as
   well as more favorable cessation expectancies than third-generation
   teens. In concert with prior studies demonstrating the intervention's
   success in recruitment and retention of Latinx participants, results
   suggest that Project Options might be a promising school-based
   intervention for Latinx youth. This intervention has the potential to
   reach adolescents who might otherwise not participate in traditional
   programming and help decrease disparities in availability of
   evidence-based practices for Latinx youth.}},

Abstract = {{The normal range for pH in the human body is 7.35-7.45. When pH falls
   below 7.3, it is considered as severe acidemia. Acidemia, together with
   increased blood lactate concentrations (hyperlactatemia) constitute a
   severe threat to life, which is often referred to as lactic acidosis.
   The feasibility of near infrared transmission/reflectance spectroscopy
   as a tool to determine lactate concentration levels and pH,
   independently, has been well established. However, the effects on
   spectral features arising from simultaneous variations in pH and lactate
   are not fully understood. Hence, this paper reports on a spectroscopic
   study of 37 different lactate concentrations that were prepared at three
   different pH levels (7.4, 7.0 and 6.5). Near infrared spectra were
   acquired in the range 800-2500 nm, and were later divided into four
   spectral ranges. Further investigations were carried out on various
   wavelengths within each spectral range and sample set. Furthermore,
   partial least squares regression with cross-validation was performed on
   all data sets. The results showed a clear interdependence and
   overlapping spectral behavior between blood lactate concentrations and
   pH. The findings from this study suggest that for an accurate estimation
   of blood lactate using this technique, the pH of the sample must be
   previously known.}},

Abstract = {{Many large and industrial cities all around the world suffer from
   out-migration. It is usually connected with a loss of qualified labour
   force, suboptimal use of housing and city infrastructure, decrease in
   investments, etc., resulting in limited development potential. This
   article investigates the importance of urban environmental
   quality-especially pollution-for potential out-migration. In addition,
   it brings two innovative aspects to earlier studies on environmental
   migration: (a) exploring the influence of subjective perception of
   pollution, not only its objective level (corresponding to the theory of
   planned behaviour), (b) examining the different migration strategies
   instead of one binomial `stay or leave' strategy. A representative
   sample of 3845 individuals from the city of Ostrava, Czech Republic (the
   third largest city in the country), which ranks among cities with the
   most polluted air in the Europe, was used for this purpose. The results
   suggest that (a) both the quality of natural environment and its
   subjective perception represent important and highly significant
   predictors of out-migration intentions, (b) different kinds of pollution
   lead to different migration strategies, (c) drain of young and educated
   workers is further strengthened by low quality of the natural
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature has numerous effects on the structure and dynamics of
   ecological communities. Yet, there is no general trend or consensus on
   the magnitude and directions of these effects. To fill this gap, we
   propose a mechanistic framework based on key biological rates that
   predicts how temperature influences biomass distribution and trophic
   control in food webs. We show that these predictions arise from thermal
   mismatches between biological rates and across trophic levels. We couple
   our theory with experimental data for a wide range of species and find
   that warming should lead to top-heavier terrestrial food chains and
   stronger top-down control in aquatic environments. We then derive
   predictions for the effects of temperature on herbivory and validate
   them with data on stream grazers. Our study provides a mechanistic
   explanation of thermal effects on consumer-resource systems which is
   crucial to better understand the biogeography and the consequences of
   global warming on trophic dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{EU health policy is a policy forged in crisis. Whilst maintaining the
   strict limitations on the EU's role that are described in the treaties,
   crises have historically been followed by incremental but integrative
   policy change. Given this trend, should we be expecting a radical
   expansion of EU health policy in the aftermath of Covid-19? And, if so,
   what parameters and characteristics might this new agenda have? As we
   enter the period in which the EU will try to elaborate its new health
   policy, this paper uses a Complexity perspective to assess how the
   emerging agenda compares to existing and historical EU action on health,
   the kind of decision-making that we are likely to see in the different
   areas of action, and the limitations of EU health policy development as
   it pushes into more political and complex areas of policy.}},

Abstract = {{Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are a family of bacterial enzymes
   that are key components of cell-wall biosynthesis and the target of
   beta-lactam antibiotics. Most microbial pathogens contain multiple
   structurally homologous PBP isoforms, making it difficult to target
   individual PBPs. To study the roles and regulation of specific PBP
   isoforms, a panel of bioorthogonal beta-lactone probes was synthesized
   and compared. Fluorescent labeling confirmed selectivity, and PBPs were
   selectively enriched from Streptococcus pneumoniae lysates. Comparisons
   between fluorescent labeling of probes revealed that the accessibility
   of bioorthogonal reporter molecules to the bound probe in the native
   protein environment exerts a more significant effect on labeling
   intensity than the bioorthogonal reaction used, observations that are
   likely applicable beyond this class of probes or proteins. Selective,
   bioorthogonal activity-based probes for PBPs will facilitate the
   activity-based determination of the roles and regulation of specific PBP
   isoforms, a key gap in knowledge that has yet to be filled.}},

Abstract = {{Gratitude was racialized in Victorian culture. Drawing on a wide
   historical framework, which takes in eighteenth-century proslavery
   arguments as well as twenty-first-century anti-immigrant discourses, I
   explore how Victorian-era texts placed demands upon enslaved, formerly
   enslaved, and colonized peoples to feel thankful for their treatment as
   British imperial subjects. My article ranges over contexts and academic
   debates, and surveys nineteenth-century discourses, but it coheres
   around a case study concerning media reportage of the brief residence of
   a young West African, Eyo Ekpenyon Eyo II, in Colwyn Bay, Wales, in
   1893. In a contextual examination of the press reaction to Eyo's
   decision to abandon his British schooling, this article draws attention
   to the implicit, submerged inequalities, exemplified in the demand for
   gratitude, through which Victorian Britain articulated the affective
   qualities of white hegemony.}},

Journal = {{BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY}},
Abstract = {{Torrefaction is a process of mild pyrolysis at 200-300 degrees C under
   nitrogen atmosphere and has been considered to be an effective way to
   improve the properties of biomass. In this study, lignin was subjected
   to torrefaction at 200 degrees C, 230 degrees C, 260 degrees C, and 290
   degrees C. Thermogravimetric analysis of lignin samples was performed at
   a temperature ramp of 25 to 550 degrees C with the heating rates of 10,
   20, 30, or 40 degrees C min(-1). A distributed activation energy model
   was used to analyze the pyrolysis kinetics of lignin. Then, the lignin
   samples were subjected to pyrolysis at 600 degrees C for 10 s. The
   results showed that torrefaction had a significant effect on the
   physicochemical properties and pyrolysis characteristics of lignin.
   Among the torrefied samples, the sample treated at 290 degrees C
   exhibited the lowest mass yield (86.07\%), lowest energy yield
   (93.25\%), highest content of carbon (63.76\%), highest higher heating
   value (25.18 MJ kg(-1)), and lowest content of oxygen (30.25\%). The
   activation energy of torrefied lignin samples slightly changed in
   comparison with those of the raw samples. Torrefaction has a significant
   effect on pyrolysis products. The peak area \% of S-type (41.4\%) and
   P-type (5.4\%) phenols in the bio-oil obtained by pyrolysis of LN-200
   was the highest.}},

Abstract = {{In general, the certified pathways for the production of sustainable
   aviation fuels (SAFs) are still far from being competitive with fossil
   kerosene, although they have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions. However, the mitigation costs related to SAFs and how
   they compete with the carbon credits market remain unclear. The present
   study addressed these issues, evaluating SAF pathways based on
   hydrotreatment (HEFA process) of soybean oil, palm oil, used cooking oil
   (UCO) and beef tallow; dehydration and oligomerization of ethanol (ATJ
   technology) obtained from sugarcane, lignocellulosic residues, and steel
   off-gases; and the thermochemical conversion of lignocellulosic residues
   using the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process and hydrothermal liquefaction
   (HTL). Residue-based pathways had lower mitigation costs. Used cooking
   oil / HEFA had the lowest value (185 USD tCO(2e)(-1)), followed by the
   thermochemical conversion of forestry residues (234-263 USD
   tCO(2e)(-1)). Of the 1G pathways, SAF production from 1G sugarcane
   ethanol (SC-1G/ATJ) performed better (495 USD tCO(2e)(-1)) than
   oil-based ones. In comparison with the carbon market, the mitigation
   costs of SAFs are much higher than the current prices or even future
   ones. However, several concerns about the credibility of the emission
   units and their effective mitigation effects indicate that SAFs could
   play an important role in aviation sector goals. Considering the
   potential of supplying SAF and mitigating emissions, SC-1G/ATJ was
   suggested as a preferred alternative in the short term. Of the
   residue-based pathways, tallow / HEFA and FT of forestry residues are
   suggested as strategic alternatives. (c) 2020 The Authors. Biofuels,

Abstract = {{In this paper, I consider the term ``Advanced Maternal Age{''} (AMA),
   which appears in various avenues of information for pregnant women,
   includingmedical literature and more ``common knowledge{''} avenues of
   communication, such as government websites and online forums. I explore
   the increasingly routine use of this phrase, and I problematize its
   usual definition, to mean ``35 or older.{''} I argue that this
   definition-rather than being a neutral, medical fact-is socially
   constructed, and the number 35 is arbitrarily chosen, in a way that
   perpetuates stigma against older women and their bodies. The definition
   ignores many relevant factors for considering medical ``risk{''} and
   contributes to discourses that continue to frame pregnancy as risky,
   requiring expert surveillance and intervention. I also argue that the
   widespread use of this phrase in medical literature as well as other
   sites of discourse perpetuates the ableist idea that children with
   disabilities are undesirable or less valuable.}},

Title = {{Enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production by
   Lactobacillus brevis CRL 2013 based on carbohydrate fermentation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{333}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a non-protein amino acid that is
   widely distributed in nature and its physiological importance goes
   beyond its role as an inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous
   system in mammals. Since microbial fermentation is one of the most
   promising methods to obtain GABA, the production of this metabolite by
   several strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from quinoa and
   amaranth sourdoughs was investigated. Lactobacillus brevis CRL 2013
   produced the highest GABA levels, reaching 265 mM when optimal culture
   conditions were set up. The fermentative profile showed that CRL 2013
   was able to catabolize carbohydrates through the phosphoketolase pathway
   yielding variable amounts of lactic acid, acetate and ethanol, which
   depended on the type of carbon source available and the presence of
   external electron acceptors such as fructose. Enhanced growth parameters
   and low GABA synthesis were associated to pentose fermentation. This
   impairment on GABA production machinery was partially overpassed by the
   addition of ethanol to the culture media. These results support the
   potential use of L. brevis CRL 2013 as a starter culture for the
   manufacture of GABA-enriched functional foods and provide further
   insights to the understanding of the GAD system regulation in lactic
   acid bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Background Until recently, synthetic fiber conjunctival granuloma (SFCG)
   is rarely reported and has been poorly understood. Our study was to
   explore the clinical features, histopathologic characteristics, surgical
   outcomes, and prognosis of SFCG after surgical excision. Methods
   Retrospective review of clinical findings, histopathological and
   immunohistochemical studies identified 18 cases of SFCG. Specimens were
   routinely processed and stained with H\&E. Immunohistochemical stains
   for GMS, PAS, CD68 and CK-pan were also performed. Results Eighteen
   patients with an average age of 9.3 +/- 6.6 years had a tender white to
   red mass on the conjunctiva. All the lesions were completely removed,
   and none of the patients relapsed. Histologically, all of the specimens
   revealed inflammatory granulation tissues with a large number of
   inflammatory cells infiltration and the presence of synthetic fibers.
   Immunohistochemical stains were positive for CD68, CK, GMS and PAS.
   Conclusions Synthetic fiber conjunctival granuloma is an uncommon lesion
   with foreign body sensation caused by inoculation of synthetic exogenous
   materials. These lesions are mostly unilateral and occur in the inferior
   conjunctival fornix. SFCGs are characterized by a large number of
   inflammatory cells infiltration and the presence of synthetic fibers.
   Surgical excision followed by topical corticosteroids has been
   clinically proven to be effective.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Malaria remains a major healthcare risk to growing economies like India,
   and a chromosome-level reference genome of Anopheles stephensi is
   critical for successful vector management and understanding of vector
   evolution using comparative genomics. We report chromosome-level
   assemblies of an Indian strain, STE2, and a Pakistani strain SDA-500 by
   combining draft genomes of the two strains using a homology-based
   iterative approach. The resulting assembly IndV3/PakV3 with L50 of 9/12
   and N50 6.3/6.9 Mb had scaffolds long enough for building 90\% of the
   euchromatic regions of the three chromosomes, IndV3s/PakV3s, using
   low-resolution physical markers and enabled the generation of the next
   version of genome assemblies, IndV4/PakV4, using HiC data. We have
   validated these assemblies using contact maps against publicly available
   HiC raw data from two strains including STE2 and another lab strain of
   An. stephensi from UCI and compare the quality of the assemblies with
   other assemblies made available as preprints since the submission of the
   manuscript. We show that the IndV3s and IndV4 assemblies are sensitive
   in identifying a homozygous 2Rb inversion in the UCI strain and a 2Rb
   polymorphism in the STE2 strain. Multiple tandem copies of CYP6a14, 4c1,
   and 4c21 genes, implicated in insecticide resistance, lie within this
   inversion locus. Comparison of assembled genomes suggests a variation of
   1 in 81 positions between the UCI and STE2 lab strains, 1 in 82 between
   SDA-500 and UCI strain, and 1 in 113 between SDA-500 and STE2 strains of
   An. stephensi, which are closer than 1 in 68 variations among
   individuals from two other lab strains sequenced and reported here.
   Based on the developmental transcriptome and orthology of all the 54
   olfactory receptors (ORs) to those of other Anopheles species, we
   identify an OR with the potential for host recognition in the genus
   Anopheles. A comparative analysis of An. stephensi genomes with the
   completed genomes of a few other Anopheles species suggests limited
   inter-chromosomal gene flow and loss of synteny within chromosomal arms
   even among the closely related species.}},

Title = {{Future medical student practice intentions: the South Africa experience}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Background Primary care is a broad spectrum specialty that can serve
   both urban and rural populations. It is important to examine the
   specialties students are selecting to enter, future community size they
   intend to practice in as well as whether they intend to remain in the
   communities in which they trained. Aim The goals of this study were to
   characterize the background and career aspirations of medical students.
   Objectives were to (1) explore whether there are points in time during
   training that may affect career goals and (2) assess how students'
   background and stated motivations for choosing medicine as a career
   related to intended professional practice. Setting The setting for this
   study was the Nelson R. Mandela School of Medicine, located in Durban,
   South Africa. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 597 NRMSM
   medical students in their first, fourth, or sixth-year studies during
   the 2017 academic year. Results Our findings show a noticeable lack of
   interest in primary care, and in particular, family medicine amongst
   graduating students. Altruism is not as motivating a factor for
   practicing medicine as it was among students beginning their education.
   Conclusion Selection of students into medical school should consider
   personal characteristics such as background and career motivation. Once
   students are selected, local context matters for training to sustain
   motivation. Selection of students most likely to practice primary care,
   then emphasizing family medicine and community immersion with
   underserved populations, can assist in building health workforce
   capacity. There are institutional, legislative, and market pressures
   influencing career choice either toward or away from primary care. In
   this paper, we will discuss only the institutional aspects.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL \& CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{39}},

Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Background Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most frequent endocrine
   tumor. Radioiodine (RAI) treatment is highly effective in these tumors,
   but up to 60\% of metastatic cases become RAI-refractory. Scanty data
   are available on either the molecular pattern of radioiodine refractory
   papillary thyroid cancers (PTC) or the mechanisms responsible for RAI
   resistance. Methods We analyzed the molecular profile and gene/miRNA
   expression in primary PTCs, synchronous and RAI-refractory lymph node
   metastases (LNMs) in correlation to RAI avidity or refractoriness. We
   classified patients as RAI+/D+ (RAI uptake/disease persistence), RAI-/D+
   (absent RAI uptake/disease persistence), and RAI+/D- (RAI uptake/disease
   remission), and analyzed the molecular and gene/miRNA profiles, and the
   expression of thyroid differentiation (TD) related genes. Results A
   different molecular profile according to the RAI class was observed:
   BRAF(V600E) cases were more frequent in RAI-/D+ (P = 0.032), and fusion
   genes in RAI+/D+ cases. RAI+/D- patients were less frequently pTERT
   mutations positive, and more frequently wild type for the tested
   mutations/fusions. Expression profiles clearly distinguished PTC from
   normal thyroid. On the other hand, in refractory cases (RAI+/D+ and
   RAI-/D+) no distinctive PTC expression patterns were associated with
   either tissue type, or RAI uptake, but with the driving lesion and
   BRAF-/RAS-like subtype. Primary tumors and RAI-refractory LNMs with
   BRAF(V600E) mutation display transcriptome similarity suggesting that
   RAI minimally affects the expression profiles of RAI-refractory
   metastases. Molecular profiles associated with the expression of TPO,
   SLC26A4 and TD genes, that were found more downregulated in BRAF(V600E)
   than in gene fusions tumors. Conclusions The present data indicate a
   different molecular profile in RAI-avid and RAI-refractory metastatic
   PTCs. Moreover, BRAF(V600E) tumors displayed reduced differentiation and
   intrinsic RAI refractoriness, while PTCs with fusion oncogenes are
   RAI-avid but persistent, suggesting different oncogene-driven mechanisms
   leading to RAI refractoriness.}},

Abstract = {{Around 350 million tonnes of plastics are annually produced worldwide. A
   remarkable percentage of these products is dispersed in the environment,
   finally reaching and dispersed in the marine environment. Recent field
   surveys detected microplastics' concentrations in the Mediterranean Sea.
   The most commonly polymers found were polyethylene, polypropylene and
   viscose, ethylene vinyl acetate and polystyrene. In general, the in-situ
   monitoring of microplastic pollution is difficult and time consuming.
   The main goals of this work were to spectrally characterize the most
   commonly polymers and to quantify their spectral separability that may
   allow to determine optimal band combinations for imaging techniques
   monitoring. The spectral signatures of microplastics have been analysed
   in laboratory, both in dry condition and on water surface, using a full
   spectrum spectroradiometer. The theoretical use of operational satellite
   images for remote sensing monitoring was investigated by quantifying the
   spectral separability achievable by their sensors. The WorldView-3
   sensor appears the most suitable for the monitoring but better average
   spectral separability are expected using the recently released PRISMA
   images. This research was preparatory to further outdoor experiments
   needed to better simulate the real acquisition condition.}},

Title = {{Emotional configurations of politicization in social justice movements}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND LEARNING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{9-10, SI}},
Pages = {{729-747}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to trace how emotion shapes the sense that is
   made of politics and how politicization can remake and re-mark emotion,
   giving it new meaning in context. This paper brings together theories of
   politicization and emotional configurations in learning to interrogate
   the role emotion plays in the learning of social justice activists.
   Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on sociocultural learning
   perspectives, the paper traces politicization processes across the youth
   climate movement (using video-based interaction analysis) and the animal
   rights movement (using ethnographic interviews and participant
   observation).
   Findings - Emotional configurations significantly impacted activists'
   politicization in terms of what was learned conceptually, the kinds of
   practices - including emotional practices - that were taken up
   collectively, the epistemologies that framed social justice work, and
   the identities that were made salient in collective action. In turn,
   politicization reshaped how social justice activists made sense of
   emotion in the course of activist practice.
   Social implications - This study is valuable for theorizing social
   justice learning, so social movement facilitators and educators might
   design spaces where learning about gender, racialization, colonialism
   and/or human/more-than-human relations can thrive. By attending to
   emotional configurations, this study can help facilitate a design that
   supports and sustains learning for justice.
   Originality/value - Emotion remains under-theorized and under-analyzed
   in the learning sciences, despite indications that emotion enables and
   constrains particular learning opportunities. This paper proposes new
   ways of understanding emotion and politicization as co-constitutive
   processes for learning scientists interested in politics and social
   justice.}},

   Wrong Choice?}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN SURGERY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Persistent sciatic artery (PSA) is a rare congenital
   malformation that could lead to serious complications such as lower
   extremity ischemiais. We report the treatment of a PSA patient combined
   with limb ischemia.
   Methods: A 64-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for intermittent
   claudication of the right lower limb. The right ankle-brachial index
   (ABI) was 0.5. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed the
   presence of an incomplete PSA with an absence superficial femoral
   artery. We performed catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) and stenting
   placement for the patient.
   Results: The vessels were successfully opened, and the claudication was
   resolved. However, half a year after the operation, the right PSA of the
   patient was occluded.
   Conclusion: The etiology, pathophysiology, and anatomic factors should
   be considered in the treatment of PSA. Endovascular treatment, bypass
   surgery, and drug therapy should be balanced. Improper choice of any
   treatment regimen may result in poor prognosis.}},

Abstract = {{Four different {[} PSiP]-pincer ligands L1-L4 ((2-Ph2PC6H4)(2)SiHR (R =
   H (L1) and Ph (L2)) and (2-(Pr2PC6H4)-Pr-i)(2)SiHR' (R' = Ph (L3) and H
   (L4)) were used to investigate the effect of substituents at P and/or Si
   atom of the {[}PSiP] pincer ligands on the formation of silyl cobalt(I)
   complexes by the reactions with CoMe(PMe3)(4) via Si-H cleavage. Two
   pentacoordinated silyl cobalt(I) complexes, (2-Ph2PC6H4)2HSiCo(PMe3)(2)
   (1) and (2-Ph2PC6H4)(2)PhSiCo(PMe3) 2 (2), were obtained from the
   reactions of L1 and L2 with CoMe(PMe3)(4), respectively. Under similar
   reaction conditions, a tetracoordinated cobalt(I) complex
   (2-(i)Pr2(P)C(6)H(4))(2)PhSiCo(PMe3) (3) was isolated from the
   interaction of L3 with CoMe(PMe3)(4). It was found that, only in the
   case of ligand L4, silyl dinitrogen cobalt(I) complex 4,
   {[}(2-(Pr2PC6H4)-Pr-i)(2)HSiCo(N-2)(PMe3)], was formed. Our results
   indicate that the increasing of electron cloud density at the Co center
   is beneficial for the formation of a dinitrogen cobalt complex because
   the large electron density at Co center leads to the enhancement of the
   p-backbonding from cobalt to the coordinated N-2. It was found that
   silyl dinitrogen cobalt(I) complex 4 is an effective catalyst for
   catalytic transformation of dinitrogen into silylamine. Among these four
   silyl cobalt(I) complexes, complex 1 is the best catalyst for
   hydrosilylation of alkenes with excellent regioselectivity. For aromatic
   alkenes, catalyst 1 provided Markovnikov products, while for aliphatic
   alkenes, antiMarkovnikov products could be obtained. Both catalytic
   reaction mechanisms were proposed and discussed. The molecular
   structures of complexes 1-4 were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray
   diffraction.}},

Abstract = {{In magnetometry using optically detected magnetic resonance of nitrogen
   vacancy (N-V-) centers, we demonstrate speedup of more than 1 order of
   magnitude with a sequential Bayesian experiment design as compared with
   conventional frequency-swept measurements. The N-V- center is an
   excellent platform for magnetometry, with potential spatial resolution
   down to a few nanometers and demonstrated single-defect sensitivity down
   to nanoteslas per square root hertz. The N-V- center is a quantum defect
   with spin S =1 and coherence time up to several milliseconds at room
   temperature. Zeeman splitting of the N-V- energy levels allows detection
   of the magnetic field via photoluminescence. We compare conventional
   N-V- center photoluminescence measurements that use predetermined sweeps
   of the microwave frequency with measurements using a Bayesian-inference
   method. In sequential Bayesian experiment design, the settings with
   maximum utility are chosen for each measurement in real time on the
   basis of the accumulated experimental data. Using this method, we
   observe an order of magnitude decrease in the N-V--centermagnetometry
   measurement time necessary to achieve a set precision.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally assumed that increased satisfaction levels lead to
   improved financial performance. However, this assumed relationship is,
   by and large, still to be proven in a more general setting, especially
   with respect to European sectors and industries. This research aims to
   identify empirically relationships between customer loyalty and
   satisfaction and profitability measured as ROA, ROE, profit margin and
   operating income, as well as market indicators (market capitalisation
   and Tobin's q). The research sample is made up of nine Scandinavian
   banks observed on an annual basis between 2004 and 2014. We can confirm
   that customer satisfaction and loyalty have a significant positive
   influence on banks' profitability and can be considered as a predictor
   for future profitability as the satisfaction index of the preceding year
   influences the next year's financial performance. We are also able to
   confirm that there is a positive link between the customer satisfaction
   of the preceding year and market indicators of the current year. These
   results are important for both decision makers in banks and investors.
   They mean that decision makers and investors can take the bank's level

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{434-454}},
Month = {{AUG 11}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   This study aims to investigate the impact of the accounting and auditing
   organisation for Islamic financial institution (AAOIFI) governance
   disclosure on the performance of Islamic banks (IBs).
   Design/methodology/approach
   The ordinary least squares regression model was used to test the impact
   of AAOIFI governance disclosure on the performance of 126 IBs from 8
   countries that mandatorily adopt the AAOIFI standards for three years
   (2013-2015). In this regression model, return on asset (ROA) and return
   on equity (ROE) are the dependent variables, while AAOIFI governance
   disclosure is the independent variable. Corporate governance mechanisms,
   firm characteristics, year dummy and country dummy are used as control
   variables.
   Findings
   This paper found an insignificant relationship between AAOIFI governance
   disclosure and IBs performance.
   Research limitations/implications
   This study highlighted the implication that the current research may
   help IBs and encourage them to disclose more information in annual
   reports, especially those related to AAOIFI governance standards because
   following good corporate governance leads to good financial performance.
   The major limitation of the paper is that it is only focussed on two
   measurements of bank performance - ROA and ROE; it would be good to use
   other firm performance measures, such as profit margin.
   Originality/value
   This study provides new empirical evidence on the impact of AAOIFI
   governance disclosure on IBs performance.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Hyperinsulinism (HI), the most common neonatal cause of
   persistent hypoglycemia, can be associated with prolonged
   hospitalizations and risk for long-term neurological sequelae. Rapid
   identification of transient versus persistent forms of HI is crucial to
   optimize management. Objectives: The aims of the study were to assess
   the ability of clinical and biochemical features at presentation to
   predict transient versus persistent HI, and to evaluate differences in
   hospital outcomes. Methods: This study is a retrospective review of 79
   infants with HI admitted to the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto,
   from 2012 to 2017. Patients were classified into 3 groups: transient and
   the 2 persistent forms, diazoxide responsive and diazoxide unresponsive
   (DU). Results: Infants with birth weight >90th percentile had an 8-fold
   increased risk of having a persistent form of HI (OR 8.8, 95\% CI
   2.5-30) and a 21-fold increased risk of having a DU form of HI (OR 21.1,
   95\% CI 4.9-91.8). The majority of children with transient HI and a
   birth weight >90th percentile were born to mothers with gestational
   diabetes. There were no other useful clinical or biochemical presenting
   features that differentiated the groups. There were significant
   differences in outcome measures, with the DU children more likely to
   require gastrostomy tube insertion and have an extended length of
   hospital admission. Conclusion: A higher birth weight in the absence of
   maternal gestational diabetes is highly associated with a persistent
   form of HI. Given the marked difference in clinical outcomes between
   groups, expedited genetic testing should be considered in infants with
   this presentation to inform clinical management.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{57}},

Pages = {{574-580}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Aim Rapid blood culture pathogen identification facilitated by
   matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight and GeneXpert
   has the potential to improve antibiotic prescribing. This study
   investigates the impact of these rapid diagnostics on the timeliness of
   effective and optimal antibiotic prescribing in paediatric patients with
   bacteraemia.
   Methods A single centre retrospective cohort study was performed
   comparing paediatric bacteraemia cases pre- and post-rapid diagnostic
   implementation. Primary outcomes were the proportion of cases receiving,
   and median time to administration of effective and optimal antibiotics
   from blood culture collection. Secondary outcomes included hospital
   length of stay, intensive care unit admissions, and all-cause mortality.
   Results A total of 255 bacteraemia cases were subject to final data
   analysis, 129 in the control cohort (pre-implementation of rapid
   diagnostics) and 126 in the rapid diagnostics cohort. The median time to
   effective (2.3 vs. 1.8 h, P = 0.20) and optimal therapy (44.4 vs. 39.1
   h, P = 0.66) did not differ significantly between the cohorts. There was
   also no significant difference found in the number of cases reaching
   effective (120 vs. 116, P = 0.77) and optimal therapy (66 vs. 62, P =
   0.76), length of stay (7 vs. 9 days), all-cause mortality (1.6 vs.
   1.6\%) and number of intensive care unit admissions (20 vs. 15).
   Conclusion The implementation of rapid diagnostics, when used in
   isolation, resulted in no improvement in antibiotic prescribing or
   patient clinical outcomes. To be effective, rapid diagnostics must be
   coupled with active real-time antimicrobial stewardship promotion,
   de-escalation or modification based on early laboratory results.}},

Title = {{Lessons from the short- and mid-term outcome of medical rehabilitation
   in adults with congenital heart disease}},
Journal = {{CARDIOVASCULAR DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY}},
Abstract = {{Background: The number of adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) is
   steadily increasing. Over their life-time, many of the affected patients
   require medical rehabilitation after interventional or surgical
   treatment of residua, sequels or complications of their congenital heart
   defect (CHD). However, up to now only scarce data exist about
   indication, performance and outcomes of cardiac rehabilitation in ACHD.
   Methods: The course and outcome of rehabilitation after previous
   interventional or surgical treatment in ACHD was analyzed in a
   retrospective cohort study. Results: Two hundred and five ACHD \{54\%
   female; mean age 34 +/- 12 {[}16-68] years\} with mild (23.9\%),
   moderate (35.1\%) or severe CHD (41.0\%), of whom 32\% had complex CHD,
   21\% right-ventricular outflow tract obstructions, 20\% pre-tricuspid
   shunts, 18\% left heart or aortic anomalies, 9\% post-tricuspid shunts
   and 2\% other congenital cardiac anomalies were included into analysis.
   The main indications for rehabilitation were a preceding surgical (92\%)
   or interventional (3\%) treatment of the underlying CHD immediately
   before rehabilitation. During rehabilitation, no severe complications
   occurred. The number of patients in function class I/II increased from
   189 to 200 and decreased in class III/IV from 16 to 5. Cardiac
   medication could be reduced or stopped after rehabilitation in 194
   patients, with the exception of ACE inhibitors. There was an improvement
   in cardiovascular risk factors. While before medical treatment 77\%
   (n=157) patients were capable of working, the number increased to 82\%
   {[}168] at the end of rehabilitation. Throughout a follow-up 9.3\%
   (n=19) of patients needed further cardiac interventions. Conclusions:
   The current study provided for the first time comprehensive data on the
   course of rehabilitation in a large cohort of ACHD after surgical or
   interventional treatment. The overall outcome of ACHD after
   rehabilitation was uneventful and favorable. Further research is
   required to assess the clinical long-term outcome, the impact of
   rehabilitation on the quality of life, disease coping and employment.
   The results of this study can serve as a benchmark for the development
   of specific rehabilitation programs in ACHD.}},

Abstract = {{In this experimental study, a commercially available AA 6063 in the form
   of cold profile extruded and T6 heat treated was processed by
   Incremental Equal Angular Pressing (I-ECAP) through the B-C route.
   I-ECAP deformation was applied at room temperature with a feeding rate
   of 0.1 mm/cycle. Afterward, the effect of I-ECAP on the microstructure
   and mechanical properties of AA 6063 was investigated in detail. The aim
   of this study was to investigate the possibilities to improve properties
   of semi-products of commercially available aluminum alloy, especially
   for industrial applications. According to the visible light microscope
   observations 4 passes of I-ECAP resulted in grain size reduction, which
   was 46\%. The hardness and tensile test results showed that the I-ECAP
   process significantly increased mechanical properties of the billets.
   The hardness was 56\% higher, and the mechanical strength was 37\%
   higher than measured for the initial state. Moreover, the grain size
   distribution was more homogenous in the 4 I-ECAP passes processed
   samples than the initial state. According to these results, the I-ECAP
   method has potential in industrial usage for manufacturing ultrafine and
   fine-grain semi- and final products with superior mechanical properties.

Abstract = {{Bioactive molecules play a vital role in the process of regulating the
   redox balance in the intracellular environment, especially in
   maintaining the function of organelles. To explore the association and
   function of bioactive molecules in organelles, it is essential to
   develop a chemosensor tool that uses multiresponse fluorescence signals
   to distinguish between and track two related bioactive molecules in
   organelles. However, the development of sensors with multiresponse
   functions is still a challenging task. Herein, we present a unique and
   practical single chemosensor (Mito-CTC) that can monitor HClO (as an
   oxidative substance) and H2S (as a reductive substance) in mitochondria
   (organelle targeting) with multiresponse fluorescence signals. The
   response of the sensor to HClO and H2S changes from red to green and
   blue channel emission simultaneously, respectively, thereby providing a
   specific signal response to reductive/oxidative substances in the
   mitochondria. Using a single chemosensor, we have realized multichannel
   bioimaging of the exogenous and endogenous HClO and H2S in cellular
   mitochondria. Additionally, the excellent properties of the sensor
   Mito-CTC can be used to reveal the relationship between HClO and H2S in
   mitochondria. Meanwhile, Mito-CTC has been endowed with the ability to
   image in bacteria and zebrafish attributed to the good permeability and
   low cytotoxicity. Expectantly, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) caused
   by fluoxetine (an antidepressant drug) and the degree of druginduced
   toxicity to the liver were evaluated using Mito-CTC through
   discriminating and imaging HClO, indicating that Mito-CTC has the
   potential function of evaluating the toxicity of the drug to the liver.}},

Abstract = {{Despite ongoing efforts and technology development, the contamination of
   medical device surfaces by disease-causing microbes remains problematic.
   Two approaches to producing antimicrobial surfaces are using
   antimicrobial materials and applying physical topography such as
   nanopatterns. In this work, we describe the use of physical topography
   on a soft hydrogel to control microbial growth. We demonstrate this
   approach by using chitosan hydrogel films with nanopillars having
   periodicities ranging from 300 to 500 nm. The flat hydrophilic chitosan
   films exhibit antimicrobial activity against the pathogenic bacteria
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa and filamentous fungi Fusarium oxysporum. The
   addition of nanopillars to the hydrogel surface further reduces the
   growth of P. aeruginosa and F. oxysporum up to similar to 52 and similar
   to 99\%, respectively. Multiple modes of antimicrobial action appear to
   act synergistically to inhibit microbial growth on the nanopillar
   hydrogels. We verified that the strongly bactericidal and fungicidal
   nanopillared material retains biocompatibility to human epithelial cells
   with the MTT assay. The nanopillared material is a promising candidate
   for applications that require a biocompatible and antimicrobial film.
   The study demonstrates that taking advantage of multiple modes of
   antimicrobial action can effectively inhibit pathogenic microbial
   growth.}},

Abstract = {{tert-Butyl esters are demonstrated to function as chain transfer agents
   (CTAs) in the cationic copolymerization of vinyl ether (VE) and oxirane
   via concurrent vinyl-addition and ring-opening mechanisms. In the
   copolymerization of isopropyl VE and isobutylene oxide (IBO), the
   IBO-derived propagating species reacts with tert-butyl acetate to
   generate a copolymer chain with an acetoxy group at the omega-end. This
   reaction liberates a tert-butyl cation; hence, a polymer chain with a
   tert-butyl group at the alpha-end is subsequently generated. Other
   tert-butyl esters also function as CTAs, and the substituent attached to
   the carbonyl group affects the chain transfer efficiency. In addition,
   ethyl acetate does not function as a CTA, which suggests the importance
   of the liberation of a tert-butyl cation for the chain transfer process.
   Chain transfer reactions by tert-butyl esters potentially occur
   reversibly through the reaction of the propagating cation with the ester
   group at the omega-end of another chain.}},

Abstract = {{Background There is a huge burden of diabetes-related complications,
   both microvascular and macrovascular, in India. With the rising
   prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM), this translates to an increasing
   number of people with complications of DM. Diabetic peripheral
   neuropathy (DPN) is the most common complication among DM patients with
   a prevalence ranging from 18.8 to 61.9\% in India. Early diagnosis of
   DPN can reduce associated complications. Screening services at the
   primary healthcare level can aid early diagnosis of complications and
   improve health outcomes among DM patients. This study aimed to assess
   the prevalence of DPN and its risk factors among the type 2 DM patients
   attending a rural health centre. Methodology A cross-sectional study was
   conducted among 390 type 2 DM patients attending the Rural Health and
   Training Centre of Sri Ramachandra Medical College \& Research
   Institute. Data was collected using a standardized questionnaire
   followed by general inspection and physical examination of the feet.
   Blood sample was taken to estimate HbA1c and urine sample was collected
   to detect presence of albumin. Results Among the 390 participants, 175
   (44.9\%) had neuropathy of which 87 (51.5\%) were symptomatic.
   Educational status of primary schooling and less (OR = 3.34; p < 0.001),
   duration of DM (OR = 1.73; p = 0.038), higher HbA1c levels (OR = 2.87; p
   = 0.018), presence of urine albumin (OR = 2.57; p = 0.033) and
   peripheral vascular disease (OR = 2.85; p < 0.001) were predictors for
   DPN. Conclusion The present study shows that the prevalence of
   peripheral neuropathy is high in rural areas. Regular screening using
   simple clinical bedside methods and affordable tools can help early
   identification of DPN and prevent complications like foot ulcer which
   ultimately leads to amputation.}},

Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{A ventilation network feature graph can directly and quantitatively
   represent the features of a ventilation network. To ensure the stability
   of airflow in a mine and improve ventilation system analysis, we propose
   a new algorithm to draw ventilation network feature graphs. The
   independent path method serves as the algorithm's main frame, and an
   improved adaptive genetic algorithm is embedded so that the graph may be
   drawn better. A mathematical model based on the node adjacency matrix
   method for unidirectional circuit discrimination is constructed as the
   drawing algorithm may not be valid in such cases. By modifying the
   edge-seeking strategy, the improved depth-first search algorithm can be
   used to determine all of the paths in the ventilation network with
   unidirectional circuits, and the equivalent transformation method of
   network topology relations is used to draw the ventilation network
   feature graph. Through the analysis of the topological relation of a
   ventilation network, a simplified mathematical model is constructed, and
   network simplification technology makes the drawing concise and
   hierarchical. The rapid and intuitive drawing of the ventilation network
   feature graphs is significant for optimization of the ventilation system
   and day-to-day management.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we performed an anatomical analysis of the
   polysporangiate anthers and the development of pollen in Isertia laevis
   (Rubiaceae) with the aim to elucidate the internal structure of these
   atypical anthers. For this purpose, flowers in successive stages of
   development were dissected and the anthers were processed for
   conventional anatomical analysis. The material was examined using light
   microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The present study shows
   that the anthers of Isertia laevis have two thecae divided into multiple
   microsporangia. This division is due to the presence of transverse and
   longitudinal septa formed of parenchyma and idioblasts with crystals.
   The septa appear together with the microsporangia and remain in the
   mature anther, even developing fibrous thickening. As the anther
   matures, the idioblasts in the septa accumulate crystals until they
   break, facilitating the separation of the septa from the outer wall of
   the theca, and thus apparently assisting the process of dehiscence. The
   mature anther opens through the longitudinal dehiscence of each theca.
   In addition to the anatomy of the anther, the development and morphology
   of the pollen, and the presence of orbicules are described. The
   structure of the anthers of I. laevis is discussed with other
   polysporangiate species in the Rubiaceae and angiosperms.}},

Abstract = {{Catalyst development for the efficient direction of electrocatalytic
   water splitting with much less overpotential is crucial for meeting
   large-scale hydrogen generation. Being highly abundant and
   cost-effective, 3d transition-metal-based catalysts show promising
   activities in alkaline conditions. In this work, bimetallic
   nickel-cobalt carbonate hydroxide hydrate (NiCo-CHH) was prepared by a
   co-precipitation method with varying molar ratios of Ni/Co of 0.5:1,
   1:1, and 1.5:1, which were analyzed for oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
   study in both alkaline (1 M KOH) and near-neutral (1 M NaHCO3) media.
   For OER in 1 M KOH, NiCoCHH 1:1 required overpotential of just 238 mV at
   10 mA cm(-2) current density compared to other ratios of 0.5:1 and
   1.5:1, which required 290 and 308 mV, respectively. Similarly, in 1 M
   NaHCO3, NiCoCHH 1:1 required an overpotential of 623 mV to reach 10 mA
   cm(-2). A post-OER study confirmed the formation of NiOOH during OER The
   observed faradaic efficiency was nearly 95.21\% for the NiCoCHH 1:1
   catalyst. A two-electrode setup with NiCoCHH 1:1 parallel to Pt required
   just 312 mV as an overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2). These kinds of
   comparative studies can be used in other 3d transition-metal-based
   catalysts for OER in the future.}},

Title = {{The role of specific heritage among Hispanic-owned banks in America}},
Journal = {{MANAGERIAL FINANCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{47}},

Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Specific types of Hispanic-owned banks (HOBs), including those
   related to Brazilian, Cuban, Mexican or Puerto Rican heritage, have not
   be analyzed to date. There are important differences between the
   relevant communities, including geographic location, language barriers,
   population size and the importance of remittances to foreign nations.
   The analysis here sheds light on these differences.
   Design/methodology/approach HOBs with the Federal Deposit Insurance
   Corporation (FDIC)-designated minority-owned depository institution
   (MDI) designation are identified, along with bank ownership heritage.
   Financial data, a measure of market competition, and demographics of
   depositors from 2003 to 2017 are utilized in an exploratory analysis
   comparing banks by HOB type, with random effects regressions for the
   pre-collapse (2003-2006) and post-collapse (2009-2017) periods. Findings
   Although each of the four types of HOBs serve Hispanic and poor
   communities, there are substantial differences. For example, Brazilian
   and Puerto Rican banks on the island held high levels of nonperforming
   loans (NPLs) post-collapse, with the Brazilian and Mexican banks
   expanding levels of risky commercial real estate (CRE) lending
   post-collapse, while the Cuban banks contracted CRE lending. Differences
   in terms of return on assets (ROAs), the cost of borrowed funds and the
   tier-1 risk-based capital ratio are also identified. Social implications
   HOBs, like Latinos in the USA, are culturally heterogeneous and likely
   operate in different ways depending upon the culture and economic
   circumstances of the communities where they operate. Originality/value
   Although there is substantial research on MDIs, this is the first
   analysis which treats HOBs as culturally heterogeneous. Further research
   of this type is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{In standard queues, when there are waiting customers, service
   completions are followed by service commencements. In retrial queues,
   this is not the case. In such systems, customers try to receive service
   at a time of their choosing, or the server seeks the next customer for a
   non-negligible time. In this note, we consider a hybrid model with both
   a finite standard queue and an orbit. While in the orbit, customers try
   to join the standard queue in their own time. We assume that the retrial
   rate is a decision variable, and study both the Nash equilibrium and the
   socially optimal retrial rates, under a cost model that considers both
   waiting costs and retrial costs.}},

Title = {{Automated classification of a tropical landscape infested by Parthenium
   weed (Parthenium hyterophorus)}},

Abstract = {{The invasive Parthenium weed (Parthenium hyterophorus) adversely affects
   animal and human health, agricultural productivity, rural livelihoods,
   local and national economies, and the environment. Its fast spreading
   capability requires consistent monitoring for adoption of relevant
   mitigation approaches, potentially through remote sensing. To date,
   studies that have endeavoured to map the Parthenium weed have commonly
   used popular classification algorithms that include support vector
   machines and random forest classifiers, which do not capture the complex
   structural characteristics of the weed. Furthermore, determination of
   site or data specific algorithms, often achieved through intensive
   comparison of algorithms, is often laborious and time consuming. In
   addition, selected algorithms may not be optimal on datasets collected
   in other sites. Hence, this study adopted the Tree-based Pipeline
   Optimization Tool (TPOT), an automated machine learning approach that
   can be used to overcome high data variability during the classification
   process. Using Sentinel-2 and Land Satellite (Landsat) 8 imagery to map
   Parthenium weed, we compared the outcome of the TPOT to the best
   performing and optimized algorithm selected from sixteen classifiers on
   different training datasets. Results showed that the TPOT model yielded
   a higher overall classification accuracy (88.15\%) using Sentinel-2 and
   74\% using Landsat 8, accuracies that were higher than the commonly used
   robust classifiers. This study is the first to demonstrate the value of
   TPOT in mapping Parthenium weed infestations using satellite imagery.
   Its adoption would therefore be useful in limiting human intervention
   while optimizing classification accuracies for mapping invasive plants.
   Based on these findings, we propose TPOT as an efficient method for
   selecting and tuning algorithms for Parthenium discrimination and
   monitoring, and indeed general vegetation mapping.}},

Abstract = {{A mixture of two Weibull distributions (WW) has a variety of usage area
   from reliability analysis to wind speed modeling. Maximum likelihood
   (ML) method is the most frequently used method in parameter estimation
   of WW. Due to the nonlinear nature of the log-likelihood function of WW,
   usage of iterative techniques is a necessary process. Conventional
   iterative techniques such as Newton Raphson (NR) require considerable
   analytical preparatory to work to obtain gradient and may lead to
   numerical difficulties such as convergence problems. The aim of this
   paper is to present a genetic algorithm (GA) with an adaptive search
   space based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain the
   ML estimators of the parameters of WW. The simulation study is conducted
   to compare the performances of ML estimators obtained using NR
   algorithm, EM algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm, and the proposed
   GA. Furthermore, real data examples are used to compare the efficiency
   of proposed GA with the existing methods in the literature. Simulation
   results and real data examples show that the proposed GA has superiority
   over other techniques in terms of efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{As the amount of decentralised generation is continuously increasing,
   the control and maintenance of grid stability become more complex. This
   is mainly caused by a change of production capacities from the
   high-voltage area to the distribution network. As most renewable energy
   sources in the distribution network are nowadays connected to power
   electronic converters, harmonic distortion as well as asymmetries
   (electric vehicle chargers, household photovoltaic systems) are
   increased. To ensure stability, reliability, and efficiency of the
   energy distribution network, a grid regulator including asymmetrical and
   harmonic control is introduced. This grid regulator consists of two
   inverter systems, where one is connected by a series booster transformer
   in line, while the other is connected in parallel to the line, capable
   of decoupling network segments from each other. After a successful
   verification in simulation, the control structure is implemented in a
   real hardware setup. The results show that the introduced system is able
   to decouple network elements in case of an unbalanced situation as well
   as harmonic current and voltage distortion. To simplify inverter
   hardware a silicon carbide hardware topology is introduced with a
   reduced number of switches. Lower switching losses result in higher
   overall system efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives:The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the
   survival rates of periviable births in a referral Level III NICU center
   in Turkey; the secondary aim was to determine the perinatal and natal
   risk factors related to mortality. Methods:This retrospective
   cross-sectional study was conducted at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
   between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2015. All live deliveries
   occurring from 22 0/7 weeks to 25 6/7 week of gestation were included in
   the study (totaln = 165). We documented prenatal, natal, and postnatal
   clinical processes in each case and assessed morbidity, mortality, and
   factors related to long-term prognosis. Results:While none of the
   infants born at 22 weeks of gestation survived until discharge, the
   survival rates for those admitted to the NICU were 7.5\% for infants
   born at 23 weeks, 29.1\% at 24 weeks, and 43.5\% at 25 weeks. A total of
   46 survived (27.9\%), and follow-up data beyond 12 months were available
   for 22. The prevalence of neurodevelopmental impairment or neurosensory
   impairment was inversely associated with gestational age.
   Conclusions:The most important risk factors associated with mortality in
   periviable infants were SNAPPE score, antenatal corticosteroid use, and
   gestational age.}},

Abstract = {{Background In December 2019, a new disease (COVID-19) caused by a novel
   coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China and spread to many other
   countries. There is only limited data about the clinical features of
   COVID-19 during pregnancy, especially in first trimester. Case
   presentation We report a COVID-19 infection in a 35 years-old patient in
   first trimester of pregnancy and its consequent medical care. At 7 weeks
   of pregnancy, the patient, who did not have any pregestational
   comorbidities, complained of intense nausea and asthenia. An important
   liver cytolysis was discovered with biological perturbations of
   transaminases levels. No respiratory symptoms were recorded. Classical
   viral aetiologies and drug-related toxicity were discarded. Because of
   the aggravation of the symptoms and the occurrence of the
   breathlessness, the patient was tested for the COVID-19 in a
   nasopharyngeal swab. The RTq-PCR assay indicated the presence of
   SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In the absence of severe symptoms, the patient was
   monitored at home according to the French government guidelines. After a
   few days, the symptoms resolved without any complications. The pregnancy
   is still ongoing without any visible sequelae on the foetus so far.
   Conclusions This first case illustrated the difficulty of COVID-19
   diagnosis in patients with isolated digestive symptoms in first
   trimester of pregnancy that could be confused with gravida hyperemesis.
   Monitoring of pregnancy after an episode of COVID-19 should be
   strengthened with bimonthly foetal growth ultrasounds and doppler
   assessments because of the risks for intrauterine growth restriction.
   Comprehensive data on larger numbers of first trimester gravid women
   with COVID-19 are required to better understanding the overall impact of
   SARS-CoV-2 on maternal and birth outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to extend the theory of planned behaviour
   (TPB) by incorporating environmental concern (EC) and its dimensions to
   explain developer's intention to adopt green concepts in their future
   housing projects. The objectives were to investigate the relationship
   among the proposed constructs as well as to examine the mediating role
   of attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control (PBC) on
   the relationship between EC and its dimensions and intention to adopt
   green concepts.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A survey was conducted among developer organisations in Klang Valley and
   the key target respondents were project managers. This study devoted
   priority to quantitative approach with complementary qualitative data to
   elaborate on the statistical results. In total, 87 usable questionnaires
   were returned, representing a response rate of 24.5 per cent. In
   addition, face-to-face interviews were carried out to gather information
   to complement quantitative findings.
   Findings
   Mediation results suggested PBC to be a significant mediator for the
   relationship between EC, human over nature and eco-crisis and
   behavioural intention. In the model between eco-crisis facet and
   behavioural intention, apart from PBC, attitude was found to be another
   significant mediator of the relationship. Interview with informants
   revealed that most believed human activities are causing detrimental
   harm to the environment. With this concern, they are confident about
   their organisations' ability to deliver more green projects in the
   future.
   Originality/value
   The use of specific dimension of EC and the integration of EC and its
   dimensions within the TPB has provided new insights to expedite the
   transition to sustainable construction.}},

Title = {{Effect of Strain Rates on Failure of Mechanical Properties of Lumbar
   Intervertebral Disc Under Flexion}},
Journal = {{ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1980-1989}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate the strain-rate-dependent viscoelastic properties
   of the intervertebral disc by in vitro experiments.
   Method The biomechanical experiments were conducted from September 2019
   to December 2019. The lumbar spines of sheep were purchased within 4-6
   hours from the local slaughterhouse, and the intervertebral disc samples
   were divided into three groups. In rupture group, the samples were used
   to test the mechanical behavior of the intervertebral disc rupture at
   different strain rates. In fatigue injury group, the samples were used
   to test the mechanical behavior of fatigue injury on the intervertebral
   disc under different strain rates. In internal displacement group, the
   samples were used to test the internal displacement distribution of the
   intervertebral disc at different strain rates by applying an optimized
   digital image correlation (DIC) technique.
   Results Both the yielding and cracking phenomenon occurs at fast and
   medium loading rates, while only the yielding phenomenon occurs at a
   slow loading rate. The yield stress, compressive strength, and elastic
   modulus all increase with the increase of the strain rate, while the
   yield strain decreases with the increase of the strain rate. The
   logarithm of the elastic modulus in the intervertebral disc is
   approximately linear with the logarithm of the strain rate under
   different strain rates. Both before and after fatigue loading, the
   stiffness in the loading and unloading curves of the intervertebral disc
   is inconsistent, forming a hysteresis loop, which is caused by the
   viscoelastic effect. The strain rate has no significant effect on the
   internal displacement distribution of the intervertebral disc. Based on
   the experimental data, the constitutive relationship of the
   intervertebral disc at different strain rates is obtained. The fitting
   curves are well coupled with the experimental data, while the fitting
   parameters are approximately linear with the logarithm of the strain
   rate.
   Conclusions These experiments indicate that the strain rate has a
   significant effect on the mechanical behavior of the intervertebral disc
   rupture and fatigue injury, while the constitutive equation can predict
   the rate-dependent mechanical behavior of lumbar intervertebral disc
   under flexion very well. These results have important theoretical
   guiding significance for preventing lumbar disc herniation in daily
   life.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{Combining the catalytic activities of an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
   and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) into one electrocatalyst is of great
   significance in simultaneously prompting the charge-discharge cycles of
   various renewable energy storage and conversion systems, such as
   metal-air batteries. Herein we report a ternary metallic-based
   MgNiO2/CoNC porous hollow nanocage composite, which was assembled with
   intimate contacted MgNiO2 and Co species to form ultrathin nanocage
   shells and serve as the ORR and OER active components, respectively, to
   produce a highly bi-functional catalytic performance. The possible
   synergy of each seamlessly connected metallic site renders the hybrid
   material with excellent ORR and OER activities, which outperform the
   corresponding benchmarks. Particularly, we speculate that such efficient
   catalytic activity might arise from the synergistic chemical coupling
   effects within MgNiO2/CoNC and, therefore, these results reveal
   promising prospects in developing multi-metallic composites toward
   efficient electrochemical energy devices.}},

Abstract = {{This article studies the H-infinity fault estimation (FE) problem for
   linear discrete time-variant systems with actuator and sensor
   saturations. To handle the saturation nonlinearities for FE problem, a
   pair of an auxiliary linear model and an associated performance function
   augmenting from the conventional H-infinity performance index are
   constructed. Based on this pair, the original FE problem is readdressed
   as a two-step optimization issue with an indefinite quadratic cost
   function. For a feasible optimization solution, the partial equivalence
   between a stationary point for a quadratic optimization problem and a
   projection for vectors in indefinite inner-product space is utilized. A
   Krein-space based inner product interpretation for the indefinite cost
   function is established and optimal linear estimation technique is
   employed to derive the stationary point of the aforementioned indefinite
   quadratic cost function. The existence condition of the fault estimator
   is explicitly obtained, and the fault is reconstructed analytically via
   a forward recursion algorithm. Two examples are given to show the
   effectiveness of the proposed FE scheme.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Foreshock transients such as hot flow anomalies (HFAs) are frequently
   observed in the dayside foreshock. They can disturb the local bow shock,
   magnetopause, and consequently the magnetosphere-ionosphere system
   through dynamic pressure perturbations. Recent multipoint observations
   found that such perturbations can even propagate from the dayside to the
   midtail. However, whether the drivers of such perturbations, foreshock
   transients, persist in the midtail foreshock has not been observed.
   Thus, it is unclear whether the observed nightside
   magnetosheath/magnetopause perturbations are traveling waves or
   continuously driven by a propagating foreshock transient. Using two
   Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of the
   Moon's Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) spacecraft, we report direct
   observational evidence of foreshock transients in the midtail foreshock.
   We present a case study showing an elongated mature HFA propagating with
   its driver discontinuity from TH-C (X similar to -43 R-E) to TH-B (X
   similar to -48 R-E). Our results confirm that foreshock transients
   disturb not only the dayside bow shock but also the nightside bow shock
   while propagating tailward.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{This study presents a multi-objective optimization model for the urban
   electric transit network problem with the aim of simultaneously
   designing the layout of bus routes, the frequency and the location and
   size of charging stations by making a tradeoff between two inconsistent
   objectives from the perspectives of passengers and operators. A Pareto
   artificial fish swarm algorithm (PAFSA) embedded with the genetic
   algorithm (GA) is developed to solve the proposed model. The PAFSA is
   designed to iteratively search for the proper network configuration
   satisfying two conflicting objectives. During which, the demand
   assignment with real-time transit information is performed to update the
   frequency of each newly designed route. The GA embedded into the PAFSA
   iteratively decides the locations of charging stations and the number of
   chargers to be installed in each charging station. A case study of the
   transit network in an urban region of a city in China is implemented,
   revealing that the proposed approach is able to rationally design a
   relatively large-scaled transit network with searching for the best fits

Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Background Though leadership has been highlighted as a salient skill for
   medical teachers in the medical education literature, the role of
   authentic leadership style among medical teachers in activating medical
   students' learning behaviors has not been explored. Our study seeks to
   examine the effects of medical teachers' authentic leadership on study
   task crafting behaviors among medical students. Methods Our study
   adopted a mixed-methods research design comprising observations of 100
   surgical operations and 100 ward conferences led by medical teachers,
   and surveys on authentic leadership, study task crafting, and promotion
   focus. Structural equation modelling was utilized in the data analysis.
   Results Medical teachers' authentic leadership demonstrated positive
   effects on the two study task crafting behaviors (seeking resources (B =
   0.36, p < 0.001) and seeking challenges (B = 0.21, p < 0.05)) but not on
   reducing study task demands (B = 0.11, p > 0.10). Promotion focus was
   found to strengthen such positive effects of authentic leadership on
   seeking resources (B = 0.23, p < 0.05) and seeking challenges (B = 0.18,
   p < 0.05). Illustrative excerpts of intraoperative and conference
   conversations are presented. Conclusions Our study provided empirical
   evidence that medical students guided by authentic teachers expressed
   increased levels of study task crafting, which were further increased if
   medical students were promotion-focused.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Typhoid fever remains a public health concern in South
   Africa, where the risk of transmission is high because of poor access to
   safe water and sanitation. This study describes the investigation of
   typhoid fever outbreak in Limpopo province.
   Methodology: Following notification of laboratory-confirmed cases, a
   descriptive study was conducted at Sekhukhune District, Limpopo
   province. A suspected case was defined as any person residing in
   Makhuduthamaga Municipality from November 2017 to January 2018,
   presenting with fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. Data were collected
   using case investigation forms. Whole-genome sequencing (WCS) was
   carried out on Salmonella Typhi isolates and polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) test was done for Salmonella species from water samples. Location
   of cases and water sources were mapped using ArcGIS mapping tool.
   Results: Amongst 122 cases, 54\% (n = 66) were female and 6\% (n = 7)
   laboratory-confirmed. The median age of the cases was 11 years (range
   2-83 years), with 79\% (n = 102) being children under the age of 14
   years. Salmonella species were detected in 37\% (10/27) of water samples
   and geographic information system (GIS) mapping showed clustering of
   cases in TswaingKgwaripe and Vlakplaas villages. Six isolates were
   available for WCS analysis, with resulting data showing that five of the
   six isolates were genetically related. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
   the five isolates clustered together were genetically related showing <
   22 single nucleotide polymorphisms when compared to each other.
   Conclusion: Molecular epidemiology of isolates suggests a common source
   outbreak, supported by the detection of Salmonella species from water
   sources.
   Consumption of water from contaminated open water sources, because of
   ongoing interruption of municipal water supply, was the likely cause of
   the outbreak. The investigation highlights the importance of consistent
   safe water supply and the ability of district surveillance systems to
   identify and contain outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, Smallholder farming systems (SFS) are recognized as one of the
   most important pillars of rural economic development and poverty
   alleviation because of their contribution to food security. However,
   support for this agricultural sector is hampered by lack of reliable
   information on the distributions and acreage of smallholder fields. This
   information is essential in not only monitoring food security and
   informing markets but also in guiding the determination of levels of
   support required from government by individual farmers. There is urgent
   need for robust techniques that can be used to cost-effectively and
   time-efficiently map smallholder crop fields especially in Sub-Saharan
   Africa and Asia. This study attempts to do this by using an approach in
   which optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are systematically
   combined and classified using Extreme Gradient Boosting (Xgboost). We
   also investigated model stacking as another technique to improve
   classification accuracy. We combined Xgboost with Random Forest (RF),
   Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and
   Naive Bayes (NB). The combined use of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 bands,
   spectral indices, and Sentinel-1 produced better results than exclusive
   use of optical data (alpha = 0.95,p= 0.0005). Furthermore, stacking of
   classification algorithms based on model comparisons achieved higher
   accuracy than stacking the algorithms indiscriminately (alpha = 0.95,p=
   0.0100). Through systematic fusion of SAR and optical data and
   hyper-parameter tuning of Xgboost, we achieved a maximum classification
   accuracy of 97.71\%, while achieving a maximum accuracy of 96.06\%
   through model stacking. This highlights the importance of multi-sensor
   data fusion and multi-classifier systems when mapping fragmented
   agricultural landscapes.}},

Title = {{Familial Influences, Shame, Guilt, and Depression Among Sexual Minority
   Adolescents}},
Journal = {{FAMILY RELATIONS}},
Abstract = {{Objective This study examined the mediating effects of self-conscious
   emotions (i.e., shame and guilt) on the relationships between familial
   influences and depressive symptoms among sexual minority adolescents
   (SMAs).
   Background Familial influences, such as family rejection or parental
   affirmation, are associated with depression. However, little research
   has been conducted to identify specific mechanisms that can explain the
   associations between familial influences and depressive symptoms among
   SMAs.
   Method Participants were 94 adolescents, aged 12 to 18 years, who were
   recruited through the community and completed self-report measures.
   Results Family rejection was associated with more feelings of shame and
   guilt, whereas parent affirmation was associated with less shame and
   guilt. Shame and guilt were associated with more depressive symptoms.
   Indirect effects of family rejection on depression were significant
   through shame but not guilt. Indirect effects of parental affirmation on
   depression were significant through shame and guilt.
   Conclusion The results help identify mechanisms through which familial
   influences may be associated with depressive symptoms. Shame and guilt
   are important modifiable psychological factors that can be targets of
   intervention for SMAs.
   Implications Future research and interventions must incorporate familial
   influences as well as self-conscious emotions to improve the mental
   health of SMAs.}},

   diverse instruments. The adsorption property of fibers was evaluated by
   different adsorption models. The maximum adsorption capacity is 340.42
   mg/g at pH 4.0 at ambient temperature. The adsorption isotherm and
   kinetic models were in accord with the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order
   models, respectively, showing that the adsorption behavior was dominated
   by monolayer chemsorption. Langmuir and D-R models were agreed with the
   adsorption isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic model was best

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{The extent and importance of functional heterogeneity and crosstalk
   between tumor cells is poorly understood. Here, we describe the
   generation of clonal populations from a patient-derived ovarian clear
   cell carcinoma model which forms malignant ascites and solid peritoneal
   tumors upon intraperitoneal transplantation in mice. The clonal
   populations are engineered with secreted Gaussia luciferase to monitor
   tumor growth dynamics and tagged with a unique DNA barcode to track
   their fate in multiclonal mixtures during tumor progression. Only one
   clone, CL31, grows robustly, generating exclusively malignant ascites.
   However, multiclonal mixtures form large solid peritoneal metastases,
   populated almost entirely by CL31, suggesting that transient cooperative
   interclonal interactions are sufficient to promote metastasis of CL31.
   CL31 uniquely harbors ERBB2 amplification, and its acquired metastatic
   activity in clonal mixtures is dependent on transient exposure to
   amphiregulin, which is exclusively secreted by non-tumorigenic clones.
   Amphiregulin enhances CL31 mesothelial clearance, a prerequisite for
   metastasis. These findings demonstrate that transient, ostensibly
   innocuous tumor subpopulations can promote metastases via
   ``hit-and-run{''} commensal interactions. Cooperative interactions among
   tumor cells may have important implications for metastasis. Here, the
   authors examined the spatio-temporal nature of interactions among clonal
   populations of ovarian carcinoma cells and found that transient
   interactions cells can promote metastases via commensal interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in aqueous solution and also in
   suspension of contaminated soil with hydrazine has been investigated
   thoroughly. The effects of the major parameters such as concentrations
   of Cr(VI) and hydrazine and their mole ratio, the fraction of soil in
   suspension, pH and temperature on the rate of reduction have been
   studied. Suspended oil has a strong catalytic effect on the process, a
   phenomenon not hitherto reported in the literature. With 33.3\% soil in
   suspension, complete reduction of Cr(VI) was achieved in 4 hr with 33\%
   excess hydrazine. But the time reduces to 20 minutes if four times the
   stoichiometric quantity of hydrazine is used. A simplified mechanistic
   model for the reduction reaction rather than the phenomenological
   approach adopted by some of the earlier researchers has been developed
   on the basis of two-electron transfer pathway leading to a second-order
   rate form. Experimental rate data fitted satisfactorily in the equation
   and the rate constant could be evaluated using the integrated form of
   the equation. The rate constant depends linearly on soil concentration;
   the logarithm of the rate constant is linear in pH over the range 4-10.
   The activation energy for the reaction is 34 kJ/mol. Sonication of an
   aqueous solution of Cr(VI) significantly enhances the reaction, the rate
   constant being doubled at a sonication frequency of 30 kHz. Effect of
   sonication is also significant in presence of suspended soil. Complete
   reduction of Cr(VI) with stoichiometric dosing of hydrazine was achieved
   under sonication in a much smaller reaction time. Treatment with
   hydrazine in the slurry phase especially with sonication will prove to
   be a practically effectiveex situstrategy of remediation of a large
   number of Cr(VI)-contaminated sites worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   Construction practices used in the development of self-help housing and
   upgrade of informal settlements are believed to have negative effects on
   the natural environment. The purpose of this paper is to examine this
   idea by conducting a study on purposely selected informal settlements
   located in Mbabane, Kingdom of Eswatini, to determine the environmental
   sustainability of construction practices used in these areas and to
   offer an approach that can mitigate the environmental degradation
   witnessed in informal settlements.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study comprised of three major components - literature review,
   situational analysis and research output. A literature review informed
   the extent of the problem and served to identify categories of
   assessment. A situational analysis of construction practices in informal
   settlements was done through the use of a structured checklist tool.
   Pattern matching was used as an analysis to evaluate the environmental
   sustainability of the identified construction practices.
   Findings
   Empirical results indicate a lack of environmental sustainability in the
   identified construction practices used. The challenges identified
   included the wrong choice of building material, inefficiency in energy
   use, a threat to biodiversity, poor planning and a lack of construction
   control measures. The research output was a framework encouraging
   affordable, sustainable and regenerative construction practices believed
   to be a viable solution to the environmental challenges within informal
   settlements. It was concluded that current construction practices used
   within informal settlements lead to negative environmental effects.
   Originality/value
   The framework offered in this study is believed to mitigate the negative
   effects on the natural environment in informal settlements.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{To describe the state of polarization (SOP) of light, the Stokes
   parameters are obtained using intensity measurements made at different
   component polarization states. Using these Stokes parameters, complex
   field distributions called Stokes fields can be synthesized, and the
   phase singularities present in these Stokes fields are called Stokes
   vortices. The SOP of a Stokes vortex can be either linear or circular at
   the singular point. Of the three types of Stokes vortices, only one of
   them has handedness associated with it. We show here that changing the
   handedness of this Stokes vortex results in index sign inversion for the
   other two types of Stokes vortices. To accomplish handedness inversion
   without Stokes index sign inversion, a new phase engineering method is
   introduced here. The current study may unfold applications in the
   optical chirality measurement and structured illumination microscopy.

   Well Conditioning of Rule-Based Channel Reservoir Models}},
Journal = {{NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Constructing subsurface models that accurately reproduce geological
   heterogeneity and their associated uncertainty is critical to many
   geoscience and engineering applications. For hydrocarbon reservoir
   modeling and forecasting, for example, spatial variability must be
   consistent with geological processes, geophysical measurements, and time
   records of fluid production measurements. Generating such subsurface
   models can be time-consuming; conditioning them to different types of
   measurements is even more computationally intensive and technically
   challenging. Using too many free variables can cause overfitting of the
   data, thereby decreasing the predictive ability of the model; high
   dimensionality also slows convergence during history matching of fluid
   production measurements. To contend with these problems, we introduce
   here a new machine learning approach, referred to as the stochastic
   pix2pix method, which parameterizes high-dimensional, stochastic
   reservoir models into low-dimensional Gaussian random variables in
   latent space. Many of the world's significant hydrocarbon fields
   originate from fluvial or turbidite deposits, with sedimentary processes
   and spatial distribution of rock facies significantly influencing their
   flow behavior. Rule- or object-based methods are commonly used to model
   geostatistically these types of reservoirs. Here, we introduce a new and
   efficient machine learning-based reservoir modeling workflow capable of
   generating 2D fluvial reservoir models that account for the available
   field data and the geometries of different facies. By constraining
   subsurface model realizations to available geophysical and petrophysical
   interpretations, multiphysics inversion can be greatly accelerated,
   thereby requiring only production history matching. Although our models
   are 2D, an extension to 3D can be readily implemented through
   zone-by-zone (i.e., reservoir unit) modeling and conditioning. The
   proposed method and workflow also partially solve the common problem of
   machine learning methods, wherein mapping low- to high-resolution images
   often yield reduced spatial variability. The proposed method is an
   extension of conditional generative adversarial networks, in which we
   incorporate a novel penalty term into the loss function in order to
   generate various realizations honoring the same conditional data, such
   as structural interpretation from seismic data, and borehole
   measurements at key well locations. We ``train{''} the generative model
   on geologically realistic, multivariate spatial models generated with a
   rule-based fluvial reservoir simulator. Each high-resolution training
   image includes five lithofacies with distinct petrophysical property
   trends. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, visual
   inspection, indicator variograms and multiple point density function are
   applied to gauge how well the realizations reproduce existing patterns
   in the true model. A new metric, the mean categorical error, is proposed
   to quantify how well the realizations match the conditioning data. The
   proposed method correctly reproduces patterns even when the conditioning
   data are significantly different from those in the training set.
   Likewise, the method can perform continuous model modifications, meaning
   that the machine learning procedure effectively reproduces the migration
   rule of a meandering (fluvial) system.}},

   Hypothesis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Interstitial pneumonia was the first manifestation to be recognized as
   caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2);
   however, in just a few weeks, it became clear that the coronavirus
   disease-2019 (COVID-19) overrun tissues and more body organs than just
   the lungs, so much so that it could be considered a systemic pathology.
   Several studies reported the involvement of the conjunctiva, the gut,
   the heart and its pace, and vascular injuries such as thromboembolic
   complications and Kawasaki disease in children and toddlers were also
   described. More recently, it was reported that in a sample of 214
   SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, 36.4\% complained of neurological symptoms
   ranging from non-specific manifestations (dizziness, headache, and
   seizures), to more specific symptoms such hyposmia or hypogeusia, and
   stroke. Older individuals, especially males with comorbidities, appear
   to be at the highest risk of developing such severe complications
   related to the Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement.
   Neuropsychiatric manifestations in COVID-19 appear to develop in
   patients with and without pre-existing neurological disorders. Growing
   evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human
   Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) for the attachment and entrance
   inside host cells. By describing ACE2 and the whole Renin Angiotensin
   Aldosterone System (RAAS) we may better understand whether specific cell
   types may be affected by SARS-CoV-2 and whether their functioning can be
   disrupted in case of an infection. Since clear evidences of neurological
   interest have already been shown, by clarifying the topographical
   distribution and density of ACE2, we will be able to speculate how
   SARS-CoV-2 may affect the CNS and what is the pathogenetic mechanism by
   which it contributes to the specific clinical manifestations of the
   disease. Based on such evidences, we finally hypothesize the process of
   SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the CNS and provide a possible explanation for
   the onset or the exacerbation of some common neuropsychiatric disorders
   in the elderly including cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease.}},

   factor-BB, vascular endothelial growth factor, and SLIT3, had a higher
   expression in three ADO II subjects than in 15 healthy age-matched and
   sex-matched controls. Moreover, the conditioned medium was obtained from
   preosteoclast induced from the ADO II patients' peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells. It was found to promote the CD31(hi)EMCN(hi) vessel
   formation of human microvascular endothelial cells and osteogenic
   differentiation of bone marrow-derived stem cells. Taken together, our
   finding revealed a novel CLCN7 variant associated with ADO II and
   suggested that the sclerotic bone was potentially associated with the
   increase of the CD31(hi)EMCN(hi) vessel formation and bone formation.}},

Title = {{Effects of Cultured Cordycep militaris on Sexual Performance and
   Erectile Function in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Male Rats}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Cordyceps militaris (CM), a valuable edible and medicinal fungus, has
   been used as traditional medicine to treat health conditions, as well as
   hyposexuality in Asian societies for over a century. Due to the high
   demand, several artificial cultivation methods have been developed for
   their biological activities. In this study, CM was cultured on medium
   that contained white rice and silkworm pupae, and the levels of
   cordycepin and adenosine, as well as its aphrodisiac effects in
   diabetes-induced erectile dysfunction (DIED), were evaluated. Diabetic
   rats were induced by streptozotocin (STZ) injection and administered
   orally with CM (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 g/kg BW/day) for 3 weeks. Diabetic
   rats in negative and positive control groups received vehicle and
   sildenafil citrate (5 mg/kg), respectively. Results showed the changes
   in mating behaviour in which mount latency and intromission latency were
   significantly increased in diabetic rats, compared with the normal
   control group. Diabetic rats also showed a significant reduction in
   intracavernosal pressure (ICP) response to cavernous nerve stimulation,
   sperm count, testosterone level, penile nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and
   testicular superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, when compared to the
   normal control group. Administration of CM (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 g/kg
   BW/day) reversed the effects of diabetes on the mating behaviour, and
   the ICP responses to electrical stimulation. Moreover, the levels of
   penile NOS, testicular SOD activities, testosterone, and sperm count
   were significantly increased, and testicular malondialdehyde (MDA)
   levels were significantly decreased in these treated diabetic rats.
   Diabetic rats treated with sildenafil showed a significant induction in
   intromission frequency and NOS and SOD activities, as well as a marked
   increase in ICP responses. These results suggest that CCM exerts its
   aphrodisiac effect, possibly through activating testosterone production
   and suppressing oxidative stress to enhance erectile function in
   diabetic rats.}},

   hoodies, schools, grades, and media constructions of multi-talented
   `supergirls.' This analysis highlights the importance of an
   intersectional approach to academic success alongside an understanding
   that inequalities, such as sexism, still endure for smart girls. We
   conclude by emphasizing the power of materiality in girls' everyday
   lives to shift understandings of self, school, and smartness, as well as
   the importance of moving beyond dichotomous and decontextualized

Abstract = {{Polymer science offers a great insight and a new research dimension for
   biomedical applications. The synthesis of polymeric materials by the
   physical ways provides several advantages over the conventional chemical
   methods. It is though expansive but less toxic, stable, and efficiently
   reproducible. In the present report, electrospinning was used for
   bio-composite preparation. The bio-composite was developed using
   polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and curcumin. The electrospun fiber
   bio-composite were analyzed for antibacterial activity, bacterial
   filtration capability, and endotoxin elimination. The bio-composite was
   analyzed for physical structure and properties using Scanning Electron
   Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and Fourier
   Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy (FT-IR). PVA solely was not able to
   exhibit any of the antibacterial or endotoxin removal properties.
   However, the curcumin-based bio-composite was found to be bactericidal
   and endotoxin eliminator. The bio-composite was able to remove 100\% of
   endotoxin and nearly 100\% of the bacterial cells. The endotoxin removal
   properties of bio-composite were found to be excellent fit under
   Langmuir curve with a R-2 value of 0.98. Additionally, the effect of
   bio-composite was also studied over protein content in the sample and
   L-asparaginase activity. However, the effect observed was negligible.}},

Title = {{Simulation of Central Indian Ocean Mode in S2S Models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},

Volume = {{125}},

Abstract = {{Simulation of monsoon intraseasonal oscillations (MISO) during the
   Indian summer monsoon (ISM) is a grand scientific challenge. The
   Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) prediction project provides a unique way
   to examine the key dynamics of MISO. Recently, a Central Indian Ocean
   (CIO) mode was proposed as an intrinsic climate mode over the Indian
   Ocean, and it has a close relation with MISO during the ISM. In this
   study, the simulations of the CIO mode events in S2S models are
   examined. The results confirm that a better rendition of the CIO mode in
   S2S models tends to result in a better simulation of northward
   propagating MISO and leads to stronger subseasonal rainfall during the
   ISM. The positive CIO mode cases are classified into well-simulated and
   poorly simulated groups. It is shown that the barotropic energy
   conversion due to the meridional shear of background zonal winds (
   partial differential u over bar partial differential y) enhances the
   kinetic energy at subseasonal timescales during the CIO mode in the
   well-simulated group, which also agrees with observations. As a result,
   the enhanced meridional wind anomalies transport moisture from the
   tropics to the subtropics and reinforce midtropospheric moisture loading
   in the subtropics, which nourishes the northward propagating MISO.
   Therefore, a better simulation of partial differential u over bar /
   partial differential y and moisture transport by subseasonal meridional
   wind anomalies are required to improve the CIO mode simulation, which is
   expected to benefit the simulation and prediction of MISO during the
   ISM.}},

Abstract = {{One of the defect for polymers based film is the low thermal
   conductivity which restricts their application. In this study, an
   effective strategy in improving the thermal conductivity of
   poly(butylene succinate) phosphorus-containing ionomer
   {[}phosphorus-containing ionic group (PCIG) content was 1wt\%, denoted
   as PBSI1-K] by compression molding was proposed. PBSI1-K films with
   anisotropic thermal transport were fabricated by thermal compression
   molding with different compression molding pressure (2000, 2500, 3000,
   and 3500 psi). The relationships between the compression molding
   pressure and properties, including thermal conductivity, crystallization
   behavior and chain orientation degree of PBSI1-K films were
   investigated. Strikingly, PBSI1-K film fabricated at 2500 psi pressure,
   denoted as PBSI1-K-2500, achieved 5-fold increase in in-plane thermal
   conductivity when PBS was used as the contrast. The impressive improved
   thermal conductivity (542 mW m(-1) K-1) in horizontal direction are
   ascribed to the fact that PBSI1-K-2500 obtained the large spherulite
   diameter (517 um) and high chain orientation degree (1.90). Furthermore,
   we introduced graphene into PBSI1-K and the thermal conductivity of
   GNS/PBSI1-K composites have also been discussed. We hence showcase
   compression molding here as a facile strategy to prepare ionomer film
   with improved thermal conductivity. The prepared PBSI1-K-2500 can serve
   as biodegradable films to replace petroleum-based plastic materials and
   remedy the pollution of ``microplastics.{''}}},

Abstract = {{A new one-step hybrid block method with third derivatives and optimized
   features aimed at solving the classical one-dimensional Bratu's and
   Reactor design problems is developed. The development of the new method
   considers three intermediate points that are properly chosen through the
   optimization of the local truncation errors corresponding to the main
   formulas to approximate the solution and the first derivative at the end
   point of the block, and another approximation of the solution at an
   intermediate point. The convergence analysis and the order of the
   proposed method are analyzed. Some specific problems are solved to
   demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of the technique adopted. The
   numerical results provided through the implementation of the scheme are
   very much closer to the exact solutions and are found favorably compared
   with different methods in the available literature.}},

Abstract = {{We report on a detailed study of terahertz (THz) photoresistivity in a
   strained HgTe three-dimensional topological insulator (3D TI) for all
   Fermi level positions: inside the conduction and valence bands and in
   the bulk gap. In the presence of a magnetic field, we detect a resonance
   corresponding to the cyclotron resonance (CR) in the top surface Dirac
   fermions (DFs) and examine the nontrivial dependence of the surface
   state cyclotron mass on the Fermi level position. We also detect
   additional resonant features at moderate electron densities and
   demonstrate that they are caused by the mixing of surface DFs and bulk
   electrons. At high electron densities, we observe THz radiation-induced
   1/B-periodic low-field magneto-oscillations coupled to harmonics of the
   CR and demonstrate that they have a common origin with microwaveinduced
   resistance oscillations previously observed in high mobility GaAs-based
   heterostructures. This observation attests the superior quality of a 2D
   electron system formed by helical surface states in strained HgTe films.

Title = {{Contact repellency by l-menthol is mediated by TRPM channels in the red

Journal = {{PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{77}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Among insects, beetles are one of the most destructive pests
   of agricultural and stored products. Researchers have been investigating
   alternatives to pesticides for more sustainable pest management. Here,
   we focused on insect transient receptor potential (TRP) channel-targeted
   repellency. Among transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM)
   channels, mammalian TRPM8 is activated by menthol and its derivatives,
   but few previous studies have reported on whether the insect TRPM
   channel is activated by chemical compounds. Here, we investigated
   whether the TRPM channel (TcTRPM) of the red flour beetle Tribolium
   castaneum (Herbst), a major stored-products pest, mediated the repellent
   behavior of l-menthol and its derivatives.
   RESULTS We initially investigated the repellent activity of l-menthol
   and menthoxypropanediol (MPD) against T. castaneum. The laboratory
   bioassay revealed that the repellent activities of l-menthol and MPD
   were dose dependent. RNA interference was used for transcriptional
   knockdown of TcTRPM and revealed that a reduced transcript level
   resulted in a significant decrease in l-menthol and MPD repellent
   activities. However, no significant decrease was observed for
   N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) repellency. The most abundant
   TcTRPM transcripts were observed in the antennae. However,
   antennae-plucked beetles maintained their repellent behavior with
   l-menthol.
   CONCLUSION The repellent activities of l-menthol and MPD for T.
   castaneum are mediated by TcTRPM, and it was suggested that the
   olfactory response is not adequate for avoidance, but that contact
   repellency might be a more important repellant method.}},

Abstract = {{The central transport channel (CTC) of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) is
   made up of three nucleoporins Nup62, Nup58 and Nup54. In which manner
   and capacity, these nucleoporins form the CTC, is not yet clear. We
   explored the CTC Nups from various species and observed that distinct
   biochemical characteristics of CTC Nups are evolutionarily conserved.
   Moreover, comparative biochemical analysis of CTC complexes showed
   various stoichiometric combinations of Nup62, Nup54 and Nup58 coexisting
   together. We observed the conserved amino-terminal domain of mammalian
   Nup93 is crucial for the anchorage of CTC and its localization to NPCs.
   We could reconstitute and purify mammalian CTC center dot Nup93
   quaternary complex by co-expressing full length or N-terminal domain of
   Nup93 along with CTC complex. Further, we characterized CTC center dot
   Nup93 complex using small angle X-ray scattering and electron microscopy
   that revealed a ``V{''} shape of CTC center dot Nup93 complex. Overall,
   this study demonstrated for the first time evolutionarily conserved
   plasticity and stoichiometric diversity in CTC Nups.}},

   fintech and proptech. Design/methodology/approach This research paper
   examines Industry 4.0 technology to construct a framework for Real
   Estate 4.0. We also focus on how the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating
   proptech, particularly as it relates to getting employees back into
   their traditional work environments. Findings As a research paper, this
   is not a traditional research project with empirical findings. It is a
   primer on how the rapidly changing technologies of Industry 4.0 are now
   disrupting and transforming real estate today into what we are calling
   Real Estate 4.0. Practical implications Practitioner insight and future
   research are informed by a framework for Real Estate 4.0 drawn from the
   technologies of Industry 4.0. Additional implications are outlined for
   practical, systemic change as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic within
   the scope of Real Estate 4.0 technology. Originality/value This is a
   combined effort by experts in three contributing disciplines: systems
   science, planning and real estate. Our intent is to provide a primer for
   those of us in the latter two fields so that we can embrace the rapidly
   changing built environment landscape as it adjusts and adapts to a post
   COVID-19 environment that will be critical to maintain real estate

Abstract = {{Inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite with an optical bandgap ranging from 1.67 to
   1.75 eV is a promising light-harvesting material as a top cell in tandem
   solar cells, but its high fabrication temperature can damage the middle
   layers or the bottom subcells. Here, an additive-involved leaching
   method to fabricate CsPbI3 perovskite films is demonstrated, which can
   decrease the preparation temperature to 100 degrees C. The CsPbI3
   perovskite films with high crystallinity are achieved by a solution
   assisted reaction between DMAPbI(3) and Cs4PbI6 with the leaching of
   DMA(+), Cs+, and I-. The as-prepared CsPbI3 perovskite films exhibit
   much superior stability compared to their high-temperature counterparts.
   As a result, a power conversion efficiency of over 16\% is obtained, and
   the unencapsulated device maintains over 93\% of the initial efficiency
   after aging for 30 days in air with a relative humidity of 10\%.}},

Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Background Individuals with normal weight obesity (NWO) are predisposed
   to having cardiometabolic disorders. This study aims to investigate the
   circulating levels of vaspin, leptin and their association with glycemic
   and lipid profiles in women with NWO. Methods Forty women with body mass
   index (BMI) = 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2) and fat mass (FM) >= 30\% were assigned
   in the NWO group. Thirty age-matched women with identical BMI range, and
   FM < 30\% (normal weight non-obese; NWNO) were considered as a control
   group. In addition to anthropometric measurements, glycemic and lipid
   profiles and circulating levels of leptin and vaspin were measured.
   Results The mean +/- standard deviation (SD) age of participants was
   28.76 +/- 4.76 years in the NWO group and 29.23 +/- 4.50 years in the
   control group. The NWO group had the higher mean serum levels of insulin
   (9.02 +/- 4.75 vs. 6.24 +/- 2.51, P = 0.009), leptin (17.31 +/- 8.10 vs.
   9.94 +/- 4.30, P < 0.001) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin
   resistance (HOMA-IR) (33.77 +/- 20.71 vs. 23.48 +/- 10.03, P = 0.009)
   compared to the NWNO group. The serum level of vaspin was higher in the
   NWO group compared to the control group (34.82 pg/ml vs. 27.72 pg/ml,
   respectively, P = 0.12). In NWO group, the serum levels of leptin had
   positive correlation with FBS (r = 0.45, P = 0.02), insulin (r = 0.51, P
   = 0.008), and HOMA-IR (r = 0.46, P = 0.02) and vaspin concentration was
   associated with insulin (r = 0.36, P = 0.02) and HOMA-IR (r = 0.30, P =
   0.06), positively. Conclusion It is concluded that the concentration of
   insulin and HOMA-IR index were significantly higher in women with NWO
   compared to NWNO. Higher concentrations of leptin and vaspin in the NWO
   group were associated with glycemic profile.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are proposed to be used
   as a quality loss function for Six Sigma projects. An industrial data
   set consisting of power consumption rates of refrigerators and thermal
   camera readings around their compressors is analysed. For industrial
   data, relationships between inputs and outputs can be nonlinear and
   complex. Therefore, traditional statistical models may result in poor
   inferences. At this point, ANNs emerge as effective tools because of
   their ability to learn nonlinear and complex relationships. While Six
   Sigma remains as the major quality initiative, its popularity started to
   decline among industrial practitioners. Since the methodology was
   established, Six Sigma toolbox was not radically improved. Therefore, to
   enhance Six Sigma toolbox, an ANN-based structure is proposed to detect
   the refrigerators not complying with power specifications through
   thermal camera readings. Four quality loss function models are compared:
   one-dimensional parabolic Taguchi loss functions, multivariate Maximum
   Likelihood cost, logistic regression and finally ANNs. The analyses are
   conducted by Monte Carlo cross-validation to obtain precision-recall
   curves for these methods. The ANN-based cost function is shown to
   outperform other three methods. Finally, ANNs are found to be an
   effective tool which may bring new dimensions to Six Sigma concept.}},

Title = {{Gene duplication, rather than epigenetic changes, drives FGF4

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Gastrointestinal stromal tumours that are wild type for KIT and PDGFRA
   are referred to as WT GISTs. Of these tumours, SDH-deficient
   (characterized by the loss of SDHB) and quadruple WT GIST
   (KIT/PDGFRA/SDH/RAS-P WT) subgroups were reported to display a marked
   overexpression of FGF4, identifying a putative common therapeutic target
   for the first time. In SDH-deficient GISTs, methylation of an FGF
   insulator region was found to be responsible for the induction of FGF4
   expression. In quadruple WT, recurrent focal duplication of FGF3/FGF4
   was reported; however, how it induced FGF4 expression was not
   investigated. To assess whether overexpression of FGF4 in quadruple WT
   could be driven by similar epigenetic mechanisms as in SDH-deficient
   GISTs, we performed global and locus-specific (on FGF4 and FGF
   insulator) methylation analyses. However, no epigenetic alterations were
   detected. Conversely, we demonstrated that in quadruple WT GISTs, FGF4
   expression and the structure of the duplication were intimately
   connected, with the copy of FGF4 closer to the ANO1 super-enhancer being
   preferentially expressed. In conclusion, we demonstrated that in
   quadruple WT GISTs, FGF4 overexpression is not due to an epigenetic
   mechanism but rather to the specific genomic structure of the
   duplication. Even if FGF4 overexpression is driven by different
   molecular mechanisms, these findings support an increasing biologic
   relevance of the FGFR pathway in WT GISTs, both in SDH-deficient and
   quadruple WT GISTs, suggesting that it may be a common therapeutic
   target.}},

Title = {{The Electric Riverboat Charging Station Location Problem}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, the electric mobility is mainly focused on urban areas.
   However, the use of Photovoltaic-assisted Charging Stations (PVCSs) can
   contribute to implement the electric mobility in rural areas
   disconnected from the national grid. Inspired by the new river
   operations with an Electric Boat (EB), we introduce a new location
   problem named the Electric Riverboat Charging Station Location Problem
   (ERCSLP). This problem estimates the necessary infrastructure for an EB
   to be able to perform a round trip. In this case, we decide the location
   of the PVCSs and the size of the EB battery aiming to minimize the sum
   of the PVCS and the EB battery costs. In this problem, we include the
   nonlinear behavior of the charging function and the variation of the
   solar radiation. For solving this problem, we propose a Mixed-Integer
   Linear Programming (MILP) formulation. For testing this MILP
   formulation, we build a set of instances based on real river transport
   operations that have the potential to migrate to the electric mobility.
   In our computational experiments, we show that our MILP formulation can
   find the optimal solution of the instances. Finally, we perform a
   sensitivity analysis and an economic viability analysis of the electric
   mobility in these operations.}},

Abstract = {{The coherent interaction of Rydberg helium atoms with microwave fields
   in a
   lambda / 4 superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator has been
   exploited to probe the spectral characteristics of an individual
   resonator mode. This was achieved by preparing the atoms in the 1s55s
   S-3(1) Rydberg level by resonance enhanced two-color two-photon
   excitation from the metastable 1s2s(3)S(1) level. The atoms then
   traveled over the resonator in which the third harmonic microwave field,
   at a frequency of
   omega
   res = 2 pi x 19.556GHz, drove the two-photon 1s55s(3)S(1) ->
   1s56s(3)S(1) transition. By injecting a sequence of Ramsey pulses into
   the resonator and monitoring the coherent evolution of the Rydberg state
   population by state-selective pulsed electric field ionization as the
   frequency of the microwave field was tuned, spectra were recorded that
   allowed the resonator resonance frequency and quality factor to be
   determined with the atoms acting as microscopic quantum sensors.}},

   procedure incorporates the geomechanics concepts, and it can be solved
   by coupling computational fluid dynamics and soil particles. Based on
   numerical investigations considering soil particles, cases of scour
   prediction considering soil layer distributions have been carried out.
   With this concept, scour processes in layer-distributed soils and under
   different flood consequences have been analysed. It can be applied to
   investigate the scour process considering layered soils with different
   erosion resistance distributions and various hydraulic conditions. It is
   found that the proposed model can provide reliable results and explain a
   few scour phenomena, which are difficult to explain with traditional
   models.}},

Abstract = {{In order to explore the comprehensive utilisation and recycling
   technology of Caragana korshinskii resources, a new agricultural biomass
   waste, 15 kinds of Caragana korshinskii biochar (CB) were prepared by
   controlling the pyrolysis temperature and time at the anaerobic
   environment. Moreover, we pay more attention to deriving the adsorption
   mechanisms and exploring the difference in adsorption characteristics of
   Pb2+ and Cd2+. The optimal preparation conditions and the batch
   adsorption experiments were evaluated, and the adsorption
   characteristics and mechanisms were discussed using 8 theoretical
   adsorption models and multiple characterisation methods. The results
   showed that the CB prepared at 650 degrees C for 3 h presented the best
   performance. The Langmuir and Freundlich models can well simulate the
   isotherm adsorption process of CB for Pb2+ and Cd2+, respectively. The
   adsorption kinetics of CB for Pb2+ and Cd2+ were best fitted by the
   pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption equilibrium for Pb2+ and Cd2+
   was reached within 3 h, and their maximum adsorption capacity reached
   220.94 mg g(-1) and 42.43 mg g(-1), respectively. In addition, the best
   addition amount was 3 g L-1 and 2.2 g L-1 for Pb2+ and Cd2+,
   respectively. The optimum pH range was 3-6 for Pb2+ and 6-7.5 for Cd2+.
   The adsorption mechanisms of CB for Pb2+ and Cd2+ were physicochemical
   composite adsorption processes, mainly including physical sorption on
   surface sites, intraparticle diffusion, electrostatic adsorption,
   ion/ligand exchange, cationic-pi interactions, surface complexation and
   precipitation. Furthermore, the ash of CB also presented a positive
   effect on the adsorption of Pb2+. Compared with other cellulose- and
   lignin-based biomass materials, CB showed low cost and efficient
   performance without complicated modification conditions. Therefore, this
   study demonstrates that CB is a promising raw material in water
   pollution control to immobilise heavy metals.}},

   self-esteem were administered. Narratives were coded for themes of
   redemption (bad beginnings, positive endings) and exploration (engaging
   with the experience's emotional implications). After controlling for
   relevant covariates (e.g., story length), participants who formed
   redemptive stories of their partner's infidelity evinced higher levels
   of forgiveness and lower levels of empathy (Study 1), whereas
   participants who disclosed redemptive stories about their own infidelity
   demonstrated decreased forgiveness (Study 2). Across studies,
   exploratory narratives corresponded positively with conscientiousness.}},

Abstract = {{This article reflects upon the experiences of two perinatal, hospital
   social workers during the unprecedented time of the Covid-19 in Ireland,
   as discussed with their academic colleague. This encounter revealed the
   complexity of service delivery that emerged, when managing the needs of
   vulnerable clients whilst being mindful of personal safety. One of the
   social workers was pregnant so was conscious of possible risks to her
   unborn child, as well as her young family at home. The second social
   worker, her line manager, discusses the dilemmas associated with the
   management of risk when allocating staff to contexts where they would be
   in direct contact with Covid-19. At the core of the analysis of these
   situations is the notion of liminal space and the realisation that time
   appears to have a new meaning; what we once knew as normal no longer
   exists, but we have yet to reach the `new normal'.}},

Abstract = {{Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) are cryptic and currently face regional
   extinction. The direct detection (physical sighting) of individuals is
   required to improve conservation management strategies. We provide a
   comparative assessment of three survey methods for the direct detection
   of koalas: systematic spotlighting (Spotlight), remotely piloted
   aircraft system thermal imaging (RPAS), and the refined diurnal radial
   search component of the spot assessment technique (SAT). Each survey
   method was repeated on the same morning with independent observers
   (03:00-12:00 hrs) for a total of 10 survey occasions at sites with fixed
   boundaries (28-76 ha) in Port Stephens (n = 6) and Gilead (n = 1) in New
   South Wales between May and July 2019. Koalas were directly detected on
   22 occasions during 7 of 10 comparative surveys (Spotlight: n = 7; RPAS:
   n = 14; and SAT: n = 1), for a total of 12 unique individuals
   (Spotlight: n = 4; RPAS: n = 11; SAT: n = 1). In 3 of 10 comparative
   surveys no koalas were detected. Detection probability was 38.9 +/-
   20.03\% for Spotlight, 83.3 +/- 11.39\% for RPAS and 4.2 +/- 4.17\% for
   SAT. Effective detectability per site was 1 +/- 0.44 koalas per 6.75 +/-
   1.03 hrs for Spotlight (1 koala per 6.75 hrs), 2 +/- 0.38 koalas per
   4.35 +/- 0.28 hrs for RPAS (1 koala per 2.18 hrs) and 0.14 +/- 0.14 per
   6.20 +/- 0.93 hrs for SAT (1 koala per 43.39 hrs). RPAS thermal imaging
   technology appears to offer an efficient method to directly survey
   koalas comparative to Spotlight and SAT and has potential as a valuable
   conservation tool to inform on-ground management of declining koala
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Solar-driven photo-to-chemical conversion is an interesting approach for
   energy harvesting and storage with high sustainability. To achieve high
   photo-to-chemical conversion efficiency, it is important to develop
   cost-effective and stable catalysts with high activity. Metal oxides
   provide an interesting platform for the development of efficient
   catalysts owing to their abundance, high stability, and tunable band
   edges. Their performance highly depends on the rational design of
   heterostructures with engineered electronic structures, modified charge
   migration behavior, tailored interfacial properties, and amplified
   electromagnetic fields. All these enable the achievement of efficient
   light harvesting, promoted charge separation and transport, and
   accelerated surface reactions. Herein, a recent study on rationally
   designed metal oxide heterostructures for enhancing photo-to-chemical
   energy conversion via photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical systems is
   reviewed. The approaches to enhance their conversion efficiency are as
   follows: 1) surface modification via loading of plasmonic metals and
   other photosensitizers; 2) surface regulation, including morphology,
   defect, and dopants; 3) interfacial assembly with metal oxides, other
   metal compounds, and metal-free materials. Moreover, the underlying
   reaction mechanisms of metal oxide-based heterostructures and how they
   affect the energy conversion efficiency are discussed. Finally, the
   challenges and perspectives on the development of metal oxide-based
   heterostructures and associated photo-to-chemical devices are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The common neglect of the prominent bacterial growth and accumulation on
   polymer-based thermal conductive materials used in medical electronic
   devices will hurt the functionality and lifetime of medical devices, and
   sometimes even lead to medical accidents. In this study, we developed a
   novel ternary composite with excellent antimicrobial and thermal
   conductive properties to solve this problem. This composite was composed
   of antimicrobial functionalized hexagonal boron nitride (AB@h-BN)
   nanoplatelets, low melt alloys (LMAs), and epoxy. Antimicrobial testing
   showed that the AB@h-BN/LMAs/epoxy composites were 100\% against both
   Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus; their antibacterial
   mechanism was contact killing and was harmless to the environment.
   Besides enhancing the antimicrobial property, the AB@h-BN nanoplatelets
   connected the mutually independent LMAs, forming the continuous network
   for heat conduction in the epoxy. Benefited from this distinctive
   structure, the thermal conductivity of AB@h-BN/LMAs/epoxy can reach 2.66
   Wm(-1) k(-1), which represented an enhancement of about 1141\% over the
   pure epoxy.}},

Abstract = {{The ultimate functionality and applicability of polymeric nanofibers are
   mainly to subject on its diameter. This study explores the influence of
   melt flow rates (MFRs) of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) on the

   (EVOH) copolymer was added to the nonpolar LDPE as a spinning aid. After
   electrospinning, the EVOH was removed from LDPE/EVOH blend fiber by
   treating with isopropanol/water solution and LDPE nanofiber was obtained
   with a diameter of only 190 +/- 85 nm for the highest MFR. A linear
   diameter reduction was observed for pure LDPE and EVOH removed LDPE
   fiber with the increase of MFR. However, a slight diameter increment was
   reported for the LDPE/EVOH blend fiber with higher MFR due to the
   improved melt viscosity of the component. A massive diameter decrement
   was found after EVOH removal from the blended fiber, resulting in the
   renovation of microfiber to a stable nanoscale dimension.}},

Abstract = {{The airline crew scheduling problem is usually solved sequentially in
   two main steps because of its complexity: the crew pairing followed by
   the crew assignment. However, finding a globally optimal solution via
   the sequential approach may be impossible because the decision domain of
   the crew assignment problem is reduced by decisions made in the pairing
   problem. This study considers the crew scheduling problem in a
   personalized context where each pilot and copilot requests a set of
   preferred flights and vacations each month. We propose a model that
   completely integrates the crew pairing and personalized assignment
   problems to generate personalized monthly schedules for a given set of
   pilots and copilots simultaneously in a single optimization step. The
   model keeps the pairings in the two problems as similar as possible so
   that the propagation of perturbations arising during the operation is
   reduced. We develop an integrated algorithm that combines alternating
   Lagrangian decomposition, column generation, and dynamic constraint
   aggregation. We conduct computational experiments on a set of real
   instances from a major US carrier. Our integrated approach produces
   significant cost savings and better satisfaction of crew preferences
   compared with the traditional sequential approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background Identification of genetic diversity in heat tolerance and
   associated traits is of great importance for improving heat tolerance in
   cool-season grass species. The objectives of this study were to
   determine genetic variations in heat tolerance associated with
   phenotypic and physiological traits and to identify molecular markers
   associated with heat tolerance in a diverse collection of perennial
   ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Results Plants of 98 accessions were
   subjected to heat stress (35/30 degrees C, day/night) or optimal growth
   temperature (25/20 degrees C) for 24 d in growth chambers. Overall heat
   tolerance of those accessions was ranked by principal component analysis
   (PCA) based on eight phenotypic and physiological traits. Among these
   traits, electrolyte leakage (EL), chlorophyll content (Chl), relative
   water content (RWC) had high correlation coefficients (- 0.858, 0.769,
   and 0.764, respectively) with the PCA ranking of heat tolerance. We also
   found expression levels of four Chl catabolic genes (CCGs), including
   LpNYC1, LpNOL, LpSGR, and LpPPH, were significant higher in heat
   sensitive ryegrass accessions then heat tolerant ones under heat stress.
   Furthermore, 66 pairs of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used
   to perform association analysis based on the PCA result. The population
   structure of ryegrass can be grouped into three clusters, and accessions
   in cluster C were relatively more heat tolerant than those in cluster A
   and B. SSR markers significantly associated with above-mentioned traits
   were identified (R-2 > 0.05, p < 0.01)., including two pairs of markers
   located on chromosome 4 in association with Chl content and another four
   pairs of markers in association with EL. Conclusion The result not only
   identified useful physiological parameters, including EL, Chl content,
   and RWC, and their associated SSR markers for heat-tolerance breeding of
   perennial ryegrass, but also highlighted the involvement of Chl
   catabolism in ryegrass heat tolerance. Such knowledge is of significance
   for heat-tolerance breeding and heat tolerance mechanisms in perennial
   ryegrass as well as in other cool-season grass species.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of sodium chloride on pH, total soluble solid, phenolics,
   anthocyanins, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging
   activity (DPPH) of grape juice during storage at 7, 20, and 30 degrees C
   were investigated in this study. The results indicated that during the
   6-day storage, NaCl at concentrations of 17, 42.5, and 85 mmol/L delayed
   the decrease of total anthocyanins and DPPH effectively at 7, 20, and 30
   degrees C. Except for 85 mmol/L at the late stages during storage,
   NaCl-treated samples showed higher levels of total phenolics than
   control groups stored at 7, 20, and 30 degrees C. Additionally, samples
   treated with NaCl showed significantly delayed decrease of pH and total
   soluble solids especially at 20 and 30 degrees C. DPPH showed positive
   and significant correlation with total soluble solids, total phenolics,
   and total anthocyanins with r of 0.298 (p < .05), 0.376 (p < .01), and
   0.835 (p < .001), respectively, while no correlation with pH. Our
   results showed that NaCl has potential effect on maintaining the quality
   and extending shelf life of grape juice without preservatives. In
   addition, NaCl-treated grape juice could supplement water, electrolytes
   lost during exercise and antioxidant substances.
   Practical applications In this study, effects of NaCl on quality of
   grape juice during storage were investigated. NaCl effectively delayed
   decrease of anthocyanins and antioxidant activity and has potential
   effect on maintaining the quality grape juice. Additionally,
   NaCl-treated grape juice replenishes water, sodium, total soluble
   solids, antioxidant substances, etc., and provides a theoretical basis
   for the development of juice-type sports drinks.}},

Abstract = {{In order to enhance the robustness of image compression sensing system
   and reduce the mutual coherence between measurement matrix and sparse
   basis, this paper proposes an image measurement matrix optimization
   algorithm based on posterior information. Based on the traditional
   measurement matrix optimization model, the proposed algorithm considers
   the image reconstruction error from the OMP algorithm and uses it as a
   regular term. Matrix F-norm expansion and singular value decomposition
   are used to reduce the computational complexity and ensure the
   convergence of algorithm. Besides, the gradient matrix method is used to
   iteratively solve the measurement matrix. The proposed measurement
   matrix optimization model makes full use of the reconstruction error
   information of the image itself, not only improves the robustness of
   image compression sensing system, but also reduces the mutual coherence
   between the measurement matrix and the sparse basis. Experiments results
   show that compared with the state-of-the-art measurement matrix
   optimization algorithms, the proposed algorithm can reduce the average
   correlation coefficient more effectively, and the peak signal-to-noise
   ratio of the image can be increased by up to 1.2 dB.}},

Title = {{Molecular and biochemical rhythms in dihydroflavonol
   4-reductase-mediated regulation of leucoanthocyanidin biosynthesis in
   Carthamus tinctorius L}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{156}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Flavonoids are a distinctive class of phenolic compounds known to be
   involved in plant growth, development and floral pigmentation. During
   the natural phenylalanine pathway, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase is the
   first committed enzyme that catalyzes the stereo-specific reduction of
   dihydroflavonols into leucoanthocyanidins.Howsoever, less attention has
   been given to studies explaining the evolution and function of
   dihydroflavonol-4-reductases in Carthamus tinctorius L. This study
   explains the first comprehensive genome-wide identification and
   functional characterization of putative dihydroflavonol 4-reductase in
   Carthamus tinctorius L. Altogether, 20 CtCYP45082C enzyme encoding genes
   have been identified in the Carthamus tinctorius genome. Phylogeney
   analysis revealed the clustering of CtCYP45082C sequences into five
   major clades illustrating the significant effects of evolutionary
   divergence across the plant kingdom. Further in silico analyses
   indicated that all enzyme-encoding CtCYP45082Cs contain fundamental
   cis-regulatory units and protein domains/motifs that are specifically
   conserved throughout eukaryotic CYP450 s. In addition, the transient
   expression of CtCYP45082C1 fused with green fluorescent protein in onion
   epidermal cells and tobacco leaves confirmed a clearly distinct
   subcellular localization to plasma membrane. Biochemical
   characterization of CtCYP45082C1 using the heterologous protein
   expression assay indicated that CtCYP45082C1 effectively catalyzes the
   reduction of cis-3,4-leucopelargonidin and dihydromyricetin in
   leucoanthocyanidin biosynthesis. Moreover, the transcript expression of
   20 Carthamus tinctorius derived CYP45082C genes has also been analyzed
   by real-time quantitative PCR. Each mRNA transcript was detected, in
   general, in all the investigated tissues, but with different patterns
   except for CtCYP45082C17-20, indicating the potential role of
   CtCYP45082C gene family in the secondary metabolite biosynthesis of
   Carthamus tinctorius. Additionally, the expression of CtCYP45082C1 and
   two downstream flavonoid pathway regulatory genes following induction of
   methyl jasmonate, cold, H(2)0(2) and heat irradiation suggested that

Title = {{Thermochemical conversion of Polyalthia longifolia leaves at different
   temperatures and characterization of their products}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{280}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Lignocellulosic biomass is a renewable source of energy which can be
   harnessed to produce biofuels maintaining the carbon neutrality in the
   atmosphere. Thus, in this work, results of the pyrolysis of solid wastes
   of Polyalthia Longifolia (PL) leaves have been reported over a range of
   temperature from 450 degrees C to 600 degrees C at an interval of 50
   degrees C. All experiments have been carried out three times in order to
   ensure repeatability and/or reduce measuring uncertainties; and the
   average values along with their standard deviation values are presented.
   The pyrolytic products have been thoroughly characterized by several
   advanced characterization techniques such as FTIR, GCMS, NMR, XRD, SEM,
   TGA, etc. as applicable to different products in addition to their
   physical and fuel properties. Further, the physical and fuel properties
   are reported for both individual organic and aqueous phases after
   separating liquid pyrolysis product; as well as based on raw liquid
   product obtained by pyrolysis before separating into organic and aqueous
   phases. The average higher heating value of organic phase bio-oil is
   varying in the range 21.74-24.28 MJ/kg for different pyrolysis
   temperatures. The moisture content of organic phase biooil varies
   between 0.36 mass \% and 8.88 mass \% over the temperature range of this
   study. The pH of organic phase bio-oil is in the range of 5.80 to 6.04
   which indicate that the bio-oil is only marginally acidic; and further
   this range of pH is far better than their counterparts of open
   literature. From the GCMS analysis of bio-oil samples, it is found that
   phenol, 2,6-dimethoxy (syringol) is present with highest area \% of
   22.71 for the case of 600 degrees C pyrolysis temperature. Finally, the
   bio-oils produced from the pyrolysis of PL leaves are of good quality in
   terms of moderately large HHV, pH and low moisture content.}},

   nanosheet for energy harvesting applications - A density functional
   study}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{279}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The Li and Na decorated Si2BN are investigated as electrodes for energy
   applications. At first, Na and Li decorated Si2BN is used to adsorb H-2
   molecules and the obtained adsorption energy values are in the range
   of-0.278-0.506eVs which are ideal for Hydrogen storage in practical
   applications. The desorption temperatures of H-2 molecule on Li and Na
   decorated Si2BN are 449 K and 355 K respectively. As of now, this may be
   the first theoretical work where the Li and Na decorated Si2BN is used
   to adsorb CO2 molecule, and the adsorption energy values on Li and Na
   decorated Si2BN are-0.500 eV and-0.431 eV respectively. Due to the Li
   and Na decoration, the adsorption energy is more enhanced than three
   times of CO2 adsorption on Si2BN mono-layer. The quasi molecular
   interaction between the Li/Na and CO2 amplifies the bond distance
   between C and O, can induce catalyst reaction. The obtained results show
   that the Li and Na decorated Si2BN can also be used in CO2 capture and
   conversion technology such as Li-CO2 and Na-CO2 batteries. The
   desorption temperatures of CO2 on the Li and Na decorated Si2BN are 308
   K and 265 K respectively, and the calculated desorption temperatures are
   desirable for storage medium. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{RFLS - Resilient Fault-proof Localization System in IoT and Crowd-based
   Sensing Applications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{170}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of event localization in the
   presence of anomalous nodes, in Internet of Things (IoT) and Mobile
   Crowd Sensing (MCS) systems. A sensing node could be anomalous due to
   faultiness in any of its components, or due to maliciousness, where it
   may forge and inject false readings. In both cases, anomalous nodes can
   significantly alter the task quality and outcome, which may lead to
   catastrophic consequences, especially in sensitive applications. The
   current localization systems are not designed to account for the
   probability of having anomalous readings, hence subjecting them to high
   errors. Additionally, current anomaly detection systems are not well
   suited for localization tasks because they are neither dynamic nor
   continuous, and they do not account for the radial-spreading patterns of
   data in localization tasks. To overcome these challenges, a Resilient
   Fault-proof Localization System (RFLS) is proposed, which a) includes an
   anomaly detection process designed specifically for localization tasks
   using means of data-based clustering and centroiding, b) dynamically
   integrates greedy- and genetic-based active nodes selection,
   Bayesian-based data fusion, and anomaly detection processes in one full
   localization system, and c) assesses and updates the nodes' reputations
   to ensure better performance in future tasks. The efficacy of the
   proposed system is validated by running experiments for single and
   sequential localization tasks, for varying conditions, and by using a
   real-life dataset of the vehicular mobility traces in the city of
   Cologne, Germany. The results demonstrate that anomalous nodes are
   efficiently detected, eliminated, and penalized, which in turn greatly
   improves the accuracy of the localization tasks.}},

   glycine-rich loop motifs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR RECOGNITION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The conserved GxGxxG motif of protein kinases forms a beta turn at the
   tip of the flexible glycine-rich loop and creates much of the ATP pocket
   binding surface. Notable exceptions to this sequence include GGGxxG in
   ABL kinase and GxGxxA in protein kinase C isoforms. We constructed the
   corresponding mutants of PKA, T51G, and G55A, and tested quinazoline
   inhibitors that were designed to bind via glycine-rich loop
   interactions, testing also staurosporine for comparison. The quinazoline
   inhibitors have significantly reduced binding strengths in both mutants.
   In striking contrast to these results, the binding of the
   ``pan-kinome{''} inhibitor staurosporine is strengthened in the mutants.
   Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) shows that the tightened binding of
   staurosporine arises from increased k(on) rates, changes not offset by
   more moderately increased k(off) rates. The SPR results fit best to a
   two step binding process for staurosporine in wild type PKA, but not the
   mutants.}},

   atrazine under visible light}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{318}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The development of transition metal chalcogenide (TMC) colloidal
   photocatalysts has become crucial for applications in ecological
   remediation. Atrazine (AZ) is recognized as a potentially toxic
   herbicide used in many agricultural and food industries. In this paper,
   we introduce a facile solution route to prepare hexagonal CuS
   nanoparticles by a one-step sol-gel method. Then, these CuS
   nanoparticles are assembled on various amounts of graphene oxide
   nanosheets to produce colloidal CuS@rGO photocatalysts. Investigations
   of numerous structural, optical, and optoelectrical properties of CuS
   reveal the importance of adding rGO. Adding 7.0 wt\% rGO to CuS enhances
   light absorption and decreases the bandgap from 2.36 to 1.97 eV. In
   addition, the optimized CuS@rGO (at 7\% rGO) displays superior
   photooxidation of AZ (as a common pollutant) in just 20 min at a dose of
   only 0.8 gL(-1), with outstanding stability. The increased
   photocatalytic ability is ascribed to the improved surface properties of
   the obtained CuS and photogenerated carrier recombination suppression by
   introducing rGO. This study realizes the importance of applying
   rGO-supported TMCs for the elimination of herbicides in water. (C) 2020

   enhancement of high rate phage infection and productivity}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{163}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The development of cost-effective bioreactors and scalable methods for
   the high quantities of bacteriophage production meets the global demand
   for phage therapy. This study demonstrates the potential application of
   a novel PES-STiO2 nanocomposite membrane (NCM) to maintain the
   bacteriophages, increase the adsorption rate, and productivity in the
   phage enrichment reactor (PER). A constant volume of freshly grown
   Escherichia coll. cells in tryptic soy broth (TSB) medium (first phase)
   was tainted with Escherichia phage in PER (second phase) in a cyclic
   process. Subsequently, the bacteria-phage filtrate and phage lysate
   samples were removed from the PER through the external cross-flow
   membrane reactor and the outlet of the PER at each cycle, respectively.
   The PER performed with the membrane had shown higher phage titers and
   productivity in the phage lysate at each cycle than those achieved from
   the PER w/o NCM (control). The phage productivity was increased (similar
   to 10(7) to 10(13) PFU mL(-1) cycle(-1)) with the increase in cycles and
   was higher than those from the control, and other reported reactors. As
   detected with the electron scanning microscope (SEM) and flux test, the
   NCM operated with bacteria-phage could able to prevent biofouling
   without their loss. Thus, the PES-STiO2 nanocomposite membrane
   integrated PER is simple and can be used at an industrial scale to
   maintain the volumetric phage production and higher phage productivity.}},

   first-order linear equation with a period-two coefficient, and give
   several examples. In the last section we prove Ulam stability for a
   periodic coefficient function of arbitrary finite period. Results on the
   associated first-order perturbed linear equation with periodic
   coefficient are also included. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Tailoring of activated carbon with ammonia for enhanced anaesthetic
   sevoflurane adsorption}},
Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{251}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Activated carbon (AC) has been reported to be useful for removing waste
   volatile anaesthetics that are highly potent greenhouse gases. Surface
   functionalities play essential roles in sevoflurane adsorption. However,
   the relationship between surface nitrogen functionalities and
   sevoflurane adsorption has not been investigated. In this study, both
   single-and two-step nitrogenation of a granular AC were conducted to
   examine the effect of surface nitrogen functionality on sevoflurane
   adsorptivity under otherwise fixed experimental conditions (bed depth:
   10 cm, inlet concentration: 528 mg/L, and flow rate: 3 L/min). The
   potential interaction between sevoflurane molecules and surface nitrogen
   functionality were examined using the conductor-like screening model for
   real solvents (COMOS-RS). COSMO-RS prediction suggested that the
   nitrogen groups containing C-N-C structures had a higher tendency for
   sevoflurane to adsorb to activated carbon. The findings agreed with the
   experimental adsorption results, where the pyrrolic or pyridonic groups
   showed an enhancing effect on sevoflurane adsorption. These findings are
   a useful foundation for future tailoring of activated carbon adsorbents
   for selective enrichment of beneficial surface functionality to remove
   sevoflurane before emission of anaesthetic gases.}},

Abstract = {{Anaerobic degradation of enzymatically pretreated Chlorella vulgaris was
   aimed in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) to evaluate
   the organic loading rate (OLR) effect on biomass valorization. Low OLRs
   resulted in high methane yields (171 mL CH4/g CODin) at low hydraulic
   retention time (HRT of 6 days). Firmicutes (35-43\%), Bactemidetes
   (17-18\%) and Euryarchaeota (11\%) dominated at low OLRs, promoting
   methanogenic activity. On the contrary, the highest OLRs resulted in low
   methane yield (86 mL CH4/gCODin) with a concomitant short-chain fatty
   acids (SCFAs) accumulation of 37\% SCFAs-COD/CODin. The highest OLR
   decreased UASB reactor biodiversity, hampering Euryarchaeota population
   development (2.5\%) and boosting Firmicutes (55\%) and Proteobacteria
   (14\%). These results demonstrated the suitability of UASB reactor
   configuration to reach high bioprocess efficiency for both, biogas and
   SCFAs production, with lower energetic and area requirements than those
   normally needed in continuous stirred tank reactors.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: There isgrowing concern surrounding the harmful effects of
   soccer heading on cognitive function. The present study aims to examine
   the immediate effects of heading.
   Methods: 30 recreational male soccer players were divided into three
   groups that undertook 20 consecutive headers with a soft (8.8 psi), hard
   (16.2 psi), or no (control) ball. A battery of neuropsychological tests
   was completed before and after heading: King-Devick, trail-making (TM)
   (A, B), digit span (DS) and spatial span (SS) (forward, backward).
   Results: Significant increase in the time (M = 4.44 s) and errors (M =
   1.45) for the King-Devick test within the hard and soft groups, although
   there was no significant difference for TM-A and TM-B. Significant
   decline for SS forward within the hard and soft groups (M= -16\%),
   although the declines for SS backward (M = -16\%), DS forward (M= -23\%)
   and DS backward (M = -25\%) were present only for the hard group (ps
   <.05).
   Discussion: While outside of regular match-play, this study showed that
   heading negatively influenced one indicator of a suspected concussion
   (King-Devick), as well as working memory (DS, SS) that is essential for
   daily life. These findings contribute to the growing debate surrounding
   heading safety.}},

Abstract = {{The photo-electrochemistry of the hetero-junction Pt/CuCo2O4 synthesized
   by hydrothermal route was studied to assess its ability for the H-2
   formation under visible light illumination. The X-ray diffraction is
   characteristic of mixed phases with narrow lines of the spinel CuCo2O4
   and Pt. The sensitizer CuCo2O4 has a forbidden band (Eg) of 1.30 eV,
   well suited to the sun spectrum and displays p-type behavior. Its
   conduction band (-0.660 V-SCE), deduced from the capacitance - potential
   (C-2 - E) plot, is more cathodic than the H2O/H-2 level (-0.6 V-SCE),
   thus producing spontaneous H-2 evolution under irradiation. The
   photoelectrons are transferred to Pt clusters, to trigger the water
   reduction owing to the small H-2-over-potential. A quantum conversion
   yield of 0.65\% is obtained under visible light (total flux: 15 mW
   cm(-2), 3.42 x 10(18) photons s(-1)) with H-2 evolution rate of similar
   to 103 mu mol g(-1) min(-1), higher than that obtained over CuCo2O4 (73
   mu mol g(-1) min(-1)).}},

Title = {{Trisodium citrate assisted morphology controlled synthesis of nickel
   sulphide nanoparticles with enhanced cyclic stability as carbonaceous
   free electrode material}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{255}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Facile hydrothermal route is used for the synthesis of beta-NiS
   nano-particles under the influence of trisodium citrate and ammonia.
   Trisodium citrate anions act as shape modifier for controlling the
   growth of beta-NiS nanoparticles and ammonia acts as reducing
   agent,which eliminates the different phase of nickel sulphide such as,
   alpha-NiS, NiS2, Ni3S2, Ni7S6, etc. Rietveld refinement of the XRD data
   affirms the single phase formation of beta-NiS and its crystal structure
   is Rhombohedral. Morphology of p-NiS nanoparticles strongly depends upon
   the concentration of trisodium citrate. Pompon like structure was
   observed only when the molar ratio of nickel nitrate and trisodium
   citrate taken was 1:0.5. Increase in concentration of trisodium citrate
   results in formation of different morphologies which are observed in
   FESEM images. Growth mechanism of 3-D pompon like structure and its
   growth mechanism are discussed in detail. Morphology of the synthesized
   beta-NiS nanoparticles influences the electrochemical properties.
   Electrochemical properties had been studied using Cyclic Voltammetry
   (CV), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic stability.
   Carbonaceous material was not used during the fabrication of working
   electrode for electrochemical characterization. Pompon beta-NiS showed
   88\% capacitive retention over 1000 CV cycles with charge transfer
   (R-ct) resistance 4.32 Omega. Pompon like beta-NiS offers the extra
   conductive paths, increase electron transport rate, specific direction
   for electron carriers. It helps to provide easy path for electrolyte
   ions as well as large active surface area with more Faradaic sites which
   enhance the diffusion rate, during redox process. Textural properties
   were studied by FTIR and BET. BET analysis revealed that synthesized
   beta-NiS is mesoporous material. These results manifest that synthesized
   beta-NiS nanoparticles, are potential for electrode for electrochemical
   devices such as, lithium ions batteries, pseudocapacitors, etc.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{421}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Accurate calculation of electrostatic potential and gradient on the
   molecular surface is highly desirable for the continuum and hybrid
   modeling of large scale deformation of biomolecules in solvent. In this
   article a new numerical method is proposed to calculate these quantities
   on the dielectric interface from the numerical solutions of the
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Our method reconstructs a potential field
   locally in the least square sense on the polynomial basis enriched with
   Green's functions, the latter characterize the Coulomb potential induced
   by charges near the position of reconstruction. This enrichment
   resembles the decomposition of electrostatic potential into singular
   Coulomb component and the regular reaction field in the Generalized Born
   methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the enrichment recovery
   produces drastically more accurate and stable potential gradients on
   molecular surfaces compared to classical recovery techniques. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Three new substituted dicationic ionic liquids (DILs) based on
   biphenylenedimethylene linked bis-1-methylimidazolium ionic liquids
   {[}bis-(PhCH(2)Mlm)(+)], combined with three anions, namely dichloride
   {[}Cl](2), di (hexafluorophosphate) {[}PF6-](2) and
   di(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)Imide) {[}(CF3SO2)(2)N-](2) were
   synthesized. The three synthesized dicationic ionic liquids were
   characterized by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy in the region 4000-600 cm(-1) and
   4000-45 cm(-1), respectively. A complete vibrational assignments have
   been performed; the biphenylene linkage spacer is confirmed by the
   presence of strong Raman band at 1616 cm(-1) related to the C=C
   vibration in all our investigated DILs. Moreover, a conformational
   investigation of the cation was performed by means of DFT calculations
   using the 6 31G{*}{*} basis set and the B3LYP theory. The comparison of
   the computed and experimental Raman spectra further corroborate the
   structure of the cation. Finally, the thermal stability of the DILs was
   investigated by TGA and DTA measurements. The DILs with Cl-, PF6- and
   {[}(CF3SO2)(2)N-] anions decompose at 252, 323 and 420 degrees C,
   respectively. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Photovoltaic systems on dairy farms: Financial and renewable
   multi-objective optimization (FARMOO) analysis}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{278}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to develop a financial and renewable
   multi-objective optimization (FARMOO) method for dairy farms. Due to
   increased global milk production and European Union policies concerning
   renewable energy contributions, the optimization of dairy farms from
   financial and renewable standpoints is crucial. The FARMOO method found
   the optimal combination of dairy farm equipment and management
   practices, based on a trade-off parameter which quantified the relative
   importance of maximizing farm net profit and maximizing farm renewable
   contribution. A PV system model was developed and validated to assess
   the financial performance and renewable contribution of this technology
   in a dairy farming context. Seven PV system sizes were investigated,
   ranging from 2 kWp to 11 kWp. Multi-objective optimization using a
   Genetic Algorithm was implemented to find the optimal combination of
   equipment and management practices based on the aforementioned trade-off
   parameter. For a test case of a 195 cow spring calving dairy farm in
   Ireland, it was found that when the relative importance of farm net
   profit was high, a PV system was not included in the optimal farm
   configuration. When net profit and renewable contribution were of equal
   importance, the optimal farm configuration included an 11 kWp PV system
   with a scheduled water heating load at 10:00. Multi-objective
   optimization was carried out for the same test case with the goals of
   maximizing farm net profit and minimizing farm CO2 emissions. Under this
   scenario, the optimal farm configuration included an 11 kWp PV system
   when the relative importance of farm net profit was low. This study
   included a sensitivity analysis which investigated the use of a 40\%
   grant aid on PV system capital costs. This sensitivity analysis did not
   significantly improve the financial feasibility of PV systems on dairy
   farms. Moreover, it was found that load shifting of a farm's water
   heating enabled the majority of the PV system's electricity output to be
   consumed. Hence the use of batteries with small PV systems on dairy
   farms may not be necessary. The method described in this study will be
   used to inform policy and provide decision support relating to PV
   systems on dairy farms.}},

Abstract = {{TPS/MA/PLA is a blend of thermoplastic starch (TPS) and polylactic acid
   (PLA) compatibilized by maleic anhydride (MA) that can be a substitute
   for petro-based plastics in certain applications. At the end of its
   life, this material must be properly disposed in treatment systems such
   as composting or anaerobic digestion. The biodegradability of
   TPS/MA/PLA, PLA, TPS and the non-compatible mixture (TPS/PLA) was
   evaluated in a slurry thermophilic anaerobic digestion system (STAD)
   according to ISO 13975-2012 standard. The anaerobic inoculum was
   prepared from cow manure and the organic fraction of municipal solid
   waste. After 31 days of incubation, the pure PLA exhibited a 12-day lag
   phase and 40.41\% of biodegradability. TPS, TPS/PLA and TPS/MA/PLA did
   not exhibit lag phase and reached 92.11\%, 65.48\% and 64.82\% of
   biodegradation respectively. The slow degradation rate of PLA is
   attributed to its high glass transition temperature and crystallinity.
   In TPS/MA/PLA and TPS/PLA, about 50\% of PLA and 13\% to 10\% of the TPS
   remains undegraded and MA did not affect the biodegradation of
   TPS/MA/PLA compared to TPS/PLA. Results suggest that, in very short
   retention times STAD systems, PLA based materials could not exhibit
   enough biodegradability. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging with high angular resolution requires large apertures and long
   focal lengths. This has prevented the integration of telephoto lenses
   into thin devices such as modern mobile phones. We report a camera
   module employing multiple rotated rectangular apertures and folding of
   the optical system into the plane of the camera, enabling an
   order-of-magnitude reduction in depth compared to traditional telephoto
   lenses. Multiple images are fused in the frequency domain to yield a
   single high-resolution image equivalent to that yielded by a single
   circular aperture. The diameter of this equivalent aperture may be
   several times wider than the depth of the camera module. We propose two
   architectures and present illustrative optical designs to demonstrate
   the concept. Simulations of raytraced image acquisition and
   computational image reconstruction demonstrate the potential for
   high-quality, high-resolution imaging from thin, flat lens modules. (C)

Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{528}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Protein-rich microalgae are a potential alternative to fishmeal in
   aquaculture. In this context, this study evaluated the effects of fish
   meal (FM) replacement by Chlorella sp. meal (CM) on the growth
   performance, bio-chemical parameters, enzymatic activity and
   reproductive performance of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Six experimental
   diets were formulated to progressively replace FM. Up to 100\% of FM was
   replaced with CM content at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 g/kg diet. A total
   of 450 zebrafish were randomly divided into six groups, each group
   containing five replicates with 15 animals per replicate. After 60 days
   of feeding trials, animals fed 40 g/kg CM showed significantly better
   growth compared to animals fed diets with no CM. Likewise, animals fed
   50 g/kg of CM presented the lowest levels of total cholesterol, LDL and
   triglycerides. The inclusion of CM had no significant effects on
   enzymatic amylase and lipase activity, while significantly increasing
   alkaline phosphatase activity. The highest levels of Chlorella sp. meal
   in the diets (40 and 50 g/kg of CM) provided the highest egg production
   (P = .004), hatching rate (P = .004) and larval survival (P = .009) at 6
   days post-fertilization. The replacement of FM by CM generated an
   increase in the final weight, accompanied by an improvement in total
   cholesterol, LDL, triglyceride levels, in addition to improving the
   reproductive performance of zebrafish, proving to be an interesting
   alternative to FM in zebrafish juvenile diets.}},

Title = {{LncRNA PVT1 accelerates malignant phenotypes of bladder cancer cells by
   modulating miR-194-5p/BCLAF1 axis as a ceRNA}},

Abstract = {{Background: Numerous studies proved that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is
   involved in the progression of multifarious diseases, especially in some
   carcinomas. As a potential tumor biomarker, plasmacytoma variant
   translocation 1 gene (PVT1) is involved in the development and
   progression of multifarious cancers. Nevertheless, the intrinsic and
   concrete molecular mechanism of PVT1 in bladder cancer still remained
   unclear, which is also the dilemma faced in many non-coding RNA studies.
   Results: Our research revealed that PVT1 was significantly higher
   expression in bladder carcinoma specimens and cell lines. Further
   experiments indicated that knockdown or overexpression of PVT1
   restrained or promoted the malignant phenotype and WNT/beta-catenin
   signaling in bladder cancer cells. Meanwhile miR-194-5p was in contrast
   and miR-194-5p could partially reverse the function of PVT1 in malignant
   bladder tumor cells. As a microRNA sponge, PVT1 actively promotes the
   expression of b-cells lymphoma-2-associated transcription factor 1
   (BCLAF1) to sponge miR-194-5p and subsequently increases malignant
   phenotypes of bladder cancer cells. Therefore, it performs a
   carcinogenic effect and miR-194-5p as the opposite function, and serves
   as an antioncogene in the bladder carcinomas pathogenesis.
   Conclusion: PVT1-miR-194-5p-BCLAF1 axis is involved in the malignant
   progression and development of bladder carcinomas. Experiments revealed
   that PVT1 has a significant regulatory effect on bladder cancer (BC) and
   can be used as a clinical diagnostic marker and a therapeutic molecular
   marker for patients suffering from BC.
   Methods: In urothelial bladder carcinoma specimens and cell lines, the
   relative expression levels of PVT1 and miR-194-5p were detected by
   quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Through experiments
   such as loss-function and over-expression, the biological effects of
   PVT1 and miR-194-5p on the proliferation, migration, apoptosis and
   tumorigenicity were explored in bladder cancer cells.
   Co-immunoprecipitation, proteomics experiments, dual luciferase reporter
   gene analysis, western blot and other methods were adopted to
   investigate the PVT1 potential mechanism in bladder carcinomas.}},

Abstract = {{Porous single crystals would significantly enhance their catalysis
   functionalities owing to the combination of structural coherence and
   porous microstructures. Porous single crystals have wormhole
   microstructures and then we define them as wormcrystals. The twisted
   surfaces in porous microstructures would produce surface lattice
   distortions that give rise to high-energy active surfaces. Here we grow
   porous iron single crystals at an unprecedented 2 cm scale with a
   lattice reconstruction strategy and create high-energy surfaces through
   the control of lattice distortions within a thickness region of 1
   similar to 2 mff The porous iron crystal therefore boosts
   electrochemical reduction of nitrobenzene to aminobenzene with similar
   to 100\% conversion and > 95\% selectivity. The exceptionally high
   current densities with porous iron crystals represent the first level
   electrocatalysis performance. The current work would open a new pathway
   not only to the creation of high energy surfaces but also to the growth
   of porous single crystals at large scales in wealth of other materials.}},

Abstract = {{Heatproof domain-refined grain-oriented (DRGO) silicon steel is an ideal
   material for the manufacture of S15-type ultra-high efficiency
   transformer with three-dimensional wound-core (TDWC). In this paper, the
   microstructure, grain orientation, and magnetic performance of 23ZDMH80
   heatproof silicon steel during stress-relief annealing were investigated
   by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscattered
   diffraction (EBSD) techniques. Based on heatproof DRGO steel, the
   Epstein-SST (single sheet tester) conversion factor and equivalent
   magnetic path length were calculated, and then an ultra-high energy
   efficiency transformer was developed. Results show that, the average
   size of micrograins in notched region increased from 42.3 mu m to 68.2
   mu m after annealing at 850 degrees C for 0-8 h. The orientations of
   micrograins grown on large-size Goss grain included not only the non-<0
   0 1> orientations, such as \{210\} <- 241>, \{215\} <1-20>, and \{1 1
   0\} <1-12\}, which were harmful to the magnetic properties, but also the
   favorable \{1 0 0\} <0 0 1> and Goss. Correspondingly, the core loss of
   5 pairs of Epstein specimens first decreased then increased slowly (the
   growth rates below 1.2\%) during annealing. The Epstein-SST conversion
   factor delta P for 23ZDMH80 heatproof steel was 8.6\% (higher than 5.0\%
   the value recommended by IEC standard), and the equivalent magnetic path
   length was 0.489 m. Finally, the developed 10 kV/400 kVA transformer
   with TDWC presented ultra low no-load loss of 289 W, load loss of 3072
   W, and noise of 35.4 dB, it means significant advantage of energy
   conservation and environmental protection.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{25}},

Pages = {{375-384}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background The term `visually induced analgesia' describes a reduced
   pain perception induced by watching the painful body part as opposed to
   watching a neutral object. In chronic back pain patients, experimental
   pain, movement-induced pain and habitual pain can be reduced with visual
   feedback. Visual feedback can also enhance the effects of both massage
   treatment and manual therapy. The impact of somatosensory attentional
   processes remains unclear.
   Methods In the current study, participants received painful electrical
   stimuli to their thumb and back while being presented with either a
   real-time video of their thumb or back (factor feedback). In addition,
   using an oddball paradigm, they had to count the number of deviant
   stimuli, applied to either their back or thumb (factor attention) and
   rate the pain intensity.
   Results We found a significant main effect for attention with decreased
   pain ratings during attention. There was no main effect for visual
   feedback and no significant interaction between visual feedback and
   attention. Post-hoc tests revealed that the lowest pain intensity
   ratings were achieved during visual feedback of the back/ thumb and
   counting at the back/ thumb.
   Conclusion These data suggest that the modulation of perceived acute
   pain by visually induced analgesia may be influenced by a simultaneous
   somatosensory attention task.
   Significance Somatosensory attention reduced experimental pain intensity
   in the thumb and back in the presence of both congruent and incongruent
   visual feedback. We found no significant visual feedback effect on the
   complex interplay between visual feedback and somatosensory attention.}},

Journal = {{PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{193}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and
   Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission is characterizing the
   surface and orbital environment of the primitive asteroid (101955) Bennu
   to enable the collection and return of pristine samples of carbonaceous
   material. The Altimetry Working Group (AltWG) generates digital terrain
   models (DTMs) that are essential for assessing the sampleability and
   science value of potential sample sites. The AltWG uses
   stereophotoclinometry (SPC) to generate these DTMs from images collected
   by the OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite. We built and evaluated an SPC-derived
   DTM by performing a flight-like test, using images (0.4-3 cm per pixel)
   of a physical test wall constructed to simulate a 3 m x 3m portion of
   Bennu's surface. We built the DTM using images acquired under similar
   lighting conditions to those planned for the OSIRIS-REx mission and
   processed them using flight-like SPC procedures. The results were
   compared to measurements of the wall obtained using a laser altimeter.
   We found maximum height differences between the SPC-derived model and
   the altimetric data of -2.6 and 3.4 cm (or 13-17\% of the dynamic range
   of the heights across the wall), specifically around large surface
   rocks. For the majority of the SPC-derived model, differences are less
   than +/- 0.5 cm (<2.5\% of the dynamic range of the heights across the
   wall) or similar to 1.5 x the images' best pixel scale of 0.4 cm. In the
   spatial frequency domain, spectral correlation and coherency assessments
   comparing the SPC-derived model and the altimetric data show that the
   SPC-generated DTMs are an excellent product from wavelengths of similar
   to 3 m down to shorter wavelengths of similar to 0.1 m.
   Cross-correlation assessment of images rendered from the SPC-derived
   model vs. images of the test wall further show that our models
   accurately reproduce the combined albedo and surface shape, with
   cross-correlation scores >0.65.}},

Abstract = {{Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of pulmonary
   tuberculosis (TB), is responsible for millions of infections and deaths
   annually. Decades of TB vaccine development have focused on adaptive T
   cell immunity, whereas the importance of innate immune contributions
   toward vaccine efficacy has only recently been recognized. Airway
   macrophages (AwM) are the predominant host cell during early pulmonary
   M. tuberculosis infection and, therefore, represent attractive targets
   for vaccine-mediated immunity. We have demonstrated that respiratory
   mucosal immunization with a viral-vectored vaccine imprints AwM,
   conferring enhanced protection against heterologous bacterial challenge.
   However, it is unknown if innate immune memory also protects against M.
   tuberculosis. In this study, by using a murine model, we detail whether
   respiratory mucosal TB vaccination profoundly alters the airway innate
   immune landscape associated with AwM prior to M. tuberculosis exposure
   and whether such AwM play a critical role in host defense against M.
   tuberculosis infection. Our study reveals an important role of AwM in
   innate immune protection in early stages of M. tuberculosis infection in
   the lung.}},

Title = {{Stick-IT: A simplified model for rapid estimation of IDR and PFA for
   existing low-rise symmetric infilled RC building typologies}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{223}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The prediction of seismic performances of buildings in terms of
   engineering demand parameters EDP, such as interstorey drift ratios IDR
   and peak floor accelerations PFA, represents a fundamental step towards
   the assessment of potential direct economic losses.
   This paper proposes a simplified model for the rapid assessment of EDPs
   in infilled moment resisting frames subjected to seismic loadings
   suitable for large scale assessment studies. The proposed model, named
   Stick-I (Stick model for Infilled frames), is a mull-degree of freedom
   MDOF system consisting of a series of lumped masses connected by means
   of nonlinear shear link elements. The shear link behavior is suitably
   calibrated adopting a multi-objective Genetic Algorithm procedure that
   employs the results of nonlinear cyclic pushover analyses performed on
   refined nonlinear FEM. Based on the regression study performed on a
   suitably generated Stick-I model database, a more general Stick-IT
   model, representative of RC Infilled frame Typologies of assigned storey
   number and dimensions in plan, is introduced. Simplified formulas for
   the definition of Stick-IT model are proposed depending on low-level
   information data that can be easily retrieved from rapid on-site surveys
   or remote sensing techniques.
   Both Stick-I and Stick-IT models are validated comparing the results of
   NRHA performed on refined FEMs with the results obtained adopting the
   simplified models and good agreement in terms of maximum EDP values and
   distribution along the building height is obtained.
   The typological Stick-IT model, which is defined as a function of few
   geometric and mechanical parameters, can be easily applied for
   simplified evaluation of expected response for building typologies.
   Hence, it can also be usefully employed for assessment of direct losses
   at the large scale, with a significant reduction in computational burden
   with respect to more refined methods.}},

Title = {{Drivers of leaf area index variation in Brazilian Subtropical Atlantic
   Forests}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{476}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The Atlantic Forest, a global biodiversity hotspot, has changed
   dramatically due to land use pressures causing deforestation,
   degradation, and forest fragmentation. A major challenge is to
   understand and potentially mitigate the consequences of these changes,
   for the capacity of forests to deliver essential environmental services
   to rural areas. Here, we focus on unraveling the mechanisms underpinning
   spatial variation in forest leaf area index. Forest leaf area index can
   be used as an environmental indicator that controls key forest functions
   underlying environmental services and is also expected to respond to
   land use change. Specifically, we use Structural Equation Modelling to
   determine the direct and indirect pathways that link environmental
   drivers to canopy leaf area index (LAI) variation across forest types in
   the Atlantic Forest in Southern Brazil. We sampled 240 sample units
   (each 4000 m(2)), from a systematic and permanent forest inventory set
   which covers the State of Santa Catarina in a 10 km x 10 km grid, using
   hemispherical photographs. Environmental variables were extracted for
   each sample unit, including climatic and topographic data as well as
   indicators of anthropogenic pressure. Our results showed that forest
   types differed in their leaf area index (but not all of them) and that
   forest canopies show complex responses to environmental drivers,
   encompassing direct and indirect pathways. A major pathway was the
   positive effect of `Distance to city' on the `Percentage of cropland in
   the matrix'. This led to a decline in the distance of the sample unit to
   the forest edge, indirectly reducing LAI, presumably because of elevated
   tree mortality at the forest edge. `Terrain steepness' and `Rainfall in
   the driest month' independently affected the `Percentage of cropland in
   the matrix' and the `Distance to forest edge'. Halting forest
   fragmentation and increasing fragment size by landscape planning will
   mitigate these anthropogenic LAI declines. This can be achieved with a
   combination of legal and market mechanisms, like enforcement of the
   Brazilian Forest Act regulation on buffer zones around water bodies and
   steep slopes, landscape planning, and payment for environmental services
   to compensate the farmers for maintaining forest cover on otherwise
   productive land.}},

Title = {{Complete transverse stress recovery model for linear shell elements in
   arbitrarily curved laminates}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{252}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Out-of-plane failure is common in composite layered materials. Its
   detection in numerical simulations usually involves a high-level of
   spatial refinement which may lead to an excessive computational time for
   large struc-tures. This paper presents a formulation for the recovery of
   the transverse stresses in conventional linear shell elements based on
   First-Order Shear Deformation Theory. Starting from the equilibrium
   equations, the pro-posed formulation allows the calculations to be made
   for arbitrary curvatures including variable ones. Compared to the
   Extended-2D method, it has the advantage of including all the
   contributions from the force and moment derivatives making it reliable
   in complex load cases. Several examples with different laminates,
   curvatures and loads are presented. The numerical results confirm the
   potential of the proposed method to be used both as post-processing tool
   for conventional models and as an enrichment criterion for adaptive
   modelling.}},

Abstract = {{Predatory insects have reproductive organs rich in complex changes that
   may be responsible for the success of their population growth. The
   species Chrysoperla externa is a predator used in biological control
   programs in Latin America. However, there is no morphological data about
   the morphology of the reproductive tract in this insect. This study
   describes the morphology of the reproductive organs of virgin and mated
   C. externa male and female. The male has a pair of testes yellow in
   color and five pairs of accessory glands closely associated with the
   seminal vesicles. The testis follicles are twisted filled with cysts in
   different developmental stages. The pair of ovaries in the females shows
   asymmetry with 9-11 ovarioles per ovary with oocytes in different
   developmental stages and a spherical spermatheca. Virgin and mated males
   have no differences in the size of the testes, seminal vesicle, and
   accessory glands. C. externa females show morphological changes in the
   reproductive tract according to sexual maturation, which is triggered by
   mating. The ovary activation occurs after female mating. The ovaries are
   of merotistic polytrophic type. The spermathecal reservoir is lined by a
   flattened epithelium with a thin cuticular intima and associated with
   well-developed muscles. It is concluded that the reproductive tract of
   C. externa is similar in virgin and mated males and females. Egg
   production is activated only after mating and the development of
   reproductive tract structures is faster in mated females.}},

Title = {{Survival of thermotolerant coliforms in municipal biosolids after
   application in tropical soil cultivated with Eucalyptus}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{274}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The increasing production of biosolids in urban areas has been led to a
   search for alternative disposal avenues of this residue, which is rich
   in organic matter and nutrients. Agricultural land application of
   biosolids, motivated by its fertilizing power, is a widespread practice
   in many countries, but there are safety and regulatory concerns
   regarding the presence of pathogens in Class B biosolids. In addition,
   the scarcity of studies under tropical climate conditions raises
   questions that impede the agricultural use of this residue in some
   regions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of
   thermotolerant coliforms over 12 months (52 weeks) after biosolids
   application on the surface of a Quartzipsamment neosol cultivated with
   Eucalyptus. Two different biosolids were studied: those generated by a
   biological treatment system with complete mixing aeration ponds followed
   by decantation ponds (Treatment A) and biosolids from a biological
   treatment system with conventional activated biosolids reactors
   (Treatment B), both delineated in randomized blocks with four
   replicates. After application on the forest soil, we estimated an
   average survival time of 54 weeks for thermotolerant coliforms present
   in Treatment A biosolids and 93 weeks in Treatment B biosolids.
   Thermotolerant coliforms persist much longer under tropical climate
   conditions in Brazil than in comparable studies under temperate climate
   conditions. This reaffirms the need to carry out studies covering the
   full range of moisture and temperature regimes in which biosolids are
   applied as fertilizer.}},

   (90 days) of 10 - 20 nm uniformly dispersed in PVA-GG hydrogel was
   obtained. Simultaneously, at the optimum concentration of AgNO3 (0.01
   M), the tensile strength and elongation at break were enhanced by 74 \%
   and 11 \%, and swelling capacity was increased by 18 \% as compared to
   PVA-GG hydrogel (control). The PVA-GG-AgNPs hydrogel composite exhibited
   excellent catalytic activity and antibacterial property, which makes

Title = {{The depositional flux of meteoric cosmogenic Be-10 from modeling and
   observation}},
Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{550}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Meteoric cosmogenic Be-10 is a powerful tracer to quantify dates and
   rates of Earth surface processes over timescales of 10(3)-10(5) yrs. A
   prerequisite for its applications is knowledge of the flux at which
   Be-10, produced in the atmosphere, is delivered to the Earth surface.
   Four entirely independent approaches are available to quantify this
   flux: 1) General Circulation Models (GCM) combined with Be-10 production
   functions and aerosol dynamics; 2) Be-10 in precipitation collections;
   3) Be-10 inventories in dated soil profiles; 4) riverine Be-10 exported
   in solid and dissolved forms. We compiled and reprocessed published
   globally distributed Be-10 flux data from each of these methods and
   compared them with each other after normalization to a common
   atmospheric production rate. Based on precipitation records, we propose
   a simple framework to discriminate between two delivery effects on Be-10
   fluxes. In the additive effect water vapor and Be-10 are continuously
   accumulating during long-distance transport, leading to an increase in
   Be-10 flux with precipitation rate. In the dilution effect, the Be-10
   flux is delivered from proximal vapor sources, limited by the rate of
   Be-10 introduction from the stratosphere and independent of
   precipitation rate. Both effects are mostly present in combination, and
   the relative weight of either effect depends on vapor condensation rate
   and on the ratio of vapor condensation area to precipitation area. A
   comparison between precipitation-derived fluxes and GCM-derived fluxes
   shows that half of the precipitation estimates are >2 times greater than
   GCM-derived fluxes. By comparison, soil- and GCM-derived fluxes agree
   within a factor of 2 for more than half (similar to 57\%) of the
   dataset, and the remaining soil estimates (similar to 43\%) are much
   lower than GCM-derived fluxes. 71\% of Be-10 flux estimates from
   riverine export using Be-10 (meteoric)/Be-9 ratios also agree with
   GCM-derived fluxes within a factor of 2. We explain the
   precipitation-derived fluxes that commonly exceed all other estimates by
   short-term stochasticity in precipitation events that might introduce a
   measurement time-interval bias towards higher fluxes. This bias is not
   present over longer-term (10(3) -10(5) yrs) flux estimates like those
   from soil profiles. Soil-derived fluxes might still present an
   underestimation when retention of Be-10 in soil is incomplete. We
   recommend producing more Be-10 depositional flux data from soil
   inventories with full Be retention, as these generate in our view the
   most relevant estimates for applications of meteoric Be-10 on
   millennial-scale Earth surface processes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Purpose: Risk of multiple myeloma is increased in African American (AA)
   populations compared with European American (EA) cohorts. Current
   estimates of risk of progression of monoclonal gammopathy of
   undetermined significance (MGUS) are based largely on studies in EA
   cohorts. Prospective analyses of this risk in AA cohorts are lacking.
   Patients and Methods: Between 2003 and 2011, 331 eligible patients with
   IgG/A monoclonal gammopathy were enrolled in a prospective observational
   trial (SWOG S0120).
   Results: Of 331 eligible patients, 57 (17\%) were of AA descent. The
   risk of transformation to clinical malignancy in AA patients was
   significantly lower than in non-AA cohort (2-year risk 5\% vs. 15\%;
   5-year risk 13\% vs. 24\%; log-rank P = 0.047). Differences in risk were
   evident for both MGUS and asymptomatic multiple myeloma. Gene expression
   profile (GEP) of CD138-purified plasma cells revealed that all molecular
   multiple myeloma subsets can be identified in both cohorts. However, the
   proportion of patients with high-risk GEP risk score (GEP-70 gene risk >
   -0.26) was lower in the AA cohort (0\% vs. 33\%, P = 0.01). AA cohorts
   also have higher levels of antibodies against Epstein-Barr nuclear
   antigen-1 (EBNA-1; P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: These data provide the first prospective evidence that
   multiple myeloma precursor states in AA patients may have lower risk of
   disease compared with non-AA counterparts with lower incidence of
   high-risk GEP and increased EBV seropositivity. Race-dependent
   differences in biology and clinical risk of gammopathy may impact
   optimal management of these patients.}},

Title = {{Monitoring ungauged watersheds for investigating the variability of flow
   and salinity to implement the possible removal of salt fill sites}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{192}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Salinity is a crucial environmental problem leading to profound
   consequences in wetland plants and aquatic habitats including the rapid
   development of Phragmites australis in the marshland. These Phragmites
   australis are extremely vulnerable to capture fire, which might
   eventually affect the overall ecosystem of the marsh. However, in order
   to restore the marsh, a hydrologic investigation is needed, which is
   possible if a watershed is gauged, and long-term data are available. In
   this study, a systematic approach has been presented to conduct
   hydrologic modeling and salinity prediction in an ungauged watershed in
   order to implement the possible removal of salt fill sites. The stage
   and electrical conductivity were measured continuously, whereas stream
   cross sections and velocity of the streamflow were recorded
   intermittently in the Blackbrook Creek to develop a rating curve and
   generate continuous streamflow data. The watershed model Soil and Water
   Assessment Tool (SWAT) was calibrated and validated to a monthly scale
   with good model performance. In the next step, critical sources of
   salinity were identified from the two tributaries in order to implement
   the removal of salt fill sites for the possible reduction of salinity in
   the marsh. While salinity loading was approximately 10 times higher from
   Marsh Creek (65.63 tons to 2028.13 tons per month) compared with
   Blackbrook Creek (10.23 tons to 163.98 per month), the analysis
   suggested that salinity concentration was higher from Blackbrook Creek,
   which was particularly due to abandoned salt fill sites near the Creek.
   The salinity loadings were linearly correlated with streamflow on a
   monthly (R-2 = 0.81) scale, which was utilized to generate the salinity
   loadings that were diverted due to the rerouting of the Creek through
   the new location in order to avoid salt fill sites and reduce salinity
   in the Mentor Marsh. Our analysis suggested that approximately 74 kg/day
   salinity was being rerouted from the Marsh; however, the salt fill sites
   contribute salinity to the Marsh equivalent to 63 kg/day, which still
   needs to be removed. The research findings are expected to be helpful
   for monitoring small ungauged watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Fistula formation is a severe adverse event related to antiangiogenetic
   agents such as bevacizumab and inferior mesenteric arteriovenous fistula
   (IMAVF) is a result of acquired factor, especially colon surgery.
   However, IMAVF occurs very rarely and there are few reports in patients
   during chemotherapy. We report a case of a patient who developed IMAVF
   during treatment with bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
   after colon surgery.
   CASE SUMMARY
   An 81-year-old man was diagnosed with descending colon cancer and
   underwent left hemicolectomy without any complications. He was
   definitely diagnosed with high-risk stage 2 and received tegafur-uracil
   plus leucovorin as adjuvant chemotherapy. Three years and 6 mo after the
   operation, the cancer relapsed with peritoneal dissemination. The
   patient underwent CyberKnife radiosurgery targeting the recurrent tumor
   and received chemotherapy with S-1 plus bevacizumab. At 1 year after
   chemotherapy, he complained of severe diarrhea, which is suspected
   drug-induced colitis. As diarrhea worsened despite the termination of
   treatment, he underwent colonoscopy and computed tomography (CT) scans
   that revealed edematous change from sigmoid to rectosigmoid colon. CT
   scans also revealed an aneurysm adjacent to the inferior mesenteric vein
   and multidetector CT angiography showed the IMAVF. Elective angiography
   confirmed the diagnosis of an IMAVF and it was successfully treated by
   arterial embolization. The patient resumed chemotherapy with only S-1 6
   mo after embolization.
   CONCLUSION
   Clinicians should keep in mind the probability of severe diarrhea arose
   from IMAVF in mCRC patients treated with bevacizumab.}},

Abstract = {{COVID-19 has challenged social workers to engage with health pandemics
   and provide essential services in conditions of uncertainty and high
   risk. They have safeguarded children, older adults and diverse adults in

   technologies, adhered to government injunctions, maintained social and
   physical distancing under lockdown and worked from home remotely. Social
   workers and social care workers have risen to the challenges, providing
   services with inadequate personal protective equipment and limited
   supervision and support. This article highlights the degraded physical
   environments, socio-economic and political contexts that intensify
   precariousness and constraints that neoliberalism imposed on
   professional capacity before and during this health pandemic. It
   provides guidelines to protect practitioners and service users. It
   concludes that practitioners ought to understand zoonotic diseases,

Abstract = {{The ability of many proteins to fold into well-defined structures has
   been traditionally considered a prerequisite for fulfilling their
   functions. Protein folding is also regarded as a valuable loophole to
   escape uncontrolled and harmful aggregations. Here we show that the
   PBX-regulating protein-1 (PREP1), an important homeodomain transcription
   factor involved in cell growth and differentiation during embryogenesis,
   is endowed with an uncommon thermostability. Indeed, circular dichroism
   analyses indicate that it retains most of its secondary structure at
   very high temperatures. These findings have important implications for
   PREP1 functions since it is a stabilizing factor of its partner PBX1.
   Predictive analyses suggest that the observed PREP1 thermostability
   could be related to the presence of aggregation-prone regions.
   Interestingly, synthetic peptides corresponding to these regions exhibit
   a remarkable propensity to form toxic beta-rich amyloid-like aggregates
   in physiological conditions. On this basis, we suggest that PREP1
   stability is an effective way to prevent or limit the formation of
   harmful aggregates. Notably, one of these PREP1 fragments (residues
   117-132) is able to reversibly switch from alpha-helical to beta-rich
   states depending on the environmental conditions. The chameleon
   conformational behavior of this peptide makes it an ideal system to
   study this intriguing and widespread structural transition. (C) 2020

Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},

Abstract = {{Microcystis aeruginosa bloom in aquatic ecosystems is a worldwide
   problem that threaten aquatic animals. Fish are an unavoidable link
   between toxic cyanobacteria and human health. A stable microbiota is an
   important barrier for fish in defence against pathogen invasion.
   Therefore, in this study, we investigated the microbiota characteristics
   in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract and faeces of
   Lateolabrax maculatus that were cultured in a pond with a naturally
   occurring M. aeruginosa bloom. Compared with those of the healthy fish,
   the cyanobacterial bloom decreased the serum immune indexes of the
   diseased fish, such as the immunoglobulin M content and lysozyme
   activity. Microbiome analysis showed that the M. aeruginosa bloom did
   not change the microbial richness and diversity of the diseased fish but
   significantly altered the community composition. Specifically, M.
   aeruginosa bloom increased the abundance of Proteobacteria but decreased
   the abundance of Firmicutes; some genera of pathogenic bacteria
   (Acinetobacter, Mycobacterium and Staphylococcus) were abundant, while
   some beneficial bacteria (Weissella and Lactococcus) were reduced. Our
   results reveal that M. aeruginosa bloom significantly impair the
   immunity and gastrointestinal microbiota composition of L. maculatus and
   that microbiota variation may be a factor causing almost all fishes
   exhibit unhealthy or diseased characteristics. These results will be
   helpful for the utilization of microbiome characteristics to facilitate
   healthy fish farming in cyanobacterial bloom environments.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, it has been demonstrated that the Hexatic vortex fluid
   realized in 2-dimensional vortex state of a very weakly pinned amorphous
   MoGe thin film is extremely sensitive to external ac excitation. A large
   amplification of resistance is observed when the sample is exposed to
   external electromagnetic radiation or a small ac current is superimposed
   with the subcritical measuring dc current. The observed resistance
   strongly depends on both amplitude and frequency of the ac excitation.
   In this paper, we develop an inertial model of vortex lattice subjected
   to a small amplitude of ac current, by extending the flux creep theory.
   We show that the resistance increases exponentially with both amplitude
   and frequency of the ac current and explain quantitatively the variation
   of resistance with the amplitude and frequency of ac current using the
   presented model.}},

Title = {{Obliquity dependence of the formation of the martian polar layered
   deposits}},
Journal = {{PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{193}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Mars' polar layered deposits (PLD) are comprised of layers of varying
   dust-to-water ice volume mixing ratios (VMR) that are thought to record
   astronomically-forced climatic variation over Mars' recent orbital
   history. Retracing the formation history of these layers by quantifying
   the sensitivity of deposition rates of polar material to astronomical
   forcing is critical for the interpretation of this record. Using a Mars
   global climate model (GCM), we investigate the sensitivity of annual
   polar water ice and dust surface deposition to a variety of obliquity
   and surface water ice source configurations at zero eccentricity that
   provide a reasonable characterization of the evolution of the PLD during
   recent low-eccentricity epochs. The GCM employs a fully interactive dust
   lifting/transport scheme and accounts for the coupling effects of the
   physics of dust and water on the transport and deposition of water ice
   and dust. Under a range of tested obliquities (15 degrees-35 degrees),
   the predicted net annual accumulation rates range from -1 mm/yr to +14
   mm/yr for water ice and from +0.003 to +0.3 mm/yr for dust. GCM-derived
   accumulation rates are ingested into an integration model that simulates
   polar accumulation of water ice and dust over five consecutive obliquity
   cycles (similar to 700 thousand years) during a low eccentricity epoch.
   A subset of integration model simulations predict combined north polar
   water and dust accumulation rates that correspond to the
   observationally-inferred average growth rate of the north PLD (0.5
   mm/yr). These integration model simulation results are characterized by
   net water transfer from the south to the north polar region. In the
   north, a similar to 230 m-thick deposit is accumulated over similar to
   700 thousand years. Three types of layers are produced per obliquity
   cycle: a similar to 30 m-thick dust-rich (20-30\% dust VMR) layer that
   forms at high, a similar to 0.5 m-thick dust lag deposit (pure dust)
   that forms at low obliquity, and two similar to 10 m-thick dust-poor
   (similar to 3\%) layers that separate the dust rich layers and form when
   obliquity is increasing or decreasing. The similar to 30 m-thick
   dust-rich layer is reminiscent of a similar to 30 m scale length feature
   derived from analysis of visible imagery of north PLD vertical
   structure, while the similar to 0.5 mthick dust lag is only a factor of
   similar to 2 smaller than observed ``thin layers{''}. Overall, this
   investigation provides further evidence for an obliquity forcing in the
   PLD climate record, and demonstrates the importance of ice-ondust
   nucleation in polar depositional processes.}},

Title = {{Treatment of acidic wastewater via fluoride ions removal by SiO2
   particles followed by phosphate ions recovery using flow-electrode
   capacitive deionization}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{400}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A new process for the treatment of phosphoric acid industry wastewater
   is proposed. The technique comprises the following major steps: (1)
   selective removal of fluoride ions via reaction/adsorption with
   SiO2-containing particles; (2) microfiltration; and (3) flow electrode
   capacitive deionization (FCDI) for selective separation of phosphate
   ions. Three different silica-based materials were tested (quartz send,
   glass beads and fly ash) and F removal from initial concentration of 4.1
   gr/l to undetectable level was achieved using fly ash \& quartz sand
   mixtures (FA-QS). Fluoride adsorption by FA-QS resulted in pH reduction
   to pH =1.0, at which the phosphate system in the wastewater shifts
   towards the H3PO4 form as a dominating species. These uncharged species
   could be efficiently separated from Cl- and SO42- ions electrochemically
   using a single-electrode FCDI process. FCDI operated with a single
   electrode (5 \%wt activated charcoal powder) at a constant voltage of
   1.2 V resulted in 90\% selective separation of phosphorous with the
   complete removal of sulfate and chloride ions. The results, therefore,
   indicated that the new process can be effectively used to minimize the
   risk posed by the wastewater, while enabling the recovery of valuable
   phosphorus.}},

   heterojunction for improved photocatalytic H-2 generation}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Building a heterojunction composite which contains two or more
   semiconductors with matching energy band structures is an effective way
   to boost the photocatalytic performance. In this paper, a perfectly
   matching heterojunction constructed by semiconductors with a
   continuously changing energy band structure was demonstrated. It was
   found that migration of indium in layered ZnIn2S4 could be driven from
   the bulk to the surface under alkaline condition. Based on this,
   In(OH)(3) was in situ grown on the surface of ZnIn2S4, and meanwhile,
   ZnIn2S4 was converted to ZnmIn2S3+m with m continuously variable. Due to
   the concentration gradient of indium, the conduction band (CB) of
   ZnmIn2S3+m/In(OH)(3), which was formed by In5s5p orbitals mixed with
   Zn4s4p orbitals, displays a continuous change that can efficiently
   promote photogenerated charge separation and transfer.}},

   synthesis of Zanthoxylum bungeanum seeds}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{156}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Zanthoxylum bungeanum is an important commercial crop of the Rutaceae
   family, its peel is used as a condiment and also in traditional Chinese
   medicine. Seeds are rich in fatty acids but are usually rejected. To
   investigate the feasibility of using Z. bungeanum seeds to make
   biodiesel, techniques including GC-MS, transcriptome sequencing and
   RT-qPCR were used to analyse the fatty acids content and gene expression
   levels in seeds of five developmental stages. The results show that nine
   fatty acids are produced and that these accumulate during seed
   development, to reach the highest levels at maturity. At maturity, the
   levels of elaidic acid and palmitic acid are highest, each accounting
   for 22 \% of the total. These are followed by linoleic acid, linolenic
   acid, oleic acid and palmitoleic acid, which account for 18, 15, 7 and
   12 \% of the total, respectively. The contents of saturated and
   unsaturated fatty acids continued to accumulate during seed development.
   At maturity, the content of saturated fatty acids was 46.48 mg/g and the
   content of unsaturated fatty acids was 142.05 mg/g. Using transcriptome
   sequencing, the expression levels of 20 genes related to fatty-acid
   synthesis were determined. A fatty acids synthesis pathway model was
   established based on gene function annotation information. The results
   of intergroup correlation analysis and RDA analysis show that ENR, ECR
   and SAD1 play active roles in fatty acids synthesis in Z. bungeanum and
   were identified as key genes for fatty acids synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, photovoltaic (PV) technology has reached a high level of
   maturity in terms of module efficiency and cost competitiveness in
   comparison with other energy technologies. As PV has achieved high
   levels of deployment, the development of devices that can help to reduce
   PV operation and maintenance costs has become a priority. Soiling can be
   cause of significant losses in certain PV plants and its detection has
   become essential to ensure a correct mitigation. For this reason,
   accurate and low-cost monitoring devices are needed. While soiling
   stations have been traditionally employed to measure the impact of
   soiling, their high cost and maintenance have led to the development of
   innovative low-cost optical sensors, such as the device presented in
   this work and named ``DUSST{''} (Detector Unit for Soiling Spectral
   Transmittance). The thermal characterization of DUSST's components and
   the methodology used to predict soiling transmittance losses are
   presented in this study. The results show that the losses can be
   predicted with an error lower than 1.4\%. The method has been verified
   with an experimental campaign with naturally soiled coupons exposed
   outdoors in Jae ` n, Spain.}},

   treatments included formulations based on three different plant protein
   sources (soybean meal, canola meal, and sunflower meal) and one
   reference diet, each set differentiated by supplementation or no

   nutrients were identified in the diet containing soybean meal. The
   reference diet without phytase resulted in increased intestinal villus
   height, and the diet containing canola meal without phytase resulted in
   thicker intestine muscular layers. The proximate compositions between
   diets with and without phytase showed significant differences (p <
   0.05); the different protein sources responded in different ways to the
   activity of phytase. The diet with soybean meal showed the highest
   nutrient digestibility, and phytase supplementation improved the
   availability of dietary calcium and magnesium. The inclusion of
   sunflower meal (30\%) caused harmful changes in the intestinal villi of

Title = {{Thin film solar cells based on Ag-substituted CuSbS2 absorber}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{400}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{CuSbS2 has been considered as a promising photovoltaic absorber
   material, due to its earth abundant and environmentally friendly
   constituents. However, the electron affinity and similar radius of
   cations bring heavy atomic disorders in CuSbS2 film, limiting its
   photovoltaic performance. Herein, we report an efficient way to reduce
   disorders by introducing Ag atom into CuSbS2 crystal structure. The
   crystal structure and chemical analysis confirm that Ag occupies the Cu
   position in the as-prepared films by the spray pyrolysis. The absorption
   spectra combined with photoluminescence measurement indicate that
   Ag-substituted CuSbS2 films have fewer recombination centers. The
   density functional theory calculation result reveals that Ag-substituted
   CuSbS2 has a more stable crystal structure, and the formation energy of
   the primary point defects obviously increases. Therefore, Ag-substituted
   CuSbS2 photovoltaic device shows asignificantly improved power
   conversion efficiency from 0.73\% to 2.48\%.}},

Abstract = {{Let k be an infinite field and I subset of k{[}x(1), ..., x(n)] be a

   a set of generators of I. One can see that in the set I boolean AND
   k{[}x(1), ..., x(q+1)] there exist non-zero polynomials, depending only
   on these q + 1 variables. We aim to bound the minimal degree of the
   polynomials of this type, and of a Bezout (i.e. membership) relation
   expressing such a polynomial as a combination of the f(i). In particular
   we show that if deg f(i) = d(i) where d(1) >= d(2)... >= d(s), then
   there exist a non-zero polynomial phi(x) is an element of k{[}x(1), ...,
   x(q+1)] boolean AND I, such that deg phi <= d(s) Pi(n-q-1)(i=1) d(i). We

Journal = {{FOOD CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{330}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{With the increasing concerns on food safety, foodborne toxicants,
   particularly advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have drawn large
   attention ascribing to their central role in the pathogenic process of
   diabetic complications. In this study, the antiglycative ability and
   action mechanism of 10 dried flowers were measured in
   fructose/glucose-BSA model with apple flower as the most effective one,
   probably through trapping reactive carbonyl species. Furthermore, apple
   flower was added in cookies to evaluate its antiglycative effect and
   data suggested that the fortification of cookies with apple flower
   powders significantly inhibited the formation of methylglyoxal and
   fluorescent AGEs. Moreover, sensory evaluation data showed that 2.5\%
   (w/w) apple flower-fortified cookies had the highest acceptance. The
   active component in apple flower was further identified as phlorizin by
   chromatographic analysis. Our results highlighted the health benefits of
   consuming apple flower fortified foods which might possibly be developed
   into functional foods especially for diabetic patients.}},

   effectiveness against exoelectrogenic bacteria}},
Journal = {{BIOSENSORS \& BIOELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{168}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A sufficiently fast and simple antimicrobial susceptibility testing
   (AST) is urgently required to guide effective antibiotic usages and to
   surveil the antimicrobial resistance rate. Here, we establish a rapid,
   quantitative, and high-throughput phenotypic AST by measuring electrons
   transferred from the interiors of microbial cells to external
   electrodes. Because the transferred electrons are based on microbial
   metabolic activities and are inversely proportional to the concentration
   of potential antibiotics, the changes in electrical outputs can be
   readily used as a transducing signal to efficiently monitor bacterial
   growth and antibiotic susceptibility. The sensing is performed by
   directly measuring the total energy, or all the accumulated microbial
   electricity, generated by microbial fuel cells (MFCs) arranged in a
   large-capacity disposable, paper-based testbed. A common Gram-negative
   pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa wild-type PAO1 and
   first-line antibiotic gentamicin (GEN) are used in our experiments. The
   minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values generated from our
   technique are validated by the gold standard broth microdilution (BMD).
   Our new approach provides quantitative, actionable MIC results within
   just 5 h because it measures electricity produced by bacterial
   metabolism instead of the days needed for growth-observation methods.
   Moreover, as the equipment needed is simple, common, and inexpensive,
   our test has immense potential to be adopted in the field or
   resource-limited hospitals and labs to provide insightful assessments
   for research and clinical practices.}},

Abstract = {{Application of highly absorptive construction materials is proved to be
   one of leading causes of urban overheating in big cities. To avoid the
   excessive heat by the conventional construction materials, several
   advanced heat-rejecting coating technologies were developed during the
   last decades. The main idea behind heat-rejecting coatings is to have
   colder coatings with the same appearance and colour of conventional
   coatings. One of the existing technologies for heat-rejecting coatings
   are advanced coatings with high solar reflection in the infrared range
   or so-called cool coatings. Recently, re-emission of the visible-range
   light by nano-scale semiconductors, known as Quantum Dots (QDs), were
   introduced as another effective heat-rejecting technology. In this
   paper, we showed that QDs also demonstrate a very high solar
   transmission in the near-infrared range, and therefore, highly
   near-infrared reflective base layer can significantly improve their
   cooling potential. The high transmission value in the near-infrared
   range is due to the low absorption coefficient in the wavelengths longer
   than absorption edge wavelength (i.e. the wavelength corresponding to
   the bandgap energy) in semiconductors. We show that surface temperature
   reduction potential of CdSe/ZnS QDs film through fluorescent cooling is
   about 2.5 degrees C, which could be increased by another 8.1 degrees C
   with a highly near-infrared reflective base layer in a typical sunny
   day.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging serious
   global health problem. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in COVID-19
   patients, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA has
   been detected in stool specimens. However, the relationship between the
   gut microbiome and disease remains to be established.
   Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 30 patients with COVID-
   19, 24 patients with influenza A(H1N1), and 30 matched healthy controls
   (HCs) to identify differences in the gut microbiota by 16S ribosomal RNA
   gene V3-V4 region sequencing.
   Results. Compared with HCs, COVID-19 patients had significantly reduced
   bacterial diversity; a significantly higher relative abundance of
   opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus, Rothia, Veillonella, and
   Actinomyces; and a lower relative abundance of beneficial symbionts.
   Five biomarkers showed high accuracy for distinguishing COVID-19
   patients from HCs with an area under the curve (AUC) up to 0.89.
   Patients with H1N1 displayed lower diversity and different overall
   microbial composition compared with COVID-19 patients. Seven biomarkers
   were selected to distinguish the 2 cohorts (AUC = 0.94).
   Conclusions. The gut microbial signature of patients with COVID-19 was
   different from that of H1N1 patients and HCs. Our study suggests the
   potential value of the gut microbiota as a diagnostic biomarker and
   therapeutic target for COVID-19, but further validation is needed.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents experimental investigations on the flexural behavior
   of double-layer toughened sandwich glass with trilateral simple support.
   A total of sixty-four pieces of toughened sandwich glass with different
   thickness of single layer, supporting width, and loading length were
   subjected to out-of-plane flexural loading tests. It was demonstrated
   that the specimens failed with all pieces of cracks combined together as
   an entire unit rather than to separate into a large number of glass
   fragments. The cracks appeared only at the lower layer of toughened
   sandwich glass and the upper layer of the toughened sandwich glass was
   integral and undamaged. The ultimate capacity and flexural rigidity of
   the toughened sandwich glass are enhanced with increasing the thickness
   of single layer, supporting width, and loading length. Among all studied
   parameters, the thickness of single layer exerts the largest influence
   on the ultimate capacity and flexural rigidity of toughened sandwich
   glass, while the effect of supporting width is quite limited. A
   simplified design formula was put forward to predict the ultimate
   capacity of double-layer toughened sandwich glass with trilateral simple
   support under out of-plane flexural loading, which was verified to be
   reasonable and accurate.}},

Abstract = {{In the European project AQUO, underwater radiated noise from the
   chemical tanker M/T Olympus was thoroughly investigated by measurements
   in full-scale as well as in model-scale. To investigate the
   repeatability of measurement and the sensitivity to loading condition
   variations, a new set of model-scale measurement was performed in 2019.
   The 2019 measurements have slightly lower cavitation volume than the
   2013 measurements, but the difference is within normal variability
   considering water quality, propeller painting, pitch setting accuracy
   and set-up of the model. At the design speed, tip vortex cavitation
   dominates the noise with a hump around 70 Hz in full-scale. The tip
   vortex is under-predicted by the model-scale tests and the agreement
   with sea-trial data between 30 Hz and 100 Hz is not satisfactory. At the
   reduced velocity conditions, leading-edge vortex cavitation dominates
   the noise with a hump around 150 Hz in full-scale. This type of
   cavitation and noise seems to be better predicted by the model-scale
   tests, thus the agreement with the sea-trial data is good. The improved
   hydrophone positions gave better signal to noise ratio while the
   application of transfer function measurements gave better estimates in
   the frequency range around 100 Hz.}},

Title = {{Restorations of fresh surfaces for topological materials by de-capping
   Te}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{530}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The topological categorization originates from a depiction of the
   sequencing of bands around the band gap of the material in comparison to
   the normal vacuum type band ordering. The structure can either be normal
   or inverted, and thus topologically trivial or non-trivial. An odd
   number of Dirac fermions on the surface occurs in this type of material.
   Time-reversal symmetry is responsible to preserve the surface bands. On
   the other hand, topological crystalline insulator is protected by mirror
   symmetry; this system has an even number of Dirac surface state per BZ.
   Capping layer of Te or Se is necessary due to the high sensitivity of
   films surfaces to atmospheric pressure. The capping layer works as a
   protection from oxidation. In Bi2Te3 samples, the bonds between Bi and
   Te are covalent bonds while the bonds between Te-Te at a certain
   position are van der Waals bonds. Thereby, the bonds between amorphous
   Te cap and sample surface is weaker than van der Waals bonds within the
   sample structure. However, the top boost cleaving method was successful.
   But, for Pb1-xSnxTe samples the top boost cleaving method unsuccessfully
   results. The bonds between the metallic Pb1-xSnxTe sample surface and
   amorphous Te cap are stronger than van der Waals bonds in BaF2
   substrate, i.e. F-F van der Waals bonds. In this paper, we present
   different techniques to recover fresh surfaces, from classical methods
   (such as sputtering and annealing) working for all types of films and
   top boost methods, which could be less used due to the strong bonds in
   some films. Moreover, we were able to recover the immaculate surfaces
   for non-capped samples. We present here in a systematic study by low
   energy electron diffraction (LEED), x-ray photoemission spectroscopy
   (XPS), and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{255}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A novel dandelion-like CoP microspheres are prepared on carbon cloth via
   a hydrothermal method combined with a subsequent phosphatization
   treatment. The as-obtained CoP display a specific discharge capacity of
   409.1 C/g at 1 A/g, which retains 78.0\% after 1000 cycles at 5A/g.
   Moreover, Ni elements can be easily incorporated to form CoP/NiP
   hybrids, which not only boosts the specific discharge capacity to 872.6
   C/g, similar to 2.1 times higher than that of bare CoP, but also
   demonstrates excellent cycle stability (retaining 83.9\%@5A/g after 1000
   cycles). The enhanced performance is benefited from their unique
   structure with surface decorations and high utilization of active
   materials. In addition, the work function difference promotes charge
   transfer at interfaces which enhances their electrochemical performance.
   The above results demonstrate that the dandelion-like CoP/NiP hybrids
   are promising electrode materials for high energy storage.}},

   production in the NCP region, China}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{241}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Ozone has become a major atmospheric pollutant in the North Central
   Plain (NCP) of China. Comprehensive measurements concerning the vertical
   profiles and photochemical formation mechanisms of typical O-3 pollution
   episode during August 8-13, 2018 were conducted in the NCP. A maximum
   hourly ozone concentration of 346 mu g/m(3) was observed on Aug 10, in
   which the surface O-3 photochemistry was under a strong VOC-limited
   regime, and the ratio of VOC to NOx ranged from 4:1 to 4:3, with
   ethylene, toluene, xylene, and propene providing large contributions to
   O-3 chemical production. The vertical measurements of O-3, NOx, and the
   planetary boundary layer (PBL) height suggested that there were three
   different layers of photochemical O-3 production from the surface to 1.1
   km. The first layer was from the surface to 200 m, with high NO
   concentrations leading to a strong conversion between O-3 and NO2. The
   surface O-3 concentration was significantly lower than at 220 m during
   nighttime and early morning, with an average O-3 of approximately 60 mu
   g/m(3) and the maximum vertical gradient appearing in the early morning.
   Diurnal variations of NO2 and NO2 were significantly inversely
   correlated with O-3 and O-3. In the second vertical layer between 200 m
   and 1000 m the value of d {[}O-3]/dt ranged from 10 to 40 mu g/m(3)/h,
   and the maximum chemical production of O-3 occurred at 300 m. The third
   layer was located outside the PBL height, where O-3 precursors with
   short chemical lifetimes rapidly decreased, producing weak chemical
   O(3)production.}},

Title = {{Climate transition in the Asia inland at 0.8-0.6 Ma related to

Journal = {{QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{248}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Knowing the evolution history of the climate systems in the Asian inland
   dominated by either the Westerlies or the Asian monsoon, and
   understanding their associated driving mechanisms are crucial for
   assessing future trends of climate and environmental conditions in this
   region, but both the evolution and mechanisms are still under debate. In
   this study, we present a comparative analysis of massive data from an
   accurately dated drill core retrieved from the Westerlies controlled
   western Qaidam Basin (QB), with records from the Chinese Loess Plateau
   (CLP) dominated by the East Asia summer monsoon (EASM), to track the
   time and frequency domain evolution patterns and dynamic changes of the
   QB and the CLP systems. The results infer two main conclusions. First, a
   critical transition in the evolution of Qaidam paleolake occurred at
   0.8-0.6 Ma, characterized by striking changes in proxy variations and a
   system shift from periodic variations to more irregular fluctuations
   after 0.6 Ma. Second, a similar evolution pattern prevailed in the
   Qaidam paleolake region and in the EASM-dominated CLP between similar to
   2.7 and similar to 1.2 Ma, but a divergence of both systems started at
   similar to 1.2 Ma and fully established after 0.6 Ma, when largely
   fluctuating climate conditions in the QB with a distinct drying trend
   was accompanied by synchronous largely fluctuated EASM with an
   increasing trend after 0.6 Ma. We suggest that ice sheet expansion in
   the Northern Hemisphere, promoted by co-occurrence of low obliquity
   amplitudes and low eccentricity, drove both systems across a threshold
   at similar to 1.2 Ma, and the internal forcing due to glaciation
   disturbed the previous response of both systems to solar insolation and
   led to the divergence of two systems. At similar to 0.9-0.8 Ma, a node
   of the 1.2-Myr obliquity cycle co-occurred with an eccentricity minimum,
   which together with coeval decrease in atmospheric CO2 concentration,
   could have facilitated a striking expansion of ice sheets. The resulting
   more equatorial and zonally oriented northern hemisphere westerly jet
   could serve as key factor leading to the final collapse of Qaidam
   paleolake after similar to 0.6 Ma, and the divergence of the QB and the
   CLP systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A zwitterionic phosphoryldiserine (PDS)- chitosan conjugate was
   synthesized via Atherton-Todd reaction, and its degree of substitution
   of PDS and structure were characterized by H-1 and P-31 NMR spectra,
   ICP, FTIR and XRD. Thermal analysis confirmed that there existed the
   freezing bound water surrounding PDS-chitosan due to the introduction of
   zwitterionic PDS groups onto chitosan backbone. In vitro cytotoxicity
   and hemolysis assay demonstrated that PDS-chitosan had excellent cell
   compatibility. UV adsorption and fluorescence spectra revealed that the
   model protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA) tended to keep its native
   conformation and showed better thermal stability in aqueous media in the
   presence of PDS-chitosan. We also found that the esterase-like activity
   of BSA could be enhanced by low concentration of PDS-chitosan (C-BSA =
   0.33 mg/ mL, CPDS-chitosan = 0.0625 and 0.125 mg/mL, pH = 7.4, T = 25
   degrees C). The results indicated that zwitterionic PDS-chitosan showed
   great potential for maintaining protein function in biomedical
   applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Sex-specific plasticity across generations II: Grandpaternal effects are
   lineage specific and sex specific}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2800-2812}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) occurs when the environment
   encountered by one generation (F0) alters the phenotypes of one or more
   future generations (e.g. F1 and F2). Sex selective TGP, via specific
   lineages or to only male or female descendants, has been underexplored
   in natural systems, and may be adaptive if it allows past generations to
   fine-tune the phenotypes of future generations in response to
   sex-specific life-history strategies.
   We sought to understand if exposing males to predation risk can
   influence grandoffspring via sperm in three-spined stickleback
   Gasterosteus aculeatus. We specifically tested the hypothesis that
   grandparental effects are transmitted in a sex-specific way down the
   male lineage, from paternal grandfathers to F2 males.
   We reared F1 offspring of unexposed and predator-exposed F0 males under
   `control' conditions and used them to generate F2s with control
   grandfathers, a predator-exposed maternal grandfather (i.e.
   predator-exposed F0 males to F1 daughters to F2s), a predator-exposed
   paternal grandfather (i.e. predator-exposed F0 males to F1 sons to F2s)
   or two predator-exposed grandfathers. We then assayed male and female
   F2s for a variety of traits related to antipredator defence.
   We found little evidence that transgenerational effects were mediated to
   only male descendants via the paternal lineage. Instead, grandpaternal
   effects depended on lineage and were mediated largely across sexes, from
   F1 males to F2 females and from F1 females to F2 males. When their
   paternal grandfather was exposed to predation risk, female F2s were
   heavier and showed a reduced change in behaviour in response to a
   simulated predator attack relative to grandoffspring of control,
   unexposed grandparents. In contrast, male F2s showed reduced
   antipredator behaviour when their maternal grandfather was exposed to
   predation risk. However, these patterns were only evident when one
   grandfather, but not both grandfathers, was exposed to predation risk,
   suggesting the potential for non-additive interactions across lineages.
   If sex-specific and lineage effects are common, then grandparental
   effects are likely underestimated in the literature. These results draw
   attention to the importance of sex-selective inheritance of
   environmental effects and raise new questions about the proximate and
   ultimate causes of selective transmission across generations.}},

Abstract = {{A flexible and polarizable force field to describe acetonitrile in its
   three states of matter has been developed on the basis of an ab initio

   six mobile charges. Three thousands structures have been employed for
   the fitting including monomers, dimers and (rimers. Gas phase behavior
   has been tested by analyzing aggregates from dimers to 27-mer which give
   accurate reproducibility of the experimental and quantum-mechanical
   results. Classical MD simulations have been performed for the liquid and
   its crystalline alpha- and beta-forms. An analysis of liquid in a wide
   range of structural, dynamic, energetics and spectroscopic properties
   has been performed, as well as neutron diffraction data. Comparison with
   experimental information is satisfactory. Due to the first principles
   nature and the polarizable character of this force field properties of

Abstract = {{The study investigated the concentration of metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb,
   and Zn) and S in urban dust samples of Cancun, Quintana Roo, Mexico.
   This is the first study about urban dust pollution in Cancun. Urban dust
   samples were collected and divided in three groups: high traffic
   densities (HT), low traffic densities (LT), and fixed sources (FS). A
   statistical analysis was performed using Pearson correlation, Principal
   Component Analysis, and k-means clustering, in order to classify the
   data according to each sampling site. The behaviour of the corresponding
   concentration distributions is shown in cartographic data using
   Geographic Information Systems. Results from highest to lowest
   concentration, are as follows: S > Zn > Pb > Cu > Cr > Ni > Cd.
   Concentrations were compared with NOM-147-SEMARNAT/SSA1-2004, USEPA
   guidelines, and atmospheric fallout in topsoil estimated by 100 years of
   accumulation. Almost all results meet the norm
   NOM-147-SEMARNAT/SSA1-2004 limit, and USEPA guideline, except Cr (two
   sites) and Pb (three sites). However, results at all sites are higher
   than the atmospheric fallout limit. The geo-accumulation index (I-geo)
   class presents the order: Pb > Cu > Cd > Zn > S>Cr > Ni. The research
   revealed that urban dust from sites with heavy traffic had the highest
   S, Zn and Pb concentrations, while sites considered as low traffic and
   fixed sources showed significantly high levels of S, Cr and Pb. The
   results indicate two major sources contributing to metals and sulfur in
   road dust: (1) traffic and emissions from vehicles, and (2) vehicular
   parts. Finally, the results reported in this work could be useful to the
   authorities in order to select priority sites to install emissions
   monitoring systems.}},

Abstract = {{D-Limonene, a cyclized monoterpene, possesses citrus-like olfactory
   property and multi-physiological functions, which can be used as a
   bioactive compound and flavor to improve the overall quality of
   alcoholic beverages. In our previous study, we established an orthogonal
   pathway of D-limonene synthesis by introducing neryl diphosphate
   synthase 1 (tNDPS1) and D-limonene synthase (tLS) in Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae. To further increase D-limonene formation, the metabolic flux
   of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway was enhanced by overexpressing the key
   genes tHMGR1, ERG12, IDI1, and IDI1(WWW), respectively, or
   co-overexpressing. The results showed that strengthening the MVA pathway
   significantly improved D-limonene production, while the best strain
   yielded 62.31 mg/L D-limonene by co-expressing tHMGR1, ERG12, and
   IDI1(WWW) genes in alcoholic beverages. Furthermore, we also studied the
   effect of enhancing the MVA pathway on the growth and fermentation of
   engineered yeasts during alcoholic beverage fermentation. Besides, to
   further resolve the problem of yeast growth inhibition, we separately
   investigated transporter proteins of the high-yielding D-limonene yeasts
   and the parental strain under the stress of different D-limonene
   concentration, suggesting that the transporters of Aus1p, Pdr18p, Pdr5p,
   Pdr3p, Pdr11p, Pdr15p, Tpo1p, and Ste6p might play a more critical role
   in alleviating cytotoxicity and improving the tolerance to D-limonene.
   Finally, we verified the functions of three transporter proteins,
   finding that the transporter of Aus1p failed to transport D-limonene,
   and the others (Pdr5p and Pdr15p) could improve the tolerance of yeast
   to D-limonene. This study provided a valuable platform for other
   monoterpenes' biosynthesis in yeast during alcoholic beverage
   fermentation.}},

   vertices i and j of L-n (resp. R-n). One may see that
   \{L-n\}(n=1)(infinity) and \{R-n\}(n=1)(infinity) are two nontrivial
   families with diameter going to infinity for which all resistance
   distances have been explicitly calculated. We determine the maximum and
   the minimum resistance distances in L-n (resp. R-n). The monotonicity
   and some asymptotic properties of resistance distances in L-n and R-n
   are given. As well we give formulae for the Kirchhoff indices of L-n and
   R-n respectively. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental and modeling investigation on
   thermally-driven subcritical and transcritical ejector refrigeration
   systems using refrigerant R32 as the working fluid. The performances of
   the ejector and its corresponding refrigeration system are studied under
   different ejector primary flow inlet temperatures, primary flow inlet
   pressures, and ejector outlet pressures. A theoretical model of the
   ejector is established and validated by experimental data. The results
   show that the physical properties of the working fluid significantly
   affect the performance of such ejectors. The mass flow rate of the
   primary flow exhibits a nonlinear change when the ejector inlet pressure
   or temperature is near the pseudo-critical state. At high primary flow
   inlet temperatures and pressures, the mass flow rate of the secondary
   flow of the transcritical ejector no longer increases with increasing
   primary flow inlet parameters, showing characteristics like the
   subcritical ejector. The optimal primary flow inlet pressure of the
   ejector refrigeration system increases with increasing primary flow
   inlet temperature, but remains unchanged after reaching about 7.1 MPa.
   The transcritical ejector refrigeration system exhibits a higher
   coefficient of performance than its subcritical counterpart at most
   primary flow inlet temperatures. The transcritical ejector has a better
   pressure lift performance, while the subcritical ejector exhibits a
   higher entrainment ratio only at low pressure lift ratios. Moreover, the
   transcritical system exhibits a unique oscillation phenomenon under some
   conditions, with the oscillation amplitudes in both the mass flow rates
   reaching up to 60\% of their averages.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new approach for Automatic Algorithm
   Selection. In this new procedure, we feed the predictor of the best

   machine learning model should consider and learn from the Anytime
   Behavior of the solvers, together with features characterizing each
   instance. For this purpose, we propose a general Framework and apply it
   to the Knapsack problem. Thus, we created a large and diverse dataset of
   15, 000 instances, recorded the anytime behavior of 8 solvers on them
   and trained and tested three machine learning strategies, collecting the
   results for different machine learning algorithms. Our results show
   that, for the majority of the tuples <instance, time>, the solver that
   computes the best objective value can be predicted. We also make this
   data publicly available, as a challenge for the community to work in
   this problem and propose new and better machine learning models and

Title = {{Reliability and validity of the multiple sclerosis resiliency scale

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{418}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the internal
   reliability and construct validity of the Multiple Sclerosis Resiliency
   Scale (MSRS) in comparison with a common measure of global resilience.
   Methods: Participants were 216 community-dwelling adults with MS (mean
   age: 48.8 +/- 12.5 years; 77\% female; median disease duration: 8 years)
   recruited through a university-affiliated MS Center. Participants
   completed the MSRS, 10-item Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CDRS),
   Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and depressive and anxious symptom items
   from the SymptoMScreen.
   Results: The MSRS exhibited fair to excellent internal consistency
   (alpha s 0.74 to 0.91) and divergent validity with disability severity
   (r = -0.19), MS duration (r = 0.07), and MS subtype (r = -0.01). The
   MSRS total and Emotional and Cognitive Strategies subscale scores were
   moderately correlated with the CDRS (rs = 0.50 and 0.62), PSS (rs =
   -0.56 and - 0.62), depressive symptoms (rs = -0.49 and - 0.54), and
   anxious symptoms (rs = -0.38 and - 0.047). The MSRS total and Emotional
   and Cognitive Strategies subscale scores exhibited fair to good accuracy
   (AUCs = 0.73 to 0.83) for identifying participants in the highest and
   lowest CDRS quartiles; however, cutoff scores yielded only fair
   sensitivity and specificity, and the measures differed significantly in
   classification of participants into highest and lowest quartiles.
   Conclusion: Although the MSRS may be useful in assessing resilience to
   MS-specific challenges, use of a global resilience measure may still be
   indicated depending on the clinical and research context.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that English speakers produce fewer pronouns when
   discourse contexts include more than one entity that matches the gender
   of the pronoun, i.e., gender effect. It is controversial, however, what
   causes the gender effect. Some suggest that it results from speakers'
   avoidance of linguistic ambiguity, while others suggest that it results
   from the influence of non-linguistic conceptual similarity between
   discourse entities. To adjudicate between the two accounts, the present
   study investigates how Mandarin speakers choose referring expressions in
   written and spoken Mandarin. As written and spoken Mandarin differ in
   their referential ambiguity (the third-person singular pronoun is
   gender-ambiguous in spoken Mandarin but not in written Mandarin), it
   provides a good testing ground for evaluating the two accounts with the
   manipulation of gender similarity. We found that Mandarin speakers'
   pronoun use was affected by pronoun ambiguity but not by conceptual
   similarity of discourse entities. In particular, in written Mandarin,
   where pronouns are gender-specific, Mandarin speakers produced fewer
   pronouns when there was more than one character that matched the gender
   of the pronoun. In spoken Mandarin where pronouns are gender-ambiguous,
   however, Mandarin speakers' pronoun use was not influenced by gender of
   discourse characters. Our findings suggest that the gender effect is
   driven by an ambiguity-avoidance strategy rather than conceptual
   similarity between discourse characters.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are frequent
   complications among acute patients hospitalized in neurological units,
   especially among those hospitalized for stroke. This study aimed to
   investigate if enhanced hygienic measures, including the systematic use
   of personal protective equipment (PPE), determined a decrease in HAI
   during the recent COVID-19 outbreak in ``COVID-free{''} neurological
   units.
   Methods: Patients hospitalized in neurology and stroke units of
   Policlinico Umberto I Hospital in Rome from March 8, 2020 and discharged
   prior to May 31, 2020 were included in the study and compared with
   patients hospitalized during the same period in 2019.
   Results: A total of 319 patients were included in the study (n = 103 in
   2020, n = 216 in 2019). Among patients hospitalized in 2019, the
   incidence of HAIs was 31.5\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.25-0.38),
   compared with 23.3\% (95\% CI: 0.15-0.32) in 2020 (p = 0.12).
   Multivariable logistic regression showed that hospitalization during
   2020 was independently associated with a lower risk of HAIs (odds ratio:
   0.34, 95\% CI:0.16-0.71, p = 0.004). Poisson regression models showed
   that hospitalization during 2020 was also independently associated with
   both a lower number of HAIs (relative risk {[}RR]: 0.56, 95\%
   CI:0.38-0.81, p = 0.01) and a lower number of prescribed antibiotics per
   patient (RR: 0.66, 95\% CI: 0.49-0.87, p = 0.02).
   Conclusion: Our study design provides evidence regarding the impact of
   stricter hygienic measures, such as increased PPE use, on HAIs. Larger
   studies are needed to support the extension of preventive measures even
   after the COVID-19 outbreak in order to limit the occurrence of HAIs.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{318}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A novel magnetic deep eutectic solvent (DES)-based polymeric hydrogel
   was synthesized via a facile and rapid (in 4 min) thermal frontal
   polymerization, using acrylic acid-menthol DES (as a functional
   monomer), ammonium persulfate (as initiator), and acrylic acid-Fe3O4
   nanoparticles (as cross-linker). The hydrogel was characterized by FTIR
   and FE-SEM techniques and utilized as a sorbent in magnetic solid-phase
   microextraction coupled with GC-mu ECD for the determination of 16
   pesticides. Significant parameters such as sorbent dosage, desorption
   conditions, adsorption time, pH, and ionic strength were investigated
   and optimized. The validation results showed that this polymer could act
   as an excellent sorbent for pesticides. The LODs were in the range of
   0.002-0.120 mu g L-1, and the linear range was between 0.003 and 20 mu g
   L-1. The enrichment factors were obtained from 152 to 550. The intra-day
   (n = 6) and inter-day (n = 4) RSDs were in the ranges of 0.8-6.8\% and
   2.4-17.3\%, respectively. The performance and extraction efficiency of
   DES hydrogel were compared with those of DES functional monomer.
   Finally, the optimized method was applied for the determination of

Abstract = {{Ginseng is a perennial herb used as valuable traditional medicine for
   more than three thousand years. Ginsenosides are the major group of
   pharmacologically active components of ginseng, and they are effective
   against various diseases. Present study was designed to investigate the
   impact of foliar silicon sprays on growth characteristics, physiological
   traits, and pharmaceutical quality of 6-year-old ginseng plants. Three
   different concentrations i.e. 50 mg/L, 100 mg/L, and 200 mg/L of Si was
   used as foliar treatment. Compared to control, stem hardness was
   enhanced up to 54\% in 100 mg/L treatment followed by 38\% in 50 mg/L
   and 36\% in 200 mg/L. SEM analysis showed that the density of epidermal
   cells was 21-25\% higher in Si-treated plants than that in the control
   plants. Cuticle thickness was found higher in Si treated plants as
   compared to control. Overall a total of 25\%, 38\%, and 54\% of cuticle
   thickness and 43\%, 49\%, and 63\% ginseng roots production was observed
   in plants treated with Si treatment of 50 mg/L, 100 mg/L, and 200 mg/L,
   respectively. Results suggest that out of three different concentrations
   of Si treatments, 200 mg/L found to be most effective in overall higher
   Si content in leaves with thick cuticle and higher root production, 100
   mg/L treatment showed high photosynthesis rate followed by stomatal
   conductance, chlorophyll content and stem hardness. 50 mg/L was found to
   be least effective. Out of 12 ginsenosides analyzed in 6-year-old
   ginseng roots, the most common were AP, Rg1, Rb1, and Re. The content of
   ginsenosides per gram of ginseng roots did not show any significant
   differences among treatments, but overall, ginsenosides contents were
   higher in Si-treated plants because of increased root growth triggered
   by increased Si level. Our study show that the application of aerial
   sprays with elevated Si levels increases the growth, promotes the
   physiological and morphological traits and increases the yield of
   6-year-old ginseng plants. In addition, this study implied the
   importance of Si for commercial production of high-quality ginseng
   roots.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous carbons have been
   extensively investigated as their large surface area and facile ion
   transport can provide high-performance in energy applications. Here we
   report new hierarchically porous carbon materials based on a polymer of

   from nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) and subsequent
   carbonization. The intrinsic micropores of PIM-EA-TB and meso-and
   macro-pores formed via the NIPS process imbue the resulting carbon
   material with a hierarchical porous architecture with an exceptionally
   high surface area of 1966 m(2) g(-1) and a high electrical conductivity
   of 83.6 S cm(-1). This well-organized structure provides pathways for
   efficient charge transportation, giving it a high specific capacitance

   puffer (Takifugu rubripes) under two different culture systems}},
Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{528}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Tiger puffer (Takifugu rubripes) is one of the most commercially
   important fish species cultivated and consumed in East Asian countries,
   including Japan, South Korea and China. In this study, the hepatic
   glycolysis, and lipogenesis, and serum biochemistry of tiger puffers
   subjected to short-term culture in offshore sea cage aquaculture system
   (OSCS) and recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) were evaluated.
   Results showed that the activity of hepatic phosphofructokinase, and
   lipoprotein lipase, ATP level, and serum cortisol content of the male
   tiger puffers reared in OSCS were significantly higher than those of
   female tiger puffers reared in OSCS and those of fish reared in RAS. The
   lowest hepatic fatty acid synthetase activity, lipid droplet number,
   serum aspartate aminotransferase activity, Na+ and Cl- concentrations
   were observed in male tiger puffers reared in OSCS. However, serum
   glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, K+ concentrations and alanine
   aminotransferase activity of tiger puffers reared in RAS and OSCS showed
   no significant differences. Hepatic glycolysis and lipogenesis were
   profoundly affected by rearing system and gender. The interaction effect
   of gender and rearing system on hepatic lipoprotein lipase activity,
   lipid droplet number and serum Na+ level was observed. These results
   indicate male tiger puffers exhibited different metabolic status in
   hepatic glycolysis, lipogenesis, and serum biochemical parameters when
   reared under two different culture systems. These findings will provide
   important information for improving tiger puffer (Takifugu rubripes)
   farming and profitable production using the RAS and OSCS aquaculture
   systems in the north coast of China.}},

Title = {{Long term variability of carbonaceous aerosols over Southeast Asia via
   reanalysis: Association with changes in vegetation cover and biomass
   burning}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{245}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we examine the seasonal variability and long-term trends
   in aerosol distribution over peninsular Southeast Asia (SEA: 90
   degrees-105 degrees E, 15 degrees-28 degrees N) based on MERRA-2
   reanalysis datasets for a period of 30 years (1985-2015). Special
   emphasis has been given on the loading and distribution of carbonaceous
   aerosols, in response to changes in vegetation cover and biomass burning
   over SEA. MERRA-2 reanalysis reveals a distinct seasonality in columnar
   AOD distribution, that peaks (0.3-0.45) in the pre-monsoon (March-May)
   season, with a maximum contribution from carbonaceous aerosols (similar
   to 60\%). The ratio of organic carbon (OC) to black carbon (BC) column
   mass density indicates a dominant contribution from biomass burning
   along with biogenic emissions (OC/BC > 10), while the OC (BC) aerosols
   during pre-monsoon vertically vary between similar to 6 and 12 mu gm(-3)
   (similar to 0.6-1.6 mu gm(-3)) in the lower troposphere (surface to 700
   hPa) during pre-monsoon. Interestingly, linear regression in monthly
   variability of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) over SEA shows a
   slightly increasing tendency during the recent decade (2004-2015), while
   the number of fire counts decreased during the same time period. In
   addition, a slightly positive trend in OC-AOD is likely associated with
   the increase in vegetation cover that contributes to the rising trend of
   biogenic OC emissions, while the reduction in biomass burning is linked
   with the declining trend of BC-AOD. The pre-monsoon average shortwave
   flux at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) obtained from MERRA-2 over SEA
   varies from -12 to -6 Wm(-2) and presents a decreasing tendency during
   the last 30 years due to a decrease in absorbing BC fraction. The
   temperature anomalies are well related to changes in BC-AOD, and OC-AOD
   at 850 hPa level, revealing important atmospheric heating.}},

Abstract = {{Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are multifunctional enzymes that play
   major roles in a wide range of biological processes, including cellular
   detoxification, biosynthesis, metabolism, and transport. The dynamic
   structural scaffold and diverse functional roles of GSTs make them
   important for enzyme engineering and for exploring novel
   biotechnological applications. The present study reported a significant
   gain-of-function activity in GST caused by a point mutation at the
   conserved F136 residue. The fluorescence quenching and kinetic data
   suggested that both binding affinity and catalytic efficiency of the
   mutant enzyme to the substrates 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), as
   well as the glutathione (GSH), is increased. Molecular docking showed
   that the mutation improves the binding interactions of the GSH with
   several binding-site residues. The simulation of molecular dynamics
   revealed that the mutant enzyme gained increased structural rigidity
   than the wild-type enzyme. The mutation also altered the residue
   interaction network (RIN) of the GSH-binding residues. These phenomena
   suggested that mutations led to conformational alterations and dominant
   differential motions in the enzyme that lead to increased rigidity and
   modifications in RIN. Collectively, engineering GST with a single point
   mutation at conserved F136 can significantly increase its xenobiotic
   activity by increasing the catalytic efficiency that may be exploited
   for biotechnological applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In leather industry, it is a big challenge to deal with tons of waste
   leathers, especially those containing chromium. On the other hand,
   non-precious cost-effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
   electrocatalysts are of considerable demands for
   environmentally-friendly energy production. Herein, in order to meet
   these two challenges, we creatively utilized chromium-containing waste
   leathers to fabricate high performance nonprecious HER catalysts.
   Leather consists of collagen bundles; high temperature annealing of
   Cr-containing waste leather results in the formation of (Cr, N)-co-doped
   carbon cloth (CNCC). Molybdenum carbide nanoparticles can be
   simultaneously coupled onto CNCC (Mo2C@CNCC) by loading Mo oxyanions on
   waste leather through wet impregnation before annealing. The resulted
   Mo2C@CNCC is self-supported and can be directly applied as HER
   electrode, which exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic HER performances
   in alkaline media with low overpotential (113 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)) and
   long-term stability (more than 70 h). The existence of Cr in waste
   leather is unbeneficial for waste leather disposition, but plays an
   important role to enhance the HER performances. This simple ``changing
   harm for the treasure{''} mute provides a new green concept for dealing
   with waste leather and creating high performance electrocatalysts.}},

Title = {{Sedimentary rhythm of Mn-carbonate laminae induced by East Asian summer
   monsoon variability and human activity in Lake Ohnuma, southwest
   Hokkaido, northern Japan}},
Journal = {{QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{248}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Past and ongoing precipitations of Mn-carbonate (rhodochrosite) have
   occurred in the freshwater Lake Ohnuma, which is situated about 8 km
   south of the Hokkaido-Komagatake volcano, southwest Hokkaido (northern
   Japan). Lake sediments from a surface and a longer similar to 4 m core
   contain the sedimentary rhythms of rhodochrosite laminae and volcanic
   deposits which were identified by nondestructive micro-XRF fluorescence
   analyses. The three tephra ash layers from the Hokkaido-Komagatake
   volcano, characterized by peaks of Al, Si, K, Ca, and Ti, correspond to
   regionally recognized tephras (1640, 1929 and 1996 CE) based on ashfall
   isopachs and Cs-137, Pb-210 and C-14 ages determined from the two cores.
   The sedimentation rate showed a drastic change around 1929 CE; similar
   to 0.3 cm/yr for 1640-1929 CE and similar to 2.7 cm/yr for 1929-2012 CE.
   The Mn content record of Lake Ohnuma sediments, composed of
   rhodochrosite laminae, showed a periodic variation with a
   decadal-centennial scale over the interval 1640-2012 CE. Sediment
   petrography and hydrochemical measurements suggest that the metastable
   phase of rhodochrosite was deposited during summer after being
   precipitated, followed by the crystal growth of rhodochrosite within the
   anoxic sediments. On the basis of these results, high Mn content is
   interpreted as an indicator of strengthened summer stratification
   associated with reduced rainfall runoff. The Ti/Si ratios are
   representative of the relative abundance of detrital inputs from the
   watershed. The combined signals of elevated Mn content and Ti/Si ratio
   for 1935-2012 CE indicate eutrophication and hypoxia in the lake and
   enhanced land erosion in the watershed, associated with the post-1970s
   intensive land use such as livestock farming. For 1640-1935 CE, the Lake
   Ohnuma record shows an antiphase relationship between the Mn content and
   Ti/Si ratio, which implies that the detrital inputs reflected the
   strength of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), and the reduced
   rainfall runoff resulted in weaker mixing, followed by depleted O-2 in
   the water column. The antiphase variation in Mn content and Ti/Si ratio
   suggest weak EASM during the Little Ice Age (similar to 1850 CE),
   followed by strong EASM between 1860 and 1929 CE. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Robust estimation of outage costs in South Korea using a machine
   learning technique: Bayesian Tobit quantile regression}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{278}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{As the industrial structure of the modern industry becomes more
   sophisticated and interdependent, accurate evaluation of customers'
   costs from power outages becomes increasingly difficult, but important.
   In this study, we propose a novel method to accurately evaluate
   customers' outage cost, Bayesian Tobit quantile regression. Using
   Bayesian Tobit quantile regression and survey data on customers'
   willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid power outages, we estimate customer
   damage functions (CDF) for the four industrial sectors in South Korea
   and compare the estimated CDFs with the estimates from a standard Tobit
   regression that many previous studies have used. Our empirical results
   reveal the two limitations of the previous analyses: CDFs estimated from
   the standard Tobit regression provide inaccurate cost estimates for
   prolonged-outages (longer than 5 h), and outliers in the survey make the
   estimates biased for short-duration outages (less than 3.5 h).
   Meanwhile, by providing five conditional quantile regression curve
   estimates (i.e., 10\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 90\%), the results from the
   Bayesian Tobit quantile regression facilitate the development of a
   robust and comprehensive interpretation of customers' outage costs. We
   also investigate the relationships between customers' outage cost and
   their idiosyncratic characteristics, employee size and electricity
   consumption. The employee size is positively related to WTP for
   outage-vulnerable customers except for less vulnerable customers in the
   industry sector, and electricity consumption is positively related to
   WTP only for such outage-vulnerable customers in all sectors. The rich
   background information about customers' outage costs provided by our
   study will help policymakers develop advanced electricity supply plans.}},

Title = {{Distinct dimensions of emotion in the human brain and their
   representation on the cortical surface}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{222}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{We experience a rich variety of emotions in daily life, and a
   fundamental goal of affective neuroscience is to determine how these
   emotions are represented in the brain. Recent psychological studies have
   used naturalistic stimuli (e.g., movies) to reveal high dimensional
   representational structures of diverse daily-life emotions. However,
   relatively little is known about how such diverse emotions are
   represented in the brain because most of the affective neuroscience
   studies have used only a small number of controlled stimuli. To reveal
   that, we measured functional MRI to obtain blood-oxygen-level-dependent
   (BOLD) responses from human subjects while they watched emotion-inducing
   audiovisual movies over a period of 3 hours. For each of the one-second
   movie scenes, we annotated the movies with respect to 80 emotions
   selected based on a wide range of previous emotion literature.
   By quantifying canonical correlations between the emotion ratings and
   the BOLD responses, the results suggest that around 25 distinct
   dimensions (ranging from 18 to 36 and being subject-dependent) of the
   emotion ratings contribute to emotion representations in the brain. For
   demonstrating how the 80 emotion categories were represented in the
   cortical surface, we visualized a continuous semantic space of the
   emotion representation and mapped it on the cortical surface. We found
   that the emotion categories were changed from unimodal to transmodal
   regions on the cortical surface. This study presents a cortical
   representation of a rich variety of emotion categories, which covers
   many of the emotional experiences of daily living.}},

   anomalies rather they are representatives of a larger intellectual,
   legal, and religious network that fared between Asia and Africa.
   Although they are evident in historical sources, they have been
   systematically forgotten in contemporary memories and scholarship while
   this forgetfulness befits the prevalent stereotyping tendencies of

Abstract = {{Chalcone derivatives namely:
   (E)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(p-tolyl)prop-2-en-1-one (MTP),
   (E)-1,3-di-p-tolylprop-2-en-1-one (DTP), and
   (E)-3-(4-(diethylarnino)phenyl)-1-(p-balyl)prop-2-en-1-one (DEP) were
   synthesized and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Mass
   spectroscopy (MS) and Infrared spectroscopy (IR). The corrosion
   mitigation of mild steel (MS) in 0.5 M H2SO4 by these compounds has been
   investigated by weight loss, electrochemical technique, surface analysis
   and theoretical studies. The investigations were performed at three
   optimum concentrations (10(-4),10(-5), and 10(-6) M) at three
   temperatures (298, 313 and 328 K) The weight loss Potentiodyanamic
   polarization (PDP) and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
   measurements showed that DEP has the maximum inhibition efficiency
   (93.3\% for highest concentration i.e. 10(-4) M) at 298 K among all
   three inhibitors. The inhibition efficiencies vary directly and
   inversely with respect to concentration and temperature respectively for
   all the additives. Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) measurements
   revealed that the chalcones are mixed-type corrosion inhibitors and
   obeyed the Langmuir adsorption isotherms. Electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS) technique further proposes that the inhibitor
   molecules mitigate corrosion process by adsorbing at the
   metal/electrolyte interfaces. Further the adsorption of chalcones at the
   metallic surface was supplemented by SEM and AFM studies where the
   decreased surface roughness of the inhibited mild steel specimens was
   observed as compared to the uninhibited spedmen. Several thermodynamic
   parameters (Delta G(ads)(0),Delta(0)(ads)and Delta S-ads(0)), DFT and MD
   theoretical parameters were calculated to explain the adsorption
   behaviour of these compounds on specimen surface. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Models issued from ecology, chemical reactions and several other
   application fields lead to semi-linear parabolic equations with
   super-linear growth. Even if, in general, blow-up can occur, these
   models share the property that mass control is essential. In many
   circumstances, it is known that this L-1 control is enough to prove the
   global existence of weak solutions. The theory is based on basic
   estimates initiated by M. Pierre and collaborators, who have introduced
   methods to prove L-2 a priori estimates for the solution.
   Here, we establish such a key estimate with initial data in L-1 while
   the usual theory uses L-2. This allows us to greatly simplify the proof
   of some results. We also establish new existence results of
   semilinearity which are super-quadratic as they occur in complex
   chemical reactions. Our method can be extended to semi-linear porous
   medium equations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Based on several semiconductor research, we have studied one of the new
   semiconductors, due to its exciting physical proprieties that in turn
   solve some problems in the photovoltaic's industry. We have divided this
   work into two parts. The first part, is to study the optical proprieties
   of ZnSnN2, as calculation of the absorption co efficient, bandgap,
   reflection coefficient, and transmission coefficient. As for the second
   part, a study of some parameters that affect the efficiency of p-CuCrO2
   (CCO)/n-ZnSnN2 (ZTN) solar cell using SCAPS-1D software, and our results
   are compared with the results of another software (wxAMPS), where
   results showed great compatibility with the presence of weak
   uncertainty. We have studied the influence of many parameters such as
   the thickness of the absorber layer (n-ZnSnN2), the thickness of the
   buffer layer (p-CuCrO2), the temperature, the series resistance (R-s),
   the shunt resistance (R-sh) and the defect density on the performance of
   ZnSnN2 solar cells which included in the real device. The photovoltaic
   parameters have been calculated using AM1.5G solar irradiance at the
   intensity of one sun, a temperature of 300 K, and considering the flat
   band condition at the interface. We have been achieving a
   high-efficiency of eta approximate to 22\% without defects. Given the
   characteristics of this new semiconductor ZnSnN2, which composed of
   earth-abundant, non-toxic and inexpensive element, as well as a high
   absorption coefficient, it can be considered as an alternative for PV
   and optoelectronic applications.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, sepiolite clay was assessed as an adsorbent for the
   removal of cationic (Methylene Blue: MB) and anionic (Direct Red-23:
   DR-23) dyes from aqueous media. Firstly, the sepiolite clay mineral was
   characterized using different instrumental techniques viz., XRD, SEM,
   EDX, FIR, X-ray Fluorescence, and BET analysis. Thereafter, the
   adsorption study was examined as a function of the adsorbent amount, the
   contact time, the aqueous phase pH, the ionic strength, and the initial
   dye amount. The data indicate that the adsorption was a function of the
   pH with high adsorption amounts of MB and DR-23, in basic and acidic,
   respectively, pH ranges. By comparing experimental data to the Langmuir
   predictions, the calculated maximum dye adsorbed amounts were 124.9 and
   649.37 mg g(-1), for MB and DR-23, respectively. Further, kinetic
   adsorption studies have shown that adsorption of MB and DR-23 from
   aqueous media onto the sepiolite follow, respectively, the pseudo-second
   order and the pseudo first-order kinetic models. On the other hand,
   Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations were performed to shed light on the
   pH-effect on the adsorptive properties of the sepiolite clay surface and
   the adsorption behavior of both hazardous MB and DR-23 dyes into the
   adsorbent surface. The better affinity of the MB molecules toward the
   sepiolite in the basic media could be related to the dispersion forces
   and electrostatic interactions. On the other hand, the DR-23 molecules
   show more favorable interaction in the acidic media as a result of the
   hydrogen bonds formed between the dye molecule and the sepiolite surface
   oxygen atoms. In addition, the negative values of interaction energies
   calculated show that the adsorption processes of both hazardous MB and
   DR-23 molecules on the sepiolite surface are spontaneous, which is in
   good agreement with the results observed experimentally. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{As the need for fuel cell systems increases, much research is underway
   to replace platinum catalysts. Therefore, non-precious metal catalysts
   composed of inexpensive metal have attracted attention. Along with
   catalyst development, the importance of electrode development is
   emphasized. In this study, two manufacturing methods using a commercial
   non-Pt catalyst (FeNC) for cathode were adopted to investigate the
   effect of the method on the performance of membrane electrode assembly
   (MEA) for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Additionally,
   the effect of different ionomer ratios in the catalyst slurry
   compositions on the electrode was studied. As a result, the MEA with
   cathode fabricated by the spray method displayed 2.87-times higher
   performance than that of MEA with cathode by gas diffusion electrode
   that is manufactured using the Doctor-blade method. The higher
   performance of the spray electrode is attributed to the large portions
   of the pores under 10 nm in the electrode estimated by the mercury
   intrusion porosimetry. Therefore, it is important to generate large
   numbers of mesopores to fabricate a high-performance electrode of the
   non-precious metal catalyst for PEMFC.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. Retrospective matched cohort analysis. Objective. The aim
   of this study was to investigate the impact of adjacent level
   ossification development (ALOD) on the affected as well as the
   next-level discs with regards to range of motion (ROM) and degenerative
   changes.
   Summary of Background Data. Although ALOD is not a rare condition in
   patients who undergo anterior cervical fusion procedures, there has been
   little discussion to date about its clinical implications.
   Methods. Patients who underwent anterior cervical instrumented fusion
   with a minimum 2-year follow-up were reviewed. Twelve patients with each
   respective ossification grade (totally 48 patients) were matched based
   on age, sex, and number of fusion levels. On the preoperative and final
   follow-up x-rays, disc height, osteophytes, ROM, and maximal listhesis
   were assessed at the segments which were one- (the adjacent segment) and
   two-level cranial (the next segment) to the uppermost fused disc. Then,
   the patients were divided into two groups according to ALOD degree:
   group 1 (grade 0- 1, N = 24) versus group 2 (grade 2-3, N = 24). The
   changes of all variables were compared between the two groups.
   Results. The mean ROM of the adjacent segment increased by 3.6 degree in
   group 1 and conversely decreased by 2.8 degree in group 2 (P = 0.002).
   The mean ROM increase of the next segment was significantly greater in
   group 2 than in group 1 (4.5 vs. 1.2 degree, P = 0.016). The osteophyte
   growth and the progression of listhesis at the next segment were
   significantly greater in group 2 (P< 0.05). Disc height of the next
   segment significantly decreased in group 2, but did not change in group
   1.
   Conclusion. Severe ALOD ( grade 2- 3) following anterior cervical fusion
   significantly reduced ROM at the affected segment and conversely
   increased motion at the next segment. This increased motion probably
   accelerated the degeneration of the next-level disc.}},

   effective. In addition to the LHT-formed oxide layer, the following
   microstructural factors affect the enhanced corrosion resistance of 1045
   steel: the lowered surface roughness, compressive residual stresses, the
   martensite formation instead of ferritic/pearlitic structure, an
   increase in the carbon content in the iron lattice due to cementite
   dissolution, refinement of the martensitic grains. The combined LHT +
   UIT process is concluded to be the most effective method providing the
   anti-corrosion performance of 1045 steel.}},

Abstract = {{A < 110 >/2 screw dislocation is commonly dissociated into two < 112 >/6
   Shockley partial dislocations on \{111\} planes in face-centered cubic
   metals. As the two partials are not purely screw, different mechanisms
   of cross-slip could take place, depending on the stacking fault energy,
   applied stress and temperature. It is crucial to classify the mechanisms
   of cross-slip because each mechanism possesses its own reaction path
   with a special activation process. In this work, molecular dynamics
   simulations have been performed systematically to explore the cross-slip
   mechanism under different stresses and temperatures in three different
   metals Ag, Cu and Ni that have different stacking fault energies of
   17.8, 44.4 and 126.8 mJ/m(2), respectively. In Ag and Cu with low
   stacking fault energy, it is observed that the cross-slip mechanism of
   screw dislocations changes from the Fleischer obtuse angle (FLOA), to
   the Friedel-Escaig (FE), and then to the FL acute angle (FLAA) at low
   temperatures, with increasing the applied stress. However, when the
   temperature increases, the FE mechanism gradually becomes dominant,
   while the FLAA only occurs at the high stress region. In particular, the
   FLOA has not been observed in Ni because of its high stacking fault
   energy. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The editorial

Title = {{Rabbit umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells: A new option for tissue
   engineering}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GENE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: The source and availability of cells for tissue engineering
   in large scale research or clinical trials requires special attention.
   We propose the idea of applying rabbit umbilical cord mesenchymal stem
   cells for this purpose.
   Methods: Here, the structure of the rabbit umbilical cord was analyzed
   and compared to that of human umbilical cord, both macroscopically and
   histologically. Next, we isolated, cultured and identified the
   proliferative activity and immunological characteristics of rabbit
   umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in vitro using mixed lymphocyte
   reaction, flow cytometry and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of biphasic calcium phosphate
   ceramic scaffolds seeded with rabbit umbilical cord mesenchymal stem
   cells in rat cranial defect models using multiple techniques, including
   radiological, histological and immunohistochemistry.
   Results: In vitro studies demonstated a high level of proliferation and
   multi-lineage differentiation potential in rabbit umbilical cord
   mesenchymal stem cells. Rabbit umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells
   exibited low immunogenicity properties and immune suppression capability
   with respect to both the allogeneic and xenogeneic immune response. The
   results of the in vivo study showed that rabbit umbilical cord
   mesenchymal stem cells could promote osteogenesis in heterogeneous
   hosts.
   Conclusions: The rabbit umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells may be a
   new source for tissue engineering.}},

   composite: Performance, mechanism and toxicity assessment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{399}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{An eco-friendly BiFeO3-MnO2 composite with dual functionalities of
   adsorption and catalysis was successfully constructed by using a simple
   one-step hydrothermal method for the removal of bisphenol A (BPA)
   pollution from water. Several characterization methods, including X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), were applied to verify the combination
   of BiFeO3 and MnO2. BiFeO3-MnO2 (BFO-MO) exhibited excellent adsorption
   and catalytic activity compared with those of pure BiFeO3. The
   adsorption process followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model and
   matched the Langmuir isotherm model. Effects of the catalyst and
   peroxymonosulfate (PMS) concentrations, pH and real water matrix were
   also analyzed, and BFO-MO displayed perfect adsorption and degradation
   performance under different conditions. Meanwhile, mineralization
   performance was tested, and the total organic carbon removal rate was
   nearly 85\%. Moreover, BFO-MO exhibited good stability and reusability
   after five cycles. Based on radical quenching experiments, SO4 center
   dot- and OH center dot were the primary reactive species responsible for
   BPA oxidation, and the possible reaction mechanism of BFO-MO/PMS was
   proposed. Finally, the degradation intermediates were identified, and
   the toxicity of intermediates was assessed. The novel BFO-MO composite
   is a promising catalyst for synchronous adsorption and degradation to
   purify wastewater.}},

Title = {{MRI detection of impairment of glymphatic function in rat after mild
   traumatic brain injury}},
Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{1747}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) on the
   glymphatic pathway using contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
   (CE-MRI) and quantified with kinetic parameters obtained from an
   advanced two-compartment model. mTBI was induced in male Wistar rats
   using a closed head impact. Animals with and without mTBI (n = 7/group)
   underwent the identical MRI protocol 10-weeks post-injury, including T2
   weighted imaging and 3D T1-weighted imaging with intra-cisterna magna
   injection of contrast agent (GdDTPA). The parameters of infusion rate,
   clearance rate and clearance time constant, characterizing the kinetic
   features of glymphatic tracer transport in a living brain, were
   quantified in multiple brain tissue regions. In the majority of examined
   regions, our quantification demonstrated significantly reduced infusion
   and clearance rates, and significantly increased clearance time constant
   in the mTBI animals compared to the healthy controls. These data
   indicate that mTBI induces chronic changes in influx and efflux of
   contrast agent and glymphatic pathway dysfunction. While the reduced
   efficiency of glymphatic function after mTBI was apparent in brain,
   regional evaluation revealed heterogeneous glymphatic effects of the
   mTBI in different anatomical regions. The suppression of glymphatic
   function, rather than the presence of focal lesions, indicates a
   persistent injury of the brain after mTBI. Thus, dynamic CE-MRI in
   conjunction with advanced kinetic analysis may offer a useful
   methodology for an objective assessment and confirmatory diagnosis of
   mTBI.}},

Title = {{Enhancement of phenylpropanoid accumulation in tartary buckwheat hairy
   roots by overexpression of MYB transcription factors}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{156}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{MYB transcription factors (TFs) play a vital role in the phenylpropanoid
   biosynthetic pathway. In the present study, we constructed an
   overexpression system for four R2R3-MYB TFs genes, namely FtMYB1,
   FtMYB2, FtMYB3, and FtMYB-Like in tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum
   tataricum). FtMYBs were expressed in a tissue-specific manner:
   expression levels of FtMYB1, FtMYB2, FtMYB3, and FtMYB-Like were highest
   in the seed1, flower, root, and flower, respectively. FtMYBs under
   different stress conditions showed that FtMYB2 was highly expressed to
   MeJA followed by NaC1, ABA, and SA, whereas other FtMYBs does not show
   significant expression when compared to control. In order to investigate
   their function in the phenylpropanoid pathway, these genes were
   over-expressed in hairy roots of F. tataricum. Results showed that the
   genes responsible for the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid, including
   FtPAL, Ft4CL, FtC4H, FtCHS, FtCHI, FtF3H, FtF3'111, FtF3' H2, FtFLS2,
   and FANS were markedly up-regulated in the transgenic lines compared
   with that in the control (beta-glucuronidase) lines. However, FtFLS1 and
   FtDFR did not show any significant expression in FtMYB2 and FtMYB3
   transgenic lines. The result of high-performance liquid chromatography
   also demonstrated that FtMYB1, FtMYB2, FtMYB3, and FtMYB-Like are likely
   to be involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in F. tataricum,
   especially, in anthocyanin accumulation. This accumulation was found to
   be 2-fold higher in the transgenic lines than that in control lines.
   However, the FtMYB3 line did not show a significant accumulation of
   anthocyanin when compared with the other three MYB lines. Overall, these
   results demonstrated that the FtMYBs play a crucial role in secondary
   metabolism, especially FtMYB2 may act as important regulators of the
   environmental stress response in F. tataricum. Hence, this study
   provides novel insights regarding the functions of R2R3-MYB TFs in the
   regulatory network that controls phenylpropanoid accumulation in
   buckwheat.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports the synthesis of size-controlled and well-dispersed
   CoFe2O4 nanocrystals through a facile thermal decomposition method, of
   which size can be simply tuned via the change of reaction time. The fcc
   Co or hcp Co impurities can be precipitated out in the CoFe2O4
   nanocrystals by further prolonging the reaction time. Magnetic
   measurements show that the pure CoFe2O4 nanocrystals show sizedependent
   ferrimagnetism at room temperature, in which the saturation
   magnetization increases and the coercivity anomalously decreases as the
   particle size increases. The variation of magnetic properties is
   attributed to the surface-randomized spin and cations redistribution
   caused by surface effect and size effect. Besides, the precipitated Co
   impurities can greatly improve the saturation magnetization and
   coercivity of the CoFe2O4 nanocrystals. This paper provides a new path
   to tailor the magnetic properties of spinel ferrite nanostructures by
   tuning the cations distribution or adding magnetic impurities. (c) 2020

Abstract = {{Recently, biodegradable macromolecules have been highly desired as a
   promising alternative for traditional oil-based plastics to work out the
   eco crisis and biological health problems triggered by microplastics.
   Herein, we presented a simple, effective, environmentally friendly and
   CO2-based foaming methodology for fabricating ultra-low-density poly
   (lactic acid)/carbon nanotube (PLA/CNTs) nanocomposite foam. By the
   gradual incorporation of CNTs, three kinds of networks generated in
   PLA/CNTs nanocomposites and had a distinct reinforcement influence on
   their melt viscoelasticity, which testified by transmission electron
   microscope, electrical conductivity and rheological property
   measurements, severally. Specifically, the storage modulus of PLA/CNTs
   nanocomposites were 3 orders of magnitude higher in contrast to pure
   PLA. Interestingly, relative to that under regular differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC), a double melting peak phenomenon appeared in the
   high-pressure DSC curves of diverse PLA specimens. Biodegradable
   PLA/CNTs nanocomposite foam was successfully fabricated with a
   super-high volume expansion ratio (VER) of 49.6 times, which could offer
   a promising strategy for developing other thermoplastic polyester foams
   with ultra-high VER to obtain some unique functional attributes. (C)

Title = {{Fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces inspired by ``stomata
   effect{''} of plant leaves via swelling-vesiculating-cracking method}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces by simple techniques is of
   significant interest. Herein, inspired by the ``stomata effect{''} of
   plant leaves, a superhydrophobic surface with bionic stomata randomly on
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is fabricated by a facile
   swelling-vesiculating-cracking method. Neither multistep modification of
   nanostructure nor introduction of low surface energy substance is
   carried out during the fabrication. The water contact angle (CA) of the
   bio-inspired superhydrophobic surfaces with stomata-like structures
   (BSSS) can reach 168.4 +/- 1 degrees with 8.9 degrees sliding angle and
   less than 10 degrees contact angle hysteresis (CAH). The structure and
   wettability of the BSSS are characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, energy dispersive
   spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The effects of
   swelling ratio, heat treatment temperature and surface morphology on the
   hydrophobicity of the BSSS are investigated systematically. Noticeably,
   the BSSS are provided with wonderful durability in organic solvents, ice
   water, and strong acid solution. Furthermore, a theoretical model for
   BSSS based on the Cassie-Baxter relation is established to elucidate the
   ``stomata effect{''}. The model reveals that the water contact angle
   will reach 180 degrees when the stomata-like structure is suitable. The
   fabrication of BSSS provides a potential strategy for the development of
   novel superhydrophobic materials.}},

Title = {{Enhancing tribological characteristics of PEEK by using PTFE composite
   as a sacrificial tribofilm-generating part in a novel dual-pins-on-disk
   tribometer}},
Journal = {{WEAR}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{460}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In this work, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)/bronze composite debris
   particles with strong tribofilm-forming abilities and slippery
   characteristics were released into a traditional pure
   poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK)-steel wear system to improve the
   tribological properties of PEEK. Wear tests were performed at room
   temperature under dry sliding conditions using a double-pin friction and
   wear test apparatus. The unfilled PEEK pins were allowed to slide
   against the steel counterparts with a fixed contact pressure of 4.0 MPa
   and speed of 0.8 m/s. Different amounts of PTFE/bronze debris particles
   were released onto the polymer/steel interface by introducing
   independent PTFE/bronze pins under different contact pressures (0.2-6.0
   MPa) in the tribosystem. Results showed that the friction level and wear
   resistance of unfilled PEEK remarkably improved through releasing the
   PTFE composite debris onto the wear track. Under the test conditions
   used in this study, the friction coefficient and wear rate of unfilled
   PEEK decreased with the increasing contact pressure of the PTFE
   composite, but the wear rate of the PTFE composite increased. When
   compared to unfilled PEEK pins working alone, the optimal friction
   coefficient of PEEK was reduced from 0.45 to below 0.10, and its wear
   rate was reduced by approximately three orders of magnitude. Analyses of
   the worn surfaces revealed that the reduction in the friction and wear
   could be attributed to the formation of the ``transfer film{''} on the
   counterpart steel surface and the ``secondary transfer film{''} on the
   unfilled worn PEEK pin surface, both triggered by the PTFE composite
   debris. The wear mechanism of PEEK then transformed to sliding between
   the transfer and secondary transfer films, thereby preventing direct
   contact between the PEEK and steel countersurface.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Abstract = {{This paper carries out three-dimensional (3D) free vibration analyses of
   laminated shells made of functionally graded materials (FGMs) in both
   thermal and non-thermal environments by a hierarchical quadrature
   element method (HQEM). Two configurations of FGM laminated shells were
   considered, the first with FGM face sheets and homogeneous core, while
   the second with homogeneous face sheets and FGM core. Effective material
   properties of the FGMs were estimated in terms of two micromechanical
   models called Voigt's rule of mixture (ROM) and Mori-Tanaka (MT) scheme.
   For shells in thermal environment, a nonlinear temperature distribution
   along thickness direction was considered while the elasticity properties
   were assumed to be temperature-dependent. Natural frequencies obtained
   by the presented formulation for FGM laminated shells under non-thermal
   conditions but varied geometric and boundary conditions were compared
   with those obtained by two-dimensional (2D) finite element method (FEM)
   and semi-analytical approaches in literatures first to assess the
   correctness and accuracy. Then the influence of volume fraction index,
   core thickness, and temperature gradient on natural frequencies of FGM
   laminated shells under thermal environment were investigated. The
   threedimensional formulations of this work were shown to need similar
   computational cost as 2D ones but with the accuracy of 3D theory.}},

Title = {{A novel method to predict the stiffness evolution of in-service wind
   turbine blades based on deep learning models}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{252}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Since wind turbines operate in a complex environment for long term, the
   fatigue behavior of the blades can be influenced by wind, illumination,
   moisture, temperature, and so forth. For wind turbine blade
   manufacturers, the determination of their fatigue limit before delivery
   is necessary and fatigue acceleration experiments usually require a lot
   of labor and experimental costs. As a machine learning paradigm, deep
   learning focuses on the inherent hierarchical models of data and has
   achieved notable success in computer vision, speech recognition, natural
   language processing, etc. Aimed at reducing the time and the costs
   during fatigue tests, this paper studies a training-based method for
   wind turbine blade stiffness prediction using time series stiffness data
   under fatigue tests. Based on deep learning methods including
   convolutional neural network, long-short term memory network and the
   hybrid network, the residual stiffness of the blade with fatigue life
   under fatigue tests is obtained by combining the fatigue historical
   data. The obtained results show that the developed models can learn
   features directly from raw stiffness data and complete the residual
   stiffness prediction in succession. White Gaussian noise with different
   signal-to-noise ratios is also added to all stiffness data to
   demonstrate the models' feasibility of stiffness prediction.}},

Title = {{Exploring the energy-saving potential of electromagnetic induction
   pavement via magnetic concentrating technique}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{211}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Electromagnetic induction pavement (EMIP) is designed to heat the
   pavement through energy conver-sion to achieve pavement functions.
   However, there is a low energy conversion efficiency caused by the
   magnetic energy leakage phenomenon. To solve this problem, two kinds of
   asphalt magnetic absorption layer AMAL, including AMAL(1) and AMAL(2),
   were creatively designed by the magnetic concentrating technique. The
   direct tension test and shear test were conducted to test the road
   performance of AMAL. Meanwhile, the ice-melting experiments and
   self-healing experiments were conducted to compare energy conversion
   efficiency between conventional EMIP and new pavement heating system
   (NPHS) with AMAL. Results show that the shear strength and tensile
   strength of the AMAL(1) was 0.95Mpa and 0.20Mpa, and that of the AMAL(2)
   was 1.07Mpa and 0.21Mpa, both of which meet the requirements of road
   performance. Besides, the energy conversion efficiency was highest when
   the waste steel shavings content was 6\% in ice-melting and self-healing
   experiments, whether AMAL(1) or AMAL(2). The energy conversion
   efficiency of the NPHS with AMAL(1) is greater than that with AMAL(2).
   Based on these results, AMAL(1) was recommended. Finally, the results
   for the economic cost of unit NPHS show that the power cost saved by
   AMAL in 1 h is three times its construction cost. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Transformation reactivity of parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and
   the formation trend of halogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in
   the presence of bromide ion during chlorination}},

Abstract = {{The chlorination of parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has
   become a recognized fact during chlorination disinfection. However,
   bromide ion (Br-), which exists in natural water, may fundamentally
   affect the reaction mechanism. This study investigated the
   transformation mechanism of PAHs and the formation trend of halogenated
   PAHs (HPAHs) in the presence of Br- during chlorination. Twelve PAHs
   were divided into two groups, active and inactive, containing only
   hypochlorous acid (HOCl). However, the presence of Br- accelerated the
   reaction process of active PAHs. M a high Br concentration, inactive
   PAHs transformed to become ``false active{''}. Two reaction types,
   including electrophilic substitution and single electron transfer
   reactions, occurred in PAHs during chlorination. We screened the
   transformation products using comprehensive two-dimensional gas
   chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOF MS) and
   identified the occurrence of two reaction types. The presence of Br-
   affected the species of transformation products. In general, the number
   of species of chlorinated PAHs decreased and those of brominated PAHs
   increased with an increase in the Br - concentration. In addition, we
   first observed the occurrence of 2 types of brominated and chlorinated
   acenaphthenes, predicted the formation pathways, and inferred the most
   probable structure using a quantum chemical computation method.
   Therefore, the formation mechanism of HPAHs in drinking water during the
   chlorination treatment process was evaluated. The presence of HPAHs in
   drinking water requires more attention.}},

Title = {{Polychaetes (Perinereis helleri) reared in sand beds filtering nutrients
   from shrimp (Penaeus monodon) culture ponds can transiently carry IHHNV}},
Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{528}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A polychaete-assisted sand filter (PASF) system has been developed to
   help remove nutrients from aquaculture pond wastewater whilst also
   producing polychaetes that are highly prized as bait by recreational
   anglers and as a dietary supplement to improve the fecundity of shrimp
   broodstock. Whilst rearing polychaetes in PASF beds offers potential to
   reduce impacts of sourcing them from the wild, the use of wastewater
   from ponds rearing shrimp such as Penaeus monodon will present a
   biosecurity risk of viruses being transferred to, and potentially
   amplified in, the worms. To assess such risks for transmitting
   infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV), groups
   of 3 or 4 PASF beds seeded with sand worm (Perinereis helleri) juveniles
   were supplied with wastewater from ponds of P. monodon with either
   high-load or low-load IHHNV infections. TaqMan real-time qPCR identified
   low loads of IHHNV (<= 878 IHHNV DNA copies 200 ng(-1) TNA) in most
   worms from PASF beds supplied wastewater from the high-load pond. IHHNV
   was either not detected or detected at the qPCR test sensitivity limits
   in worms from beds supplied wastewater from the low-load pond. Purging
   harvested worms of their gut contents in clean filtered seawater for 2
   days significantly reduced IHHNV loads. Reverting PASF beds to clean
   seawater for 8 weeks before harvest also significantly reduced worm
   loads of IHHNV. Daily additions of a commercial probiotic to the sand
   bed surface for 4 weeks prior to clean seawater application provided no
   discernible benefit to IHHNV clearance. While clearly demonstrated to be
   capable of carrying IHHNV, the remediation measures examined suggest
   potential to ameliorate the infection transmission risks of P. helleri
   reared in PASF beds supplied with shrimp pond wastewater as a nutrient
   source.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY}},

Abstract = {{Biobutanol is a highly competitive alternative biofuel for fossil fuels
   in the future. However, there is no consensus on the soot formation of
   the four butanol isomers. The soot formation characteristics of the pure
   n-heptane (B00) and the volumetric mixture 50\% n-heptane/50\% butanol
   isomer (H50B50) flames were investigated on a coflow burner. The
   quantitative soot volume fraction, qualitative OH radical concentration,
   morphological parameters and nanostructures of soot particles were
   measured by the two-color laser induced incandescence (TC-LII) method,
   the planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) method, and transmission
   electron microscope (TEM) analysis. Compared with B00 flame, the soot
   loading of n-heptane/n-butanol (N50), n-heptane/s-butanol (S50) and
   n-heptane/i-butanol (I50) flames decreased by 62\%, 40\% and 33\%,
   respectively, whereas the n-heptane/t-butanol (T50) flame increased by
   57\%. The oxidation of soot particles was jointly affected by the region
   and the peak concentration of OH radical. As the flame developed, the
   primary particle diameter initially increased and then decreased in the
   order T50 > I50 > S50 > N50. Regarding soot nanostructure, the fringe
   tortuosity and inter-fringe spacing of soot sampled in the three flames
   decreased in the order I50 > S50 > T50. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Microwave devices, designed by the electromagnetic characteristics of
   spin waves, are widely used in radio frequency circuits and microwave
   systems, such as magnetic tunable fillers, frequency multiplier, and
   signal-to-noise ratio enhancers. In order to manufacture these devices,
   it is not only the saturation magnetization (4 pi M-s) and ferromagnetic
   resonance linewidth (Delta H) that need to be regulated, but also the
   exchange stiffness (A). In this study, the Fe (t nm)/Ni81Fe19 (50 nm)/Fe
   (t nm) multilayer films were proposed to regulate the 4 pi M-s, Delta H,
   and A, which were fabricated using electron beam evaporation, and the
   dynamic magnetic properties of the film were studied by ferromagnetic
   resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. Firstly, we obtain the 4 pi M-s, gamma and
   H-a by fitting the uniform FMR mode. Then we obtain the exchange
   stiffness by fitting the first (p = 1) perpendicular standing spin wave
   (PSSW) mode. With the increasing Fe film thickness, the calculated
   saturation magnetization increased from 9250 to 14060Gs, FMR linewidth

Abstract = {{The radioactivity and toxicity of actinides impede experimental
   investigation into their chemical properties in the condensed phase. The
   rapid development of computational methods and computational facilities
   allows for alternative experimental methods, including the use of a
   molecular force field, to gain insight into the coordination chemistry
   and dynamics of actinides. The key to this method is the force fieild
   parameters. In the present work, we report the development and
   validation of the AMBER (Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement)
   force field parameters for Np4+, Am3+, and Cm3+ based on the
   experimentally determined ion-oxygen distance (100). The parameter 0 0.1
   set, together with that reported for Th4+, U4+, and Pu4+, was then
   applied to investigate the coordination chemistry and dynamics of these
   six actinide ions in the aqueous phase, in the absence and presence of
   counterions NO3-, and CO32- . The simulations showed a shorter An-Ow
   coordination length for An(4+) than for An(3+), and for higher atomic
   numbers of ions in the same valence state. Th4+ preferentially existed
   in a 10-coordinated state, adopting a BCASP (bicapped square antiprism)
   conformation, while the other ions tended to be 9-coordinated with a
   CASP (capped square antiprism) conformation. The only exception was
   Cm3+, which adopted a TCTP (tricapped trigonal prism) conformation. The
   results also showed that the water molecules around An(4+) were more
   ordered than those around An(3+), as indicated by the smaller angles
   between the An-Ow vector and the dipole direction of the water ligand.
   This highly ordered structure of coordinated water affected their
   translation and rotation, i.e., the diffusion coefficient and rotational
   relaxation time of the water molecules around An(4+) were smaller than
   those in the case of An(3+) due to the stronger electrostatic
   interaction between An(4+) and ligating water. The hydration free
   energies of the targeted actinide ions were also calculated by the FEP
   (free energy perturbation) method. An(4+) underwent a greater degree of
   stabilization than did An(3+) upon hydration; among the ions in the same
   oxidation states, those with a higher atomic number were better
   stabilized. In summary, the results of the simulations were consistent
   with the literature data in terms of the hydration structure,
   coordination of counterions, and hydration free energy of the actinide
   ions. The ability of the parameter set to describe the dynamics of water
   in the vicinity of actinides remains to be verified due to the lack of
   reference data. We tentatively propose that it may be used to
   investigate the coordination chemistry of actinides both in
   conformational analysis and binding strength, while special care should
   be taken when studying the kinetics of the solvated system. This work is
   expected to enrich our understanding of the solution behavior of
   An(3+)/An(4+) at the force field level.}},

Abstract = {{The flexible conductive polymer composites (CPCs) based sensor that can
   detect strain, temperature or chemical vapor exhibits a huge application
   prospect in many fields such as soft robotics, electronic skin, thermal
   protection and electrical nose, etc. However, it is still a challenge to
   integrate multi functions into one flexible electronic device. In this
   paper, a flexible, ultralight and highly conductive multifunctional
   sensor of graphite nanosheet (GN)/polyamide 66 (PA66) nanofibers
   composite is prepared by electrospinning fibrous mat process and
   ultrasonic decoration method. The morphology and the structure were
   characterized by SEM, FTIR, Raman and TGA methods in detail. Attributed
   to the sensitive three-dimensional conductive network constructed by
   anchoring the GN into the electrospun PA66 nanofibers with porous
   structure, this flexible sensor offers the excellent multifunctional
   response for strain, temperature and gas sensing. In addition, the
   prepared GN/PA66 nanocomposite was successfully employed as a
   multifunctional sensor and applied in the detection of human motion and
   physiological ECG signal. Moreover, benefitted from the high aspect
   ratio of the GN/PA66 nano composite, the flexible sensitive sensor can
   also monitor the temperature as well and show a typical negative
   temperature coefficient (NTC) effect of resistance. Besides, the polar
   chemical vapor of formic acid, DMF and NH3 center dot H2O can be
   detected accurately whatever the physical states (flat, folding,
   twisting and knotting) of the flexible sensor. This work provides an
   effective strategy for integrating the multifunctional flexible
   electronics with high performance to satisfy the next-generation
   wearable electronics.}},

   in Linking the East Asian Winter and Summer Monsoons}},

Abstract = {{Eurasian snow, one of the most important factors that influence the
   Asian monsoons, has long been viewed as a useful predictor for seasonal
   monsoon prediction. In this study, observations and model simulations
   are used to demonstrate a bridging role of the winter snow anomaly over
   northern China and southern Mongolia (NCSM) in the relationship between
   the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and the East Asian summer monsoon
   (EASM). Enhanced snow in NCSM results in local surface and tropospheric
   cooling, strengthening the EAWM through cold-air intrusion induced by
   northerly wind anomalies. In turn, the stronger EAWM provides a
   favorable condition for enhanced snowfall over East Asia to the south,
   indicating an active snow-EAWM interaction. The continental cooling
   could be maintained until summer due to the memory effect of snowmelt
   and moistening as well as the snow-monsoon interaction in the spring,
   causing changes in the meridional temperature gradient and associated
   upper-level westerlies in the summer. The interaction between the
   strengthened westerlies over the northern Tibetan Plateau and the
   topography of the plateau could lead to anomalous downstream convergence
   and compensating divergence to the south. Therefore, anomalous cyclonic
   circulation and increased rainfall occur over northeastern China and the
   Korean Peninsula, but anticyclonic circulation and decreased rainfall
   appear over the subtropical East Asia-Pacific region. Moreover, limited
   analysis shows that, compared to sea surface temperature feedback, the
   direct impact of snow anomaly on the EAWM-EASM connection seems more
   important.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly in
   the United States since January 2020.
   Methods. We estimated mean epidemic doubling time, an important measure
   of epidemic growth, nationally, by state, and in association with
   stay-at-home orders.
   Results. The epidemic doubling time in the United States was 2.68 days
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 2.30-3.24 days) before widespread
   mitigation efforts, increasing by 460\% to 15 days (12.89-17.94 days)
   during the mitigation phase. Among states without stay-at-home orders,
   the median increase in doubling time was 60\% (95\% CI, 9.2-223.3),
   compared with 269\% (95\% CI, 277.0-394.0) for states with stay-at-home
   orders.
   Conclusions. Statewide mitigation strategies were strongly associated
   with increased epidemic doubling time.}},

Title = {{Temporal change of the magma plumbing system at Galeras volcano,
   Colombia, revealed by repeated seismic tomography in 2009-2018}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{406}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{We performed repeated three-dimensional seismic tomography in 2009-2018
   for the area influenced by the in-tersection of the Silvia-Pijao
   (Buesaco) and Cauca-Almaguer fault systems beneath Galeras volcano,
   Colombia. We analyzed two periods, 2009-2012 and 2013-2018, which were
   characterized by explosive eruptive activity and relative quiescence at
   Galeras, respectively. We used Pand S-wave arrival times of 2848
   (2009-2012) and 2289 (2013-2018) earthquakes that occurred beneath the
   volcano. P- and S-wave velocity (Vp and Vs, respectively) anomalies and
   their changes between the two periods were interpreted to be associated
   with magma movement in the volcanic plumbing system, which was
   controlled by the intersection of the faults. Two possible pathways of
   magma ascent and accumulation were identified in the fault systems. One,
   located SW of the active crater, consisted of areas with high V-p/V-s
   values ( 1.9) at depths of -2 to 4 km below sea level, and the other
   located NE of the active crater with high and low V-p/V-s values. The
   low-V-p/V-s (<1.7) area at depths of 0 to 2 km may represent vesiculated
   magma that was partly erupted during explosive eruptions in 2009-2010.
   These anomalies, found in 2009-2012, displayed clear changes in
   2013-2018. Large surface deformation observed between January 2013 and
   February 2014 may be associated with magma movement from the SW pathway.
   The largest volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquake, with a magnitude of 5.1,
   ever recorded at Galeras occurred on 12 June 2018 and was followed by a
   swarm of VT earthquakes. This VT activity may have been caused by magma
   intrusion along the NE pathway. On the basis of our tomographic images
   and geodetic, petrological, and geochemical results, we propose a model
   of the plumbing system beneath Galeras during 2009-2018. (C) 2020

Title = {{Use of recurrence plots for identification and extraction of patterns in
   humpback whale song recordings}},
Journal = {{BIOACOUSTICS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SOUND AND ITS RECORDING}},
Abstract = {{Humpback whale song is comprised of well-structured distinct levels of
   organisation: combinations of sounds, repetition of combinations, and a
   sequence of repetitions, which have no clear silent intervals. This
   continuous sound output can be hard to delimit, rather, it could be
   interpreted as a long series of states of a system. Recurrence plots are
   graphical representations of such series of states and have been used to
   describe animal behaviour previously. Here, we aim to apply this tool to
   visualise and recognise structures traditionally used in inferences
   about behaviour (songs and themes) in the series of units manually
   extracted from recordings of humpback whales. Data from the Abrolhos
   bank, Brazil were subjected to these analyses. Our analytical tool has
   proven efficient in identifying themes and songs from continuous
   recordings avoiding some of the human perception bias and caveats.
   Furthermore, our song extraction is robust to errors coming from both
   manual and automated transcriptions, constructing a level of description
   largely independent of the first stage of analysis.}},

Title = {{Density functional theory study on the interaction of chitosan monomer
   with TiO2, SiO2 and carbon nanotubes}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{255}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In the present work, theoretical studies based on density functional
   theory (DFT) have performed to comprehend the interaction between the
   Chitosan (CS) monomer and three types of nanotubes, namely TiO2 nanotube
   (TiO2NT), SiO2 nanotube (SiO2NT) and Carbon nanotube (CNT). First, the
   geometry of nanotubes and CS monomer and various configuration of their
   composites have optimized. Subsequently, the adsorption energy and
   equilibrium distance between CS monomer and nanotubes for the
   energetically most favorable Structure have calculated by the DFT
   method. The achieved results indicate that CS monomer has a tendency to
   be chemisorbed onto the surface of TiO2NT (E-i = -1.41 eV) while the
   type of interactions for the SiO2NT (E-i = -0.24 eV) and CNT (E-i = -
   0.22 eV) systems are noncovalent and the CS monomer physisorbed onto the
   surface of these nanotubes. It was found that the interaction of CS with
   TiO2NT due to the shorter equilibrium distance and greater adsorption
   energy is stronger than other nanotubes. We have also investigated the
   influence of TiO2NT diameter on the adsorption feature, and the results
   revealed that the adsorption energy between CS and TiO2NTs reduces by
   increasing TiO2NTs diameter. Moreover, the electronic density of state
   (DOS) of the energetically most favorable composites was analyzed. The
   findings of the current work would be very beneficial for scientists to
   explore the potential applications of these nanocomposite materials in
   biomedical field such as drug delivery and tissue engineering.}},

Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{211}},
Pages = {{725-731}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Bifacial and flexible Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 (CIGS) thin-film solar cells with
   superstrate-type structure were fabricated. For this fabrication, the
   substrate-type solar cells were first transferred from Mo/Glass
   substrates to 50-mu m-thick flexible fluorinated ethylene propylene
   (FEP) copolymer films as superstrates using a lift-off process. The
   300nm-thick In2O3:SnO2 (ITO) thin-films were subsequently deposited on
   the rear sides of the CIGS absorber layers as back contacts (BC) of the
   finished bifacial devices with the structure of
   FEP/Epoxy/Al/Ni/Zn0.9Mg0.1O: Al/Zn0.8Mg0.2O/CdS/CIGS/ITO/Ni/Al.
   Particular attention was paid to maintain the high optical and
   electrical transport properties of ITO-BC as well as to improve the
   Ohmic-like contact behavior at the CIGS/ITO interface to improve cell
   performances. Under the optimized ITO preparation, the resulting ITO
   thin film possesses the average optical transparency of ITO (>77\%) in
   the wavelength range of 400-1100 nm, and the resistivity of 6.1 x 10-4
   Omega cm with corresponding high carrier mobility of 42.8 cm(2)/Vs, as
   well as Ohmic-like characteristics at the CIGS/ITO interface can be
   realized with shunt resistance as low as 5.5 Omega cm(2). Consequently,
   the flexible and bifacial CIGS thin-film solar cell was fabricated with
   efficiencies of 9.1\% and 2.4\% for frontside and backside
   illuminations, respectively. In this study, highly transparent and
   conductive ITO thin films have been successfully used as BC in flexible
   and bifacial CIGS solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{Background. MMV390048 is the first Plasmodium phosphatidylinositol
   4-kinase inhibitor to reach clinical development as a new antimalarial.
   We aimed to characterize the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antimalarial
   activity of a tablet formulation of MMV390048.
   Methods. A 2-part, phase 1 trial was conducted in healthy adults. Part 1
   was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending
   dose study consisting of 3 cohorts (40, 80, 120 mg MMV390048). Part 2
   was an open-label volunteer infection study using the Plasmodium
   fakiparum induced blood-stage malaria model consisting of 2 cohorts (40
   mg and 80 mg MMV390048).
   Results. Twenty four subjects were enrolled in part 1 (n = 8 per cohort,
   randomized 3:1 MMV390048:placebo) and 15 subjects were enrolled in part
   2 (40 mg {[}n = 7] and 80 mg {[}n = 8] cohorts). One subject was
   withdrawn from part 2 (80 mg cohort) before dosing and was not included
   in analyses. No serious or severe adverse events were attributed to
   MMV390048. The rate of parasite clearance was greater in subjects
   administered 80 mg compared to those administered 40 mg (clearance
   half-life 5.5 hours {[}95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, 5.2-6.0 hours]
   vs 6.4 hours {[}95\% CI, 6.0-6.9 hours]; P = .005).
   Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling estimated a minimum inhibitory
   concentration of 83 ng/mL and a minimal parasiticidal concentration that
   would achieve 90\% of the maximum effect of 238 ng/mL, and predicted
   that a single 120-mg dose would achieve an adequate clinical and
   parasitological response with 92\% certainty.
   Conclusions. The safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of
   MMV390048 support its further development as a partner drug of a
   single-dose combination therapy for malaria.}},

Abstract = {{Surface-relief gratings fabricated through nanoimprint lithography (NIL)
   are prone to topographic distortion induced by resist shrinkage.
   Characterizing the impact of this effect on blazed diffraction
   efficiency is particularly important for applications in astrophysical
   spectroscopy at soft x-ray wavelengths (lambda approximate to 0.5 - 5
   nm) that call for the mass-production of large-area grating replicas
   with sub-micron, sawtooth surface-relief profiles. A variant of NIL that
   lends itself well for this task is substrate-conformal imprint
   lithography (SCIL), which uses a flexible, composite stamp formed from a
   rigid master template to imprint nanoscale features in an inorganic
   resist that cures thermodynamically through a silica sol-gel process.
   While SCIL enables the production of several hundred imprints before
   stamp degradation and avoids many of the detriments associated with
   large-area imprinting in NIL, the sol-gel resist suffers shrinkage
   dependent on the post -imprint cure temperature. Through atomic force
   microscopy and diffraction-efficiency testing at beamline 6.3.2 of the
   Advanced Light Source, the impact of this effect on blaze response is
   constrained for a similar to 160-nm-period grating replica cured at 90
   degrees C. Results demonstrate a similar to 2 degrees reduction in blaze
   angle relative to the master grating, which was fabricated by
   anisotropic wet etching in < 311 >-oriented silicon to yield a facet
   angle close to 30 degrees. (c) 2020 Optical Society of America under the

Journal = {{FLUID PHASE EQUILIBRIA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{523}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Vapor - liquid - liquid equilibrium (VLLE) for water + MTBE + ethanol
   and water + MTBE 1-butanol ternary systems have been measured in a
   modified dynamic Guillespie type cell at the isobaric condition of 101.3
   kPa and over the temperature range from 325.6 to 328.9 K for water +
   MTBE + ethanol mixture and from 329.5 to 355.1 K for water + MTBE +
   1-butanol mixture. The quality of the measured data is thermodynamically
   validated by the L/W Wisniak's consistency point- point test. According
   to the experimental results, the liquid - liquid equilibria are Type I
   for water + MTBE + ethanol mixture and Type II for water + MTBE
   1-butanol mixture. The VLLE for water + MTBE + ethanol mixture dis-
   plays heterogeneous ternary azeotrope whereas the water + MTBE 1-butanol
   mixture is a zeotropic ternary mixture. The experimental VLLE data for
   both ternary mixtures are correlated by a modified version of the
   nonrandom two-liquids (NRTL) activity coefficients model, which
   incorporates a ternary contribution. This ternary contribution reduces
   the global average absolute deviation from 5 \% to 1.3 \% for water +
   MTBE + ethanol mixture and from 3.1\% to 1.9 \% for water + MTBE
   1-butanol mixture.
   The experimental isobaric VLLE data of the ternary mixtures are also
   accurately modeled by applying the Peng-Robinson Stryjek-Vera equation
   of state appropriately extended to mixtures employing the modified
   Huron-Vidal mixing rule with the NRTL activity coefficient model. This
   model allows directly transferring the experimental excess Gibbs energy
   function to the EoS model for equilibrium calculation purposes. This
   theoretical framework shows that experimental VLLE data can be
   accurately predicted and provide a route to interpolate values of the
   phase equilibrium. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Grotta d'Oriente, a coastal cave located on the island of Favignana
   (Sicily, Italy) is a key site for the study of the early human
   colonization of Sicily. Inside the cave, during different field
   excavations, three burials attributable to the Late Upper Palaeolithic
   and Mesolithic were found. The Mesolithic Oriente B individual, directly
   dated at 9,377 +/- 25 uncal BP, was previously assigned to HV1
   haplogroup using a traditional approach. However, it is well known that
   PCR based methods are prone to erroneous haplotype or haplogroup
   determination. In order to redefine the mitochondrial lineage of this
   Mesolithic hunter-gatherer and explore its phylogenetic position, we
   target-enriched and sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of
   Oriente B. Moreover, we conducted a morphometric analysis to assess its
   phenetic affinities.
   Oriente B individual was classified into U2'3'4'7'8'9 haplogroup. In
   Sicily, this lineage has also been found on the Upper Palaeolithic
   Oriente C and Early Mesolithic individuals from Grotta dell'Uzzo. Our
   results show significant genetic and morphological similarities in
   Sicilian Early Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, presumably because of
   genetic drift processes. Furthermore, dating the emergence of the
   ``Sicilian Glade{''}, we speculate that Epigravettian hunter-gatherers
   carrying U2'3'4'7'8'9 haplogroup might be the first settlers of Sicily
   arrived from the Italian peninsula by the crossing of a temporary
   land-bridge around the Last Glacial Maximum. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{TiO2/PVA nanocomposites film was assembled using a solution casting
   technique, whereas the synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles was achieved by
   the Sol-gel method. The control in TiO2 phases nanoparticle from

   and temperature of the calcination process, which belief as a new
   technique for that purpose. TiO2 nanoparticles with different phases
   employed as a filler and PVA as a host matrix. The established of TiO2
   with different phases were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). At the
   same time, the shape and the approximate crystal size carried out by
   Transmission electron microscope (TEM), the XRD reveals the existence of
   anatase, rutile and mixed TiO2 phases with average crystallites size (D)
   of 7 nm 78 nm and 42 nm for anatase, rutile, and mix phases,
   respectively. TEM of TiO2 nanoparticles indicates the spherical shape of
   the rutile phase, and the tetragonal shape appears clearly in anatase,
   and the impact of the calcination process on crystal size was
   considerable. The grain size noted in the TEM image has a good agreement
   with the XRD results estimated by applying Scherrer's equation. The
   optical properties of TiO2/PVA composite films have been examined. The
   red-shifted of the direct optical band gap is achieved from 3.25 to 2.63
   eV for phase transformation from anatase to rutile. The refractive index

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigated sonophotocatalytic degradation of
   sulfamethoxazole (SUX) antibiotic in pharmaceutical wastewaters by
   employing a ternary heterostructure catalyst composed of MgO and ZnO
   nano particles anchored on graphene nanosheets (MZG) under UV-A (LED)
   and US irradiations as a novel study. Synthesis of MZG was performed via
   multi-step hydrothermal-assisted method and characterized by employing
   XRD, FT-IR, FESEM, BET, EIS, DRS, EDS, TEM, EDX, and TGA techniques. By
   introduction of ZnO and graphene, photocatalytic activity of MgO was
   enhanced in both UV and visible regions. A good catalytic potential and
   significant synergistic effect was obtained for ternary system
   (MZG/LED/US) compared to binary and single processes. After 120 min of
   sonophotocatalytic treatment, complete degradation of SUX (55 mg/L) can
   be attained at MZG: 0.8 g/L, pH: 9.0, LED power: 90 W and US power: 250
   W. Kinetic studies revealed that sonophotocatalytic degradation process
   followed the pseudo first-order kinetic model. HO\% species were
   detected as dominant oxidative free radicals which contributed in SUX
   degradation process. A comprehensive possible mechanism was proposed for
   photocatalysis and sonocatalysis processes involved in MZG/LED/US system
   in detail. The nanocomposite was reused for six successive cycles with
   maximum 9.8\% drop in degradation efficiency. An efficient improvement
   was achieved in the biodegradability of real pharmaceutical wastewater
   after treatment by MZG/LED/US with 94\% and 81\% removal of COD and TOC,
   respectively. To conclude, combining MZG, LED and US waves can be
   utilized as a novel and efficient strategy to treat real pharmaceutical
   wastewaters in practical applications, owing to high performance in
   degradation/mineralization, excellent reusability potential and high
   activity in sonolysis and photolysis systems.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY}},

Abstract = {{The design of safe and cost-efficient CO2-transportation systems is an
   integral part of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) deployment. To achieve
   this, accurate transient flow models capturing the occurrence of gas,
   liquid and solid CO2 are needed. These in turn rely on experimental
   validation. In this work, we present a new experimental facility
   designed to capture pressure and temperature during the depressurization
   of CO2 and CO2-rich mixtures in a tube at high spatial and temporal
   resolution. Experiments with pure CO2 starting from both gaseous and
   dense (liquid) states are presented, and a reference experiment with N-2
   is included. The experimental results for both pressure and temperature
   are analysed by comparison with predictions by a homogeneous equilibrium
   model. Emphasis is put on the decompression-wave speed, of particular
   relevance for running-ductile fracture in CO2-transportation pipelines.
   We observe good agreement with predicted decompression-wave speeds in
   the single-phase region, and fair agreement for two-phase flows when the
   calculations are based on the assumption of equilibrium. However, the
   observed `pressure plateau', a key factor in the prediction of
   running-ductile fracture, can be significantly lower than that
   calculated assuming equilibrium. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {{Many tertiary language courses have some online components as part of

   performance. Results obtained from beginners' Japanese language students
   at a tertiary institute were examined by conducting three-way
   comparisons amongst the average scores and average number of attempts of
   the online tests, and the final examination score in order to ascertain
   the relationship between the number of attempts of online tests and the
   online test scores and the final examination scores. The results
   indicated that the number of attempts of quizzes cannot be used as an
   indicator of possible good final examination score, although the
   contents of quizzes and the final examination were closely related. In
   addition, although the online quizzes were created as preparation for
   the final examination, even the quiz average score cannot be the direct
   indicator for a successful final examination score.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium sulfide nanoparticles (MgS NPs) is a nanomaterial that has an
   important place in diagnosis, treatment, diagnosis, and drug delivery
   systems. Neuroblastoma, a type of brain cancer, is an extremely
   difficult cancer to treat with today's treatment options. This study was
   carried out to determine the cytotoxic, oxidant, and antioxidant effects
   on the neuroblastoma cancer line (SH-SY5Y cell line) along with the
   green synthesis and characterization of MgS NPs structures. MgS NPs were
   synthesized by green synthesis using Na2S and Punica granatum, a cleaner
   method for toxic effects, and characterized using Scanning Electron
   Microscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction
   methods. In cell culture, SH-SY5Y cells were grown in a suitable
   nutrient medium under favorable conditions. Five different doses of MgS
   NPs (10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mu g/mL) were applied to the cell line for
   24 h. The analysis of the MgS NPs applications was performed with MTT
   cytotoxicity test and total oxidant and total antioxidant tests.
   According to the data obtained, 75 mu g/mL MgS NPs application decreased
   cancer cell viability up to 48.54\%. MgS NPs exhibited a dose-dependent
   effect on the SH-SY5Y cell line. Also, it was determined that MgS NPs
   increased oxidant activity in neuroblastoma cells, which was compatible
   with the cytotoxicity test. As a result, MgS NPs exhibited an effective
   activity on the neuroblastoma cell line. It was clearly seen that NPs
   obtained by green synthesis prevented the related cancer line from
   proliferating.}},

Title = {{Assessment of tool wear mechanisms in high-pressure jet-assisted turning
   process of a nickel-based superalloy}},
Journal = {{WEAR}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{460}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Nickel-based superalloys have many beneficial mechanical and
   manufacturing properties and have been used in various industries.
   However, the machining process and efficiency of these superalloys can
   be challenging due to several non-ideal factors such as undesirable
   chips flow, localized plastic deformation of the workpiece, and
   especially the tool wear. It has been shown that hybrid processes,
   including high-pressure jet-assisted machining (HPJAM), can be performed
   to improve machining efficiency. This work represents experimental
   methods to investigate and to quantify the effect of high-pressure
   jet-assisted machining on the tool wear mechanisms. The influence of
   variation of the turning parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate,
   and cutting fluid pressure on wear mechanisms was investigated along the
   tool rake face with respect to the position of the nozzles. An optical
   microscope, a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and energy-dispersive
   x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were used to assess the experiments.
   Experimental results showed that the abrasion wear was reduced, as the
   cutting fluid pressure was increased. The adhesion wear was minimized
   when an optimum fluid pressure range was used. The same behavior was
   observed in the development of notch wear. According to the measured
   parameters, the minimum notch wear occurred at the pressure of 70-bar.
   The tool life could be maximized by reduction of the tool wear, and the
   tool wear mechanisms can be better controlled if the high-pressure
   jet-assisted machining is performed under an optimum pressure range.
   Therefore, the tool wear, tool life, and material removal rates can be
   improved by optimizing the pressure levels and cutting parameters.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{418}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are
   immune-mediated diseases that occur in patients with tumors and can be
   associated with onconeural antibodies. Our aim was to describe our
   cohort of patients with PNS.
   Methods: Retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients followed in a
   Portuguese tertiary center, with autoantibodies against intracellular
   antigens from our PNS panel, between 2012 and 2017.
   Results: Among the 882 patients with suspected PNS (1029 samples), 37
   (4.2\%) had positive and 27 (3.1\%) weak positive antibodies. A total of
   17 (29.3\%) PNS were diagnosed, 5 were classic syndromes. Autoantibodies
   found were anti-Yo, anti-Hu, anti-titin, anti-Ma2, anti-SOX1, anti-Ri
   and anti-CV2/CRMP5. They were associated with thymoma, breast, colon,
   parotid gland and lung (small-cell, neuroendocrine or carcinoid) cancer.
   Among the 17 PNS patients, no tumor was found in 4 (mean follow-up of 46
   months); no patients improved with tumor treatment, while 8 improved
   with immunotherapy; ten patients (59\%) died during follow-up. Twenty
   (60.6\%) patients with positive antibodies and 21 (84.0\%) with weak
   positive were not diagnosed with a PNS.
   sions: PNS had highly heterogenous clinical presentations. Response to
   tumor treatment was overall poor, with an unfavorable prognosis. In our
   cohort, only 29.3\% of the patients with positive antibodies were
   diagnosed with a PNS.}},

Pages = {{1871-1881}},

Abstract = {{Study Objectives: Social relationships are an understudied factor
   affecting insomnia. In particular, these effects have not been evaluated
   in the context of sex differences. In this study, we investigated
   differences between sexes with regard to the association between
   insomnia symptoms and social relationships.
   Methods: We used data from 2681 middle-aged adults (aged 40-64 years;
   females, 68.8\%) from the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases Etiology
   Research Center project. Insomnia symptoms were defined as difficulty
   with sleep induction or maintenance >= 3 nights per week. We assessed
   social network size and bridging potentials as indicators of social
   relationships. Social network size is a quantitative measure of the size
   of social relationships, and bridging potential is a qualitative
   indicator of the diversity and independence of these relationships.
   Multivariate regression analysis controlling for confounding factors was
   performed to evaluate associations between social relationships and
   insomnia symptoms.
   Results: Smaller social network size was significantly associated with
   sleep induction (adjusted odds ratio = 0.866, P = .015) and sleep
   maintenance (adjusted odds ratio = 0.862, P =.015) difficulties, but
   only in men. Poor bridging potential was also associated with sleep
   induction (adjusted odds ratio = 0.321, P = .024) and maintenance
   (adjusted odds ratio = 0.305, P = .031) difficulties only in men. For
   women, social relationship variables were not significantly associated
   with insomnia symptoms.
   Conclusions: The association between insomnia symptoms and social
   relationships varied by sex, as noted by statistical analyses accounting
   for covariates affecting insomnia symptoms. These results suggest that
   qualitative assessments of social relationship variables should be
   considered in clinical practice, since these variables can be
   interpreted differently for men and women.}},

Title = {{Structural characterization of the Extended Frontal Aslant Tract
   trajectory: A ML-validated laterality study in 3T and 7T}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{222}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The Extended Frontal Aslant Tract (exFAT) is a recently described
   tractography-based extension of the Frontal Aslant Tract connecting
   Broca's territory to both supplementary and pre-supplementary motor
   areas, and more anterior prefrontal regions. In this study, we aim to
   characterize the microstructural properties of the exFAT trajectories as
   a means to perform a laterality analysis to detect interhemispheric
   structural differences along the tracts using the Human Connectome
   Project (HCP) dataset. To that end, the bilateral exFAT was
   reconstructed for 3T and 7T HCP acquisitions in 120 randomly selected
   subjects. As a complementary exploration of the exFAT anatomy, we
   performed a white matter dissection of the exFAT trajectory of two
   ex-vivo left hemispheres that provide a qualitative assessment of the
   tract profiles. We assessed the lateralization structural differences in
   the exFAT by performing: (i) a laterality comparison between the mean
   microstructural diffusion-derived parameters for the exFAT trajectories,
   (ii) a laterality comparison between the tract profiles obtained by
   applying the Automated Fiber Quantification (AFQ) algorithm, and (iii) a
   cross-validated Machine Learning (ML) classifier analysis using single
   and combined tract profiles parameters for single-subject
   classification. The mean microstructural diffusion-derived parameter
   comparison showed statistically significant differences in mean FA
   values between left and right exFATs in the 3T sample. The diffusion
   parameters studied with the AFQ technique suggest that the inferiormost
   half of the exFAT trajectory has a hemispheric-dependent fingerprint of
   microstructural properties, with an increased measure of tissue
   hindrance in the orthogonal plane and a decreased measure of
   orientational dispersion along the main tract direction in the left
   exFAT compared to the right exFAT. The classification accuracy of the ML
   models showed a high agreement with the magnitude of those differences.}},

Title = {{Protons and High-Linear Energy Transfer Radiation Induce Genetically
   Similar Lymphomas With High Penetrance in a Mouse Model of the Aging

Abstract = {{Purpose: Humans are exposed to charged particles in different scenarios.
   The use of protons and high-linear energy transfer (LET) in cancer
   treatment is steadily growing. In outer space, astronauts will be
   exposed to a mixed radiation field composed of both protons and heavy
   ions, in particularly the long-term space missions outside of earth's
   magnetosphere. Thus, understanding the radiobiology and transforming
   potential of these types of ionizing radiation are of paramount
   importance.
   Methods and Materials: We examined the effect of 10 or 100 cGy of
   whole-body doses of protons or Si-28 ions on the hematopoietic system of
   a genetic model of aging based on recent studies that showed selective
   loss of the MLH1 protein in human hematopoietic stems with age.
   Results: We found that Mlh1 deficient animals are highly prone to
   develop lymphomas when exposed to either low doses of protons or Si-28
   ions. The lymphomas that develop are genetically indistinguishable, in
   spite of different types of damage elicited by low-and high-LET
   radiation. RNA sequencing analyses reveal similar gene expression
   patterns, similar numbers of altered genes, similar numbers of single
   nucleotide variants and insertions and deletions, and similar activation
   of known leukemogenic loci.
   Conclusions: Although the incidence of malignancy is related to
   radiation quality, and increased due to loss of Mlh1, the phenotype of
   the tumors is independent of LET. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Thiopurine (TP) treatment is discontinued in up to 30\% of patients
   suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) due to various adverse
   effects. Therapeutic drug monitoring of biologically active TP
   metabolites, i.e. thiopurine nucleotides (TPN), can help to optimize the
   efficacy and safety of the TP treatment. In our work, a novel strategy
   for TPN profiling, based on a porous graphitic carbon (PGC)
   chromatography, was developed. The validated PGC-MS method was compared
   with ion-exchange LCMS, a currently leading analytical approach
   established for the determination of TPN. The innovative approach
   enabled an enhancement of several key performance parameters demanded in
   a clinical routine use, namely (i) selectivity (timeand mass-recognition
   of all 12 TPN in one run), (ii) sensitivity (2-5-fold increase in
   intensities of the analytical signals), (iii) sample throughput (25\%
   shorter analysis time). Application of the novel TPN profiling strategy
   to a pilot clinical study (12 patients) revealed significantly higher
   levels of 6-methylthioguanine 5'-diphosphate (MeTGDP) in non-responsive
   IDB patients treated with azathioprine. Some other TPN are very close to
   the critical level (p = 0.05) and they will need larger groups of IBD
   patients to confirm definitively their relevance. In conclusion, the
   developed PGC-MS method represents a significant improvement to
   currently available methods for detailed profiling of TPN and its use in
   bigger clinical studies should lead to a better understanding of the
   relationship between TPN profiles and therapeutic outcome. (c) 2020

Title = {{TTG generation by fluid-fluxed crustal melting: Direct evidence from the
   Proterozoic Georgetown Inlier, NE Australia}},
Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{550}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Across the Archaean to Proterozoic transition, the composition of
   newly-formed felsic continental crust changed from
   tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) to calc-alkaline granitoid,
   possibly coinciding with the emergence of plate tectonics. Nevertheless,
   TTG suites were sporadically produced in Proterozoic and Phanerozoic
   orogenic belts, and such occurrences may provide petrological and
   tectonic insights into the formation of ancient continents. Here we
   demonstrate that the ca 1560 Ma Forest Home TTG plutonic suite in the
   Georgetown Inlier, NE Australia, was derived from partial melting of
   spatially-associated mafic rocks in a post-collisional setting. The
   studied TTG rocks have a `high-pressure' geochemical signature, with
   elevated Sr, low heavy rare earth element and low high field strength
   element contents. Established petrogenetic models suggest they were
   derived by partial melting either of hydrated basaltic crust at >70 km
   depth or enriched lithospheric mantle, or by fractionation of
   lower-pressure mafic magmas. Using phase equilibrium calculations and
   trace-element modelling, we show that the geochemical signature of the
   Georgetown TTG likely resulted from fluid-fluxed crustal melting at
   relatively shallow depths (25-35 km), consistent with field observations
   and the inferred metamorphic evolution of the inlier. Our results
   suggest that the chemical variability of TTGs can reflect the variable
   availability of fluids rather than depth of melting, which has
   implications for tectonic processes responsible for the formation of
   early continental crust. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Monograph Enhanced reduction of hexavalent chromium by hydrogen sulfide
   in frozen solution}},
Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{251}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Significant enrichment of hexavalent chromium {[}Cr (VI)] has been
   detrimentally influenced both environment and human's health in the
   polar regions. We found that reduction of Cr (VI) by hydrogen sulfide
   (H2S) was significantly enhanced in ice (-20 degrees C) but relatively
   slow in water (25 degrees C) under the same experimental conditions.
   This enhancement is ascribed to the freeze concentrations of Cr (VI),
   H2S, and proton (H+) in ice grain boundaries during freezing. Sulfate
   (SO42-) was produced more appreciably in ice than in water. Cr (VI)
   reduction in ice was enhanced effectively under various H2S
   concentrations (5.0-100 mu M), pHi (2.0-7.7), and increasing the
   freezing temperature from -30 to -15 degrees C. Optical and chemical
   observations with a confocal Raman microscope under frozen state
   supported the freeze concentration of Cr (VI) in ice grain boundaries.
   The accumulation of H+ (pH decrease) in ice grain boundaries was
   verified with the UV-visible absorption spectra of cresol red (CR) in
   ice. Removal of Cr (VI) in electroplating wastewater was significant and
   comparable to that in distilled water by freezing. Therefore, Cr (VI)
   reduction by H2S in ice phase indicates the occurrence of Cr (VI)
   removal in cold regions.}},

Title = {{Documenting capacity and cyclic stability enhancements in synthetic
   graphite potassium-ion battery anode material modified by low-energy
   liquid phase ball milling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{476}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Graphite is the most promising anode material for potassium-ion
   batteries due to the attractive theoretical capacity of 278 mAh
   g(-1)-and its low potential operation with respect to a potassium
   reference electrode. However, it is reported that its practically
   achievable capacities and cyclic stabilities are often relatively poor,
   which may impact the practical application of graphite in this new type
   of batteries. The recent results indicate that mechanical milling can be
   a possible modification method for graphitic materials to improve their
   electrochemical behaviors. In this work, we document the effects of
   liquid-phase ball milling conducted under low-energy conditions on the
   capacity levels and cyclic stability of the commercially available
   synthetic graphite. The obtained thin graphite flakes with high surface
   area lead to a much improved electrochemical performance of the
   electrodes with high reversible capacity of 227 mAh g(-1)- after 500
   cycles at 100 mA g(-1)-(capacity decay as slow as 0.0043\% per cycle and
   a capacity retention of similar to 98\%) and de-potassiation capacity of
   226 mAh g(-1)- at 4 A g(-1) current. This study demonstrates the
   possibility of capacity and cyclic stability enhancement in graphitic
   materials by mechanical milling under appropriately selected milling
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Noise is present in nature, and it affects the nervous and
   cardiovascular system. Noise added to stimuli may change the performance
   of excitable cells. In this paper, we study the effect of noise on the
   two main heart cell types: pacemaker and myocardial cells. This study
   investigates whether noise can induce changes in calcium dynamics on the
   two main heart cell types: pacemaker and myocardial cells, when stimuli
   with periodic electrical signals are disturbed by Gaussian white noise.
   Calcium dynamic parameters were obtained using imaging signals. Our
   results show that low intensities of noise favor amplitude and raise
   rate calcium dynamics, although our results show that the pacemaker
   cells are not affected by a noisy stimulus. Altogether, these findings
   suggest that noise plays a key role in calcium dynamics.}},

Title = {{Preparation and characterization of phosphate-stabilized amorphous
   calcium carbonate nanoparticles and their application in curcumin
   delivery}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{255}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Nano-sized amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) have a great potential for
   drug transport and drug delivery because of their high drug loading
   capacity, excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, ACC
   is the thermodynamically least stable phase of calcium carbonate, and
   such thermal metastability often transforms it into more stable vaterite
   or calcite phases, so the inhibition of the phase transformation of ACC
   is of great significance for its application in drug delivery systems.
   Herein, phosphate as a morphology controlling additive was introduced to
   stabilize the metastable ACC. The results showed that the composite
   nanoparticles (named here the ACCP) with narrow size distribution
   located at approximately 128 nm (measured by dynamic light scattering)
   were obtained, when Ca2+ concentration and C/P were 10 mM and 7/3
   respectively, prepared at 30 degrees C for 10 mM. The powdered X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) results showed that phosphate has an excellent ability
   to stabilize ACC, and even after storage for 60 days at mom temperature,
   the structure of ACCP remains amorphous. The in vitro drug release tests
   showed that ACCP nanoparticles had a high curcumin (Cur) loading
   capacity and a sustained drug release property. Moreover, the 1,
   1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) radical scavenging activity
   assay showed that ACCP-encapsulating strategy could effectively prevent
   the decomposition of Cur. In vitro cytotoxicity tests demonstrated that
   the resultants have excellent biocompatibility. Therefore, the
   as-prepared ACCP nanoparticles are promising for drug delivery
   applications.}},

   large deformation of SMPCs and the intrinsic electrical properties.
   SMPCs and EP-SMPs can withstand a high voltage to some extent. The
   addition of CF and GF fabric improved the mechanical properties of the

Title = {{Modeling of SO3 formation and depletion processes in coal-fired boilers}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{280}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Theoretical model developed for the SO3 formation and depletion
   processes in the region upstream of the economizer exit duct in
   coal-fired boilers. The model accounts for homogeneous conversion of
   SO(2)to SO3 as a result of gas phase reactions, SO3 catalytic formation
   due to Fe2O3 in the fly ash both in suspension and as deposits on boiler
   tubes, and SO3 depletion due to reaction with alkali compounds in the
   fly ash. Comparisons were made between model results and SO3 filed
   measurements for three boilers. There was good consistency between model
   results and experimental data up to the economizer section. However,
   within the economizers, the predicted SO3 levels were overestimated by
   the model. This was found to be as a result of additional SO3 depletion.
   Laboratory experiments were conducted to measure rates of SO3 and H2SO4
   conversion and reactions with CaO, and results were used for kinetics
   development, especially SO3 depletion prediction at low temperatures.
   Further refinement was implemented to the model to consider the effect
   of this SO3 depletion based on experimental results from a lab scale set
   up. Operational recommendations are introduced to mitigate SO3
   production, including reducing economizer O-2, increasing the frequency
   of sootblowing of the high temperature heat exchangers, and fire coals
   with low iron content. This study provides a fundamental understanding
   of the mechanisms that are most important to net SO3 formation
   (generation minus reduction) in coal-fired boilers. Such understanding
   will make it possible to develop cost-effective methods for reduction of
   SO3 formation in coal-fired boilers.}},

Abstract = {{Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) incorporated with a large number
   of luminophores are used as an important trend which increases the
   efficiency of solar cells by concentrating solar energy onto

   from the incomplete utilization of the solar spectrum. Extending the
   spectral absorption from UV-Vis into near-infrared (NIR) by means of
   upconversion particles, reduces the transmission loss of sub-band-gap
   photons with improved energy alignment. In this study, a new

   more than 100 nm reduces reabsorption losses significantly.
   Photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield is measured to be 65\%. Under solar
   radiation, the optical features of N-GQDs as absorbers/emitters in
   polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is studied. Our results demonstrate that
   GQDs-LSC attached to a perovskite solar cell could enhance efficiency.
   The GQDs-LSCs reaches the power conversion efficiency (PCE) more than
   4.3 times of PMMA-PV devise. Although the use of N-GQDs hybrid in LSCs
   for its upconversion feature is at an initial research step, the results
   prove that it provides a promising way for low cost and nonhazardous
   solar energy.}},

Abstract = {{Novel technologies using the intermediate-frequency magnetic field
   (IF-MF) in living environments are becoming popular with the advance in
   electricity utilization. However, the biological effects induced by the
   highintensity and burst-type IF-MF exposure used in the wireless power
   transfer technologies for electric vehicles or medical devices, such as
   the magnetic stimulation techniques, are not well understood. Here, we
   developed an experimental platform using rats, that combined an 18 kHz,
   high-intensity (Max. 88 mT), Gaussian-shaped burst IF-MF exposure system
   with an in vivo extracellular recording system. In this paper, we aimed
   to report the qualitative differences in stimulus responses in the
   regions of the somatosensory cortex and peripheral nerve fibers that
   were induced by the IF-MF exposure to the rat spinal cord. We also
   report the modulation of the stimulus responses in the somatosensory
   cortex under anesthesia or waking states. Using this experimental
   platform, we succeeded in the detection of the motor evoked potentials
   or the neuronal activity in the somatosensory cortex that was induced by
   the IF-MF exposure to the spinal cord in rats. Compared to the state of
   anesthesia, the neuronal activities in the somatosensory cortex was
   enhanced during the waking state. On the other hand, these neuronal
   responses could not be confirmed by the IF-MF exposure-related coil
   sound only. Our experimental results indicated the basic knowledge of
   the biological responses and excitation mechanisms of the spinal cord
   stimulation by the IF-MF exposure.}},

Title = {{Transesterification of sunflower oil to biodiesel fuel utilizing a novel
   K2CO3/Talc catalyst: Process optimizations and kinetics investigations}},

Abstract = {{A novel efficient and cost-effective heterogeneous catalyst for the
   production of biodiesel from transesterification of sunflower oil was
   prepared through the impregnation of K2CO3 upon the Talc material. The
   physicochemical features of the catalyst were studied through several
   characterization analyses. The effect of the K2CO3 loading was
   investigated by comparing the catalytic activity of various prepared
   catalysts. Moreover, the effect of the calcination temperature upon the
   catalytic activity was examined. To maximize the yield of the produced
   biodiesel fuel, reaction variables such as the reaction time and
   temperature, catalyst concentration, and methanol: oil molar ratio were
   optimized. Additionally, the kinetics of the reaction was understudied.
   Results revealed that the catalyst with 40 wt.\% of K2CO3 calcined at
   823 K possessed the highest catalytic activity. That is the biodiesel
   production yield of 98.4 \%. Moreover, the kinetic parameters of the
   reaction rate constant of 0.01558 min(-1), E-act of 62.4 kJ/mol, and
   Eyring-Polanyi's Delta H and Delta S of 59.7 kJ/mol and -103.7 J/(mol
   K), respectively were obtained for this material. These were revealed
   under the optimum reaction condition of the catalyst reactor loading of
   4 wt.\% as well as the methanol: oil molar ratio of 6:1 operated at 338
   K. Furthermore, the optimized catalyst was demonstrated to successfully
   withstand the aforementioned optimum criteria up to five consecutive
   reaction cycles while experiencing a negligible loss of about 8\% of its
   activity.}},

   Atlantic Ridge)}},
Journal = {{LITHOS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{The Doldrums transform system offsets the Equatorial Mid Atlantic Ridge
   by similar to 630 km at 7-8 degrees N. This transform system consists of
   four intra-transform spreading centers (ITRs) bounded by five transform
   faults. The northern-most ITR is linked to the MAR axis by a similar to
   180 km-long transform. Here, during two R/V A. N. Strakhov expeditions
   (S06 and S09), mantle peridotites were dredged along the transverse and
   median ridge of the transform, across the western flank of the ITR
   valley. Residual harzburgites were mainly sampled along the northern
   Doldrums transform valley, whereas plagioclase-bearing peridotites
   showing evidence for melt-rock interaction characterize the ITR domain.
   Petrological and geochemical observations reinforced by geochemical
   modelling are used to define the behaviour of trace elements during melt
   extraction and melt-rock reaction in our rocks. Results suggest that
   residual peridotites derive from mantle rocks that have undergone a
   degree of partial melting up to 12\%, with melting likely starting at
   the transition of garnet-spinel stability fields, whereas peridotites
   which suffered melt-rock reactions have been divided into two types: (i)
   pl-impregnated peridotites, formed by migration of melts at high
   porosity and high melt-rock ratio; and (ii) refertilized peridotites,
   generated at reduced porosity, when small fractions of the same
   percolating melt crystallized clinopyroxene and minor plagioclase. We
   suggest that the refertilizing agent was a melt highly depleted in
   incompatible trace elements, in turn produced by an ultra-depleted
   mantle source. This mantle experienced previous degrees of melt
   extraction at the ridge axis, before being transposed laterally along
   the transform where it melted a second time during the opening of the
   intra-transform spreading segment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Metal-organic-framework-derived 3D crumpled carbon nanosheets with
   self-assembled CoxSy nanocatalysts as an interlayer for lithium-sulfur
   batteries}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{400}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets are promising interlayers for enhancing
   the electrical conductivity and hindering the lithium polysulfide (LPS)
   shuttling in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSB). However, their dense 2D
   nature limits the electrolyte infusion and lithium ion transport,
   thereby decreasing the rate performance. Herein, we demonstrate that
   three-dimensional (3D) crumpled carbon nanosheets (CCNSs) decorated with
   a few nanometers of cobalt heterostructures (CoxSy) that are based on a
   2D zeolitic imidazolate framework can improve both the LPS adsorption as
   well as the ion conduction of LSB interlayer. The method is simple and
   scalable; the 3D composites are fabricated by post-annealing of 2D metal
   organic frameworks, which are synthesized by a solution process at room
   temperature without surfactant. Interestingly, the assembly and polarity
   of cobalt heterostructures can be further manipulated by the annealing
   condition; this provides a scientific evidence for the nanostructural
   and compositional combination of polar compounds. Consequently,
   CoS/Co9S8@CCNS exhibits the best performance with a discharge capacity
   of 911 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C after 100 cycles (150\% more than commercial
   sulfur cell) and the long-term cyclability of 600 mA h g(-1) at 1C after
   500 cycles. This is attributed to efficient charge transfer as well as
   effective LPS adsorption and effective catalytic conversion; further,
   this is achieved by the synergetic effects of well-distributed polar
   compounds comprising few nanometers in size and optimal polarity on a
   highly conductive N-doped carbon nanosheet.}},

Abstract = {{Xylan extracted from neem sawdust gave 22.5\%, (w/w) yield. The
   extracted xylan was composed of xylose and glucuronic acid at a molar
   ratio of 8:1 and with a molecular mass, similar to 66 kDa. FTIR and NMR
   analyses indicated a backbone of xylan substituted with 4-O-methyl
   glucuronic acid at the O-2 position. FESEM analysis showed a highly
   porous and granular surface structure of xylan. A thermogravimetric
   study of xylan showed thermal denaturation at 271 degrees C. The
   hydrolysis of xylan by recombinant endo-beta-1,4-xylanase produced a
   mixture of xylooligosaccharides ranging from degree of polymerization
   2-7. Xylooligosaccharides inhibited cell growth of human colorectal
   cancer (HT-29) cells but did not affect the mouse fibroblast cells
   confirming its biocompatibility. Western blotting, DNA laddering and
   flow cytometric analysis displayed inhibition of HT-29 cells by
   xylooligosaccharides. FLICA staining and mitochondrial membrane
   potential analyses confirmed the activation of the intrinsic pathway of

Title = {{Plasmonic p-n heterojunction of Ag/Ag2S/Ag2MoO4 with enhanced Vis-NIR
   photocatalytic activity for purifying wastewater}},
Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{251}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The sensitivity of photocatalysts to visible (Vis) and near infrared
   (NIR) light has been attracting considerable attention owing to its high
   utilization efficiency of solar energy. Herein, we have successfully
   constructed Ag/Ag2S/Ag2MoO4 p-n heterojunctions by hydrothermal method,
   which displays obvious surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and wide
   photoabsorption range from Vis to NIR light (400-900 nm).
   Ag/Ag2S/Ag2MoO4 exhibits the weakest photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy
   and highest photocurrent intensity, indicating greater separation
   efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs compared with Ag/Ag2S
   and Ag/Ag2MoO4. Under the visible light irradiation, Ag/Ag2S/Ag2MoO4 can
   remove 99\% RhB, 100\% MB, 83\% TC and 77\% Cr(VI), higher than that of
   Ag/Ag2S or Ag/Ag2MoO4. Importantly, with 808 nm laser as light source,
   Ag/Ag2S/Ag2MoO4 shows excellent NIR-driven photocatalytic activity (62\%
   RhB, 58\% MB, 52\% TC and 50\% Cr(VI)), compared to Ag/Ag2S or
   Ag/Ag2MoO4. The excellent photocatalytic performance of Ag/Ag2S/Ag2MoO4
   under Vis or NIR light roots from high separation efficiency of
   photogenerated carriers derived from the construction of Ag/Ag2S/Ag2MoO4
   p-n heterojunctions. Additionally, Ag/Ag2(S)/Ag2MoO4 can be easily
   recycled with high stability. Therefore, Ag/Ag2S/Ag2MoO4 can be employed
   as efficient and recyclable Vis-NIR-driven photocatalyst for the
   purification of wastewater.}},

Title = {{A Multimodality Image Guided Precision Radiation Research Platform:
   Integrating X-ray, Bioluminescence, and Fluorescence Tomography With
   Radiation Therapy}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Small animal irradiation is crucial to the investigation of
   radiobiological mechanisms. The paradigm of clinical radiation therapy
   is trending toward high- precision, stereotactic treatment. However,
   translating this scheme to small animal irradiation is challenging owing
   to the lack of high-quality image guidance. To overcome this obstacle,
   we developed a multimodality image guided precision radiation platform.
   Methods and Materials: The platform consists of 4 modules: x-ray
   computed tomography (CT), bioluminescence tomography (BLT), fluorescence
   molecular tomography (FMT), and radiation therapy. CT provides animal
   anatomy and material density for radiation dose calculation, as well as
   body contour for BLT and FMT reconstruction. BLT and FMT provide tumor
   localization to guide radiation beams and molecular activity to evaluate
   treatment outcome. Furthermore, we developed a Monte Carlo-based
   treatment planning system (TPS) for 3-dimensional dose calculation,
   calibrated it using radiochromic films sandwiched in a water-equivalent
   phantom, and validated it using in vivo dosimeters surgically implanted
   into euthanized mice (n = 4). Finally, we performed image guided
   irradiation on mice bearing orthotopic breast and prostate tumors and
   confirmed radiation delivery using gamma H2AX histology.
   Results: The Monte Carlo-based TPS was successfully calibrated by
   benchmarking simulation dose against film measurement. For in vivo
   dosimetry measured in the euthanized mice, the average difference
   between the TPS calculated dose and measured dose was 3.86\% +/- 1.12\%.
   Following the TPS-generated treatment plan, we successfully delivered 20
   Gy dose to an animal bearing an orthotopic prostate tumor using 4
   BLT-guided radiation beams and 5 Gy dose to an animal bearing an
   orthotopic breast tumor using a single FMT-guided radiation beam. gamma
   H2AX histology presented significantly more DNA damage in irradiated
   tumors and thus validated the dose delivery accuracy.
   Conclusions: Combined with Monte Carlo TPS, this multimodality
   CT/BLT/FMT image guided small animal radiation platform can specifically
   localize tumors, accurately calculate dose distribution, precisely guide
   radiation delivery, and molecularly evaluate treatment response. It
   provides an advanced toolset for radiobiology and translational cancer
   research. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Impact of ionic-electromagnetic field interaction on Maxwell-Wagner
   polarization in porous medium}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{318}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The brine composition of porous media and its effect on the polarization
   properties of the sandstone reservoir is important for understanding the
   mechanism of oil detachment from the grain surfaces and its movement
   through the reservoir channel. The mechanisms by which aqueous ions
   interact with the reservoir minerals via interfacial, ionic, dipolar and
   electronic polarization has been the subject of many researches.
   Moreover, the differential effects of cations and anions (polarization
   mechanisms) on fluid mobility under the influence of EM field are not
   been fully elucidated. Also, the complexity of reservoir response with
   the presence of oil and saline water to electromagnetic wave is not well
   understood. This study employs the wide frequency window polarization
   model to determine the influence of the concentration of adsorbed ions
   on reservoir rock properties. Berea sandstone was saturated with crude
   oil and different concentrations of NaCl solutions (3000, 5000, 7000,
   9000 and 11,000 ppm). The result reveals that at 11000 ppm, we have a
   strong wavelength shift with 6.8 nm at 11.2 GHz for Ionic and 6.1 nm at
   11.8 GHz for electronic polarization. It was deduced that Impedance is
   frequency dependent, which indicates a positive effect of
   electromagnetic field interaction on oil mobility. The increased in
   concentration of the electrolyte (NaCl), the polarization in the diffuse
   layer is stronger than that of stem layers due to better ionic
   distribution, as well as the van der Waals and intramolecular forces of
   attraction contribute to more adsorption energy in the porous media. The
   additional negative ions enable better dispersion due to relaxation,
   resulting from dielectric polarization and electrophoretic mobility with
   frequency. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   characteristics of low temperature combustion (PCCI and RCCI) modes}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a comparative investigation of engine combustion,
   performance and emission characteristics of low temperature combustion
   modes namely premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) and reactivity
   controlled compression ignition (RCCI) with conventional compression
   ignition (CI) combustion mode was performed. Experiments were performed
   in a single cylinder research engine at constant engine speed (1500 rpm)
   and at four different engine loads (1, 2, 3 and 4 bar brake mean
   effective pressure (BMEP)). Baseline CI and PCCI mode combustion
   experiments were performed using mineral diesel as test fuel; while
   mineral diesel-methanol fuel pair was used as high-reactivity fuel (HRF)
   and low-reactivity fuel (LRF) respectively in RCCI mode combustion.
   Results showed that RCCI mode combustion was relatively more stable
   compared to baseline CI and PCCI combustion modes. At higher engine
   loads, RCCI mode combustion exhibited relatively lower knocking and
   combustion noise than other combustion modes. Performance
   characteristics showed that brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of RCCI mode
   combustion was comparable to baseline CI mode combustion, however, at
   higher engine loads, RCCI mode combustion resulted in relatively higher
   BTE compared to both baseline CI and PCCI combustion modes.
   Significantly lower EGT of RCCI mode combustion compared to baseline CI
   as well as PCCI combustion modes was another important finding of this
   study. Emission results showed that RCCI mode combustion emitted
   relatively lower oxides of nitrogen (NOx), but significantly higher
   hydrocarbons (HC) compared to baseline CI and PCCI combustion modes. A
   NOx-BTE trade-off analysis was also carried out, which demonstrated the
   suitability of RCCI mode combustion at all engine loads. Finally, a
   parametric analysis was carried out to compare the critical parameters
   of baseline CI, PCCI, and RCCI combustion modes at low and high engine
   loads, which exhibited improved engine performance and emission
   characteristics of low temperature combustion (LTC) modes, especially
   the RCCI mode combustion.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the potential of juliflora oil for bio-based
   lubricant applications and it was chemically modified by a two-step
   trans esterification process with further treatment with
   trimethylolpropane. After the chemical modification process, TiO2
   nanoparticles were added to the oil. The lubricants were examined for
   properties like kinematic viscosity, viscosity index, flash point, and
   iodine value. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used for the
   examination of the worn surfaces. The kinematic viscosity of the oil
   shows increment with chemical modification and during the addition of
   the nanoparticles. The maximum increment was observed with a 1.2\%
   addition of nanoparticles. The flash point increases with the addition
   of the nanoparticles and the maximum value was attained at 0.6\%
   concentration. During the tribological analysis, 0.6\% concentration of
   TiO2 nanoparticles demonstrated a reduction in the coefficient of
   friction (COF) and wear of the pin. The SEM images also show better
   surfaces when the nanoparticles were added up to 0.6\% concentration
   which was due to effective lubrication to the surface. The optimum
   nanoparticle addition was found at 0.6\% concentration to the chemically

Abstract = {{The crystallographic and magnetic properties of the polycrystalline
   intermetallic compound Dy2AgIn3 are presented. The compound crystallizes
   in the hexagonal CaIn2- type structure (space groupP6(3)/mmc). The
   magnetic susceptibility data reveals a Curie-Weiss (CW) law behavior

   +/- 0.29 mu(B)/Dy(3+)and a Curie paramagnetic temperature theta(p) =

   exhibits a Griffith's phase like behavior. The dc field cooled (FC) and
   zero field cooled (ZFC) susceptibility, show field dependent
   irreversible phenomena belowT(r) similar to 43 K, and the ZFC plots
   present a cusp glass like maxima at31 K. The irreversibility

   the formation of cluster spin-glass states (CSG). At low angles the

   antiferromagnetic (AFM) origin which is triggered by the similar to 5
   nm- magnetic spin clusters.}},

   Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging}},
Journal = {{ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{609}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is one of the biomarkers most commonly
   used to determine tumor activity. In this work, a Surface Plasmon
   Resonance imaging (SPRi) immunosensor was developed. The immunosensor
   consists of a cysteamine linker attached to a gold chip and mouse
   monoclonal anti-CEA antibody bonded by the ``EDC/NHS protocol{''}. The
   formation of successive immunosensor layers was confirmed by AFM
   measurements. The concentration of the antibody was optimized. The
   linear response range of the developed immunosensor is between 0.40 and
   20 ng mL(-1), and it is suitable for CEA measurement in both blood
   cancer patients and healthy individuals. Only 3 mu L of serum or plasma
   sample is required, and no preconcentration is used. The method has a
   precision of 2-16\%, a recovery of 101-104\% depending on CEA
   concentration, a detection limit of 0.12 ng mL(-1) and a quantification
   limit of 0.40 ng mL(-1). The method is selective (with respect to
   albumin, leptin, interleukin 6, metallopmteinase-1, metallopeptidase
   inhibitor 1 and CA 125/MUC16) and it was validated by comparison with
   the standard electrochemiluminescence method on a series of colorectal
   cancer blood samples.}},

Title = {{Catalytic decomposition of toxic phosphine gas on the developed nickel
   ferrite nanocrystals supported by Halloysite nanotubes}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{530}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) nanocatalysts with trace metal nickel (Ni-0) as
   the reaction trigger were dispersedly supported by halloysite nanotubes
   (HNTs) to decompose toxic phosphine (PH3) into yellow phosphorus and
   hydrogen. The mixed spinel catalyst greatly reduced the temperature to
   400 degrees C for 99\% conversion and underwent no obvious deactivation
   after 2 h compared with magnetite. The as-synthesized and spent
   catalysts were characterized by Transmission electron microscope, X-ray
   powder diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In combination
   with density functional theory calculations, the PH3 decomposition
   mechanism on Ni-0@NiFe2O4/HNTs was proposed. The original plated Ni-0
   triggers the reaction to form active H radicals ({[}(sic)H])
   contributing to the reduction of octahedral Ni(II) in NiFe2O4, and the
   newly generated Ni-0 determines the catalytic activity and stability. In
   addition, the formation of Ni2P is crucial to developing the stable
   elemental phosphorus (P) layer as the mainly active intermediate for PH3
   successive decomposition into P-4, since P layer reduces the activation
   barrier of PH3 decomposition. Particularly, the mixed crystal spinel
   with specific coordination (with octahedral coordinated Fe(II) and
   tetrahedral coordinated defects) facilitates the electron transfer among
   the active species to recycle the catalytic reaction. This work provides
   a promising approach for PH3 air-pollution control and P recovery from
   the industrial off-gas.}},

Title = {{Enhancement of lens extraction-induced MCP-1 upregulation and microglia
   response in long-term diabetes via c-jun, stat1 and ERK}},
Journal = {{LIFE SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{261}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Diabetic patients are reported to have a higher incidence of
   cataract surgery-induced retinal complications, possibly due to retinal
   inflammation. Our goal is to identify the key inflammatory cytokines,
   cells and regulatory pathways involved.
   Main methods: Diabetes mellitus (DM) induced by streptozotocin and
   control mice received extracapsular lens extraction (ECLE) in one eye.
   Neuroretinas were collected at postoperative dayl (P1), day2(P2), and
   day7(P7). BV2 cells were harvested under the treatment of high glucose,
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and inhibitors. The method of qPCR, western
   blot and immunohistochemistry were used to identify the expression of
   cytokines and signaling pathways.
   Key findings: ECLE induced increased inflammation in the neuroretina of
   surgery eye with a peak at P1. MCP-1 surge in long-term diabetes
   mellitus (LDM) mice at P1 is higher than short-term diabetes mellitus
   (SDM) mice and normal mice. Significant activation of c-jun and c-fos
   were found in LDM compared to normal and SDM. Advanced activation of
   statl and ERK was found at P1 in LDM instead of at P2 in SDM and Normal.
   Activation of microglia/macrophage was also detected in the LDM mice.
   Besides the inhibition of c-jun/JNK, MCP-1 expression can be attenuated
   by inhibiting stat1 and ERK under high glucose condition after LPS
   stimulation.
   Significance: Enhancement of lens extraction-induced MCP-1 upregulation
   and microglia response in long-term diabetes might be due to the
   activation of cjun, stat1 and ERK, which provided potential therapeutic
   targets to attenuate retinal inflammation after surgery in diabetic
   individuals.}},

Title = {{A splitting algorithm for LWR traffic models with flux discontinuous in
   the unknown}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{421}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{We propose a finite difference algorithm for a scalar conservation law
   associated with the Lighthill-Witham-Richards model of traffic flow for
   the case where the flux is discontinuous with respect to the unknown.
   Specifically, the flux has a single decreasing jump, which models a
   transition from free to congested traffic flow. We write the flux as a
   Lipschitz continuous flux plus a Heaviside flux, and then construct a
   splitting based on this decomposition. The portion of the scheme
   associated with the Heaviside flux is implicit, but does not require the
   iterative solution of a system of nonlinear equations. The portion
   associated with the continuous flux is a standard Godunov scheme. The
   scheme does not employ a flux regularization, nor a Riemann solver for
   the discontinuous flux problem. Standard hyperbolic time steps are
   allowed, i.e., the time steps are dictated by the CFL condition
   associated with the continuous portion of the flux. We prove that the
   approximate solutions converge, up to extraction of a subsequence, to a
   weak solution of the conservation law. We propose a shock admissibility
   criterion, and present some numerical examples. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Effective treatment of wastewaters laden with heavy metals is critical
   to the sustainable social and economic growth of metal recycling
   villages in Vietnam. Currently, most wastewaters from metal recycling
   villages in Vietnam are directly discharged, posing great threats to the
   environment and human health. In this study, a small-scale combined
   coagulation-membrane filtration treatment of wastewater collected from a
   metal recycling village in Vietnam was experimentally investigated. The
   experimental results manifested the technical viability of the combined
   coagulation-membrane filtration process for the treatment of the heavily
   polluted metal recycling wastewater for beneficial reuse. In this
   combined treatment process, coagulation using ferric chloride (FeCl2)
   served as a pre-treatment prior to the microfiltration (MF)/reverse
   osmosis (RO) process. Under the optimised conditions, coagulation at the
   dosage of 0.2 g FeCl2 per 1,000 ml wastewater removed more than 90\% of
   heavy metals (i.e. most notably including aluminium and chromium) from
   the wastewater, reducing the aluminium and chromium concentrations in
   the wastewater from 548.0 to 52.3 mg/L to 32.6 and 1.7 mg/L,
   respectively. The MF treatment of the wastewater following the
   coagulation further removed suspended solids and organic matters,
   rendering the wastewater safe for the subsequent RO filtration with
   respect to membrane fouling. Given the efficient pre-treatment of
   coagulation and MF, the RO process at the controlled water recovery of
   50\% was able to effectively treat the wastewater to potable water.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, MMC materials were produced by stir casting method using
   AA7075 alloy matrix and silicon carbide (SiC) as reinforcement elements
   in order to investigate the effect of die-sinking electric discharge
   machining (EDM) process parameters for various weight percentage
   reinforcement (10\% 14\% and 18\%) used MMC. EDM with three different
   pulse-on time (Time on) (25, 50 \&75 mu s) and discharge current value
   (2, 4 \& 6 Amperes) and at constant dwell time (20 mu s) and depth of
   cut (0.5 mm). After machining process, the effects of process parameters
   on processing time, average surface roughness, hole diameter and the
   weight loss were investigated. As a result of the study, highest values,
   the lowest values of processing time, hole diameter and average surface
   roughness were obtained for various weight percentage reinforcement MMC
   respectively. Ideal MMC, discharge current value and time-on duration
   for average surface roughness, hole diameter, processing time and
   material wear loss according to signal to noise ratio were determined.
   According to ANOVA results, R-2 values for the average surface
   roughness, hole diameter, processing time and material wear loss were
   calculated as 89.55\%, 98.46\%, 89.85\% and 24.06\% respectively.}},

   dyes using magnetic-MOF: Experimental and DFT study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{318}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{La-MOF-NH2@Fe3O4 (magnetic-MOF) was used as an efficient, ultrafast, and
   selective adsorbent for the separation of Congo Red (CR) with 92.02\%
   removal after 2 min. The magnetic-MOF was identified by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, Zeta Potential analysis,
   analysis of the magnetic hysteresis, Fourier-transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Kinetics, isotherms, the
   effect of pH. thermodynamic, and selectivity of CR adsorption were
   investigated. The results confirmed that the adsorption kinetics
   complied with the pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption isotherms
   were interpreted by the Langmuir isotherm model, indicating that the dye
   was adsorbed homogeneously on the surface of the magnetic-MOI (monolayer
   adsorption). Investigating the effect of pH changes on adsorption
   demonstrated that this magnetic-MOF has 99.2\% removal efficiency at 2
   pH after 2 min. The adsorption results at different temperatures
   suggested spontaneous and endothermic adsorption. Selective adsorption
   of CR was investigated in the presence of anionic dyes (Methyl Orange
   (MO) Sunset Yellow (SY) and Fluorescein (F)), and cationic dyes
   (Rhodamine B (RB), Safranin (SF) and Methylene Blue (MB)), which
   demonstrated that magnetic-MOF was appropriate for the selective
   separation of CR. The molecular chemical reactivity of the dye molecules
   was studied using electrophilicity index (omega), chemical potential
   (mu), and chemical hardness (eta) based on HOMO and LUMO energy by DFT
   calculations. DFT calculations proved that CR was more reactive than
   anionic and cationic dyes. Additionally, electrostatic potential (ESP)
   analysis revealed that there are active sites on the CR. Thus, CR can
   have stronger electrostatic and host-gust interactions with
   magnetic-MOF. Reusability study revealed that this magnetic-MOF is
   appropriate for industry application because REX was greater than 90\%
   after five consecutive uses. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The uptime of utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants is of
   utmost importance for meeting contractual energy yields and expected
   capacity factors. Aerial Infrared Thermography (aIRT) is a
   non-destructive, no downtime, fast and cost-effective method for
   monitoring large-scale PV power plants and assisting in fault detection.
   The use of aIRT techniques aims at increasing the quality and service
   life of PV plants especially in sunny and developing countries such as
   Brazil, where there is a shortfall of specialised workforce and the
   costs for a detailed supervisory system of utility-scale PV power plants
   are high. This paper presents an analysis of an aIRT flight campaign
   over four utility-scale PV plants in the northeast of Brazil. Two types
   of measurement equipment have been tested and compared, resulting in
   more stability and efficiency using a commercially available solution.
   This solution was also equipped with a RGB camera that accelerated the
   inspections, since it helped to differentiate defects from hot spots
   caused by soiling and vegetation over the modules, which were common.
   Different methods for fault detection were also tested and it was
   concluded that post-flight image analysis provides faster results. The
   most common faults that can happen in the early operation of PV power
   plants and how operators should address and prevent them were also
   discussed. The most common defect detected during the campaign were
   disconnected cell substrings. However, disconnected strings had the most
   impact on the power plants energy performance.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Urothelial carcinoma arising in a bladder diverticulum
   (UCBD) is uncommon, and data on treatment and outcome are sparse.
   Objective: To analyze clinicopathological characteristics of UCBD and to
   compare outcome after radical cystectomy (RC) and partial cystectomy
   (PC).
   Design, setting, and participants: Data of 115 UCBD patients treated
   with RC (n = 81) or PC (n = 34) between 2000 and 2016 were collected
   from 11 institutional databases and were analyzed retrospectively.
   Median follow-up was 5.0 yr (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 4.0-6.2).
   Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Upstaging of tumor stage
   at diagnostic transurethral resection (TUR) to the RC/PC specimen was
   investigated. Overall survival (OS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS)
   after RC and PC were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and compared
   using the log-rank test. Intravesical recurrences after PC were
   reported. A multivariable Cox proportional-hazard model was used to
   identify factors associated with OS.
   Results and limitations: There were no statistically significant
   differences in clinicopathological characteristics between RC and PC
   groups. Fifty-five percent of patients with cTa/is/1 at diagnostic TUR
   had >= pT2 tumors at RC/PC. Five-year OS and MFS were, respectively,
   62\% and 66\% for RC and 66\% and 55\% for PC (p = 0.9 and p = 0.6).
   Intravesical tumor recurrence was seen in six of 34 (18\%) PC patients.
   In multivariable analysis, positive surgical margins and extravesical
   disease (>= pT2) were associated with worse OS, whereas treatment
   modality was not (RC: reference; PC: hazard ratio 0.94, {[}95\% CI:
   0.47-1.90], p = 0.9).
   Conclusions: Upstaging of UCBD was frequent, indicating an inaccuracy in
   clinical staging. We found no differences in OS or MFS between PC and RC
   groups; therefore, PC may represent a feasible surgical alternative to
   RC in selected UCBD patients. Patient summary: In this report, we looked
   at the treatment of urothelial carcinoma arising in a bladder
   diverticulum (UCBD). We found that bladder-sparing treatment by partial
   cystectomy may be an alternative to radical cystectomy in carefully
   selected UCBD patients. (C) 2018 European Association of Urology.

Abstract = {{The N-P flame retardant ammonium salt of hydroxyethyl
   hexahydrotristriazine-triphosphoric acid (AHTTPA) was prepared by a
   one-pot synthesis method under formaldehyde-free and solvent-free
   conditions. The AHTTPA was finished on the biomolecule of cotton by
   using the dip-roll-bake method. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR H-1,
   C-13, and P-31) demonstrated that AHTTPA was successfully synthesized.
   The flame retardancy of AHTTPA-treated cotton was studied by limiting
   oxygen index (LOI), vertical flaming test (VFT), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), and cone calorimetry (CC). The results from these
   tests indicate that AHTTPA-treated cotton exhibited favorable flame
   retardancy and durability (the LOI value of 40\%-treated cotton after 50
   laundering cycles (LCs) was 29.8\%), the flame was immediately
   extinguished after removal from the treated cotton, no smoldering or
   continued burning, the burned part formed a complete carbon frame and
   generally maintained its original morphology, the peak heat release rate
   (PHRR) and total heat release (THR) of AHTTPA-treated cotton fabric were
   significantly lower than pure cotton. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
   results showed that AHTTPA improved the thermal stability of cotton. The
   breaking strength and softness of AHTTPA-treated cotton was also
   retained. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   healing}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{400}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Wound repair is a dynamic and complex process that involves various
   interactions between repair cells, growth factors and the extracellular
   matrix. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a pivotal role in wound healing,
   including causing the contraction of wound surfaces, dilating blood
   vessels, participating in inflammation, and promoting collagen
   synthesis, angiogenesis, and fibroblast proliferation. Here, we prepared
   a novel keratin-based nitric oxide donor, called S-nitrosated keratin
   (KSNO). Then, KSNO was coelectrospun with polyurethane (PU) and gelatin
   (Gel) to produce PU/Gel/KSNO biocomposite mats. The prepared mats
   released NO without cytotoxicity, promoted the proliferation of L929
   murine fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs),
   and inhibited bacterial growth. These mats could also accelerate the
   cell adhesion and growth along the random arrangement of electrospun
   fibers, and simulate the structure of the natural extracellular matrix
   to provide good scaffolds for cell. The effect of PU/Gel/KSNO on
   promoting wound healing was investigated on a full-thickness excisional
   cutaneous wound model in rats. The results demonstrated that these mats
   accelerated wound healing without inflammatory reaction. In conclusion,
   PU/Gel/KSNO mats display excellent bioactivity and biocompatibility and
   have potential in the field of wound repair.}},

Abstract = {{A key goal in drug development is optimized dosing for patients.
   Interactions between drug developers and regulatory scientists
   throughout development are important for the optimization of dosing and
   serve as a forum to discuss approaches for optimal dosing, such as
   precision or individualized dosing. To date, there has not been a
   systematic assessment of the advice provided by the US Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA) to drug developers from an individualized dosing
   perspective. Here, we reviewed FDA recommendations on dose selection for
   efficacy trials at end-of-phase meetings between the FDA and drug
   developers for 76 new molecular entities approved between 2013 and 2017
   that are considered amenable for an individualized dosing method,
   response-guided titration. Forty FDA dosing recommendations were
   identified as specific to dose selection and design of the respective
   efficacy trials and subsequently: (i) characterized based on if they
   were supportive of individualized dosing and (ii) compared with dosing
   regimens used in efficacy trials and labeling at approval to evaluate if
   FDA recommendations were implemented. Of these 40 recommendations for
   efficacy trials, 35 (88\%) were considered supportive of individualized
   dosing. Eighteen of these 40 recommendations (45\%) were incorporated
   into efficacy trials and 11 (28\%) were incorporated into labeling. This
   research suggests that early FDA-sponsor interactions can support the
   study of doses in efficacy trials that may lead to individualized dosing
   strategies in labeling.}},

Title = {{Molecular engineering of anti-PD-L1 peptide and photosensitizer for
   immune checkpoint blockade photodynamic-immunotherapy}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{400}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) strategy based on suppressing
   programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway has
   been proved to be promising and effective in cancer immunotherapy.
   However, its potential risk of immune-related adverse events (irAEs)
   places stringent requirements on the precise loading of anti-PD-L1 agent
   in nanomedicine. Precise control of the loading content of anti-PD-L1
   antibody is a difficult task since physical encapsulation has inevitable
   drawbacks like batch-to-bath variation and chemical modification is
   limited by the low stability of the antibody. Herein, we proposed a
   molecular engineering strategy to develop the nanomedicine with precise
   control of anti-PD-L1 agent content by using anti-PD-L1 peptide (APP) as
   the substitute to anti-PD-L1 antibody. The APP was chemically bonded
   with a photosensitizer IR780 to obtain IR780-M-APP, a molecule able to
   self-assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) with a precise APP loading (48.4
   wt\%) determined by the molecular structure. Specifically, the IR780
   moiety in IR780-M-APP NPs endows the nanoparticles with photodynamic
   therapeutic effect as well as the ability to trigger immunogenic cell
   death (ICD), while the APP moiety can block the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway for
   promoting immunotherapy. The proposed photodynamic-immunotherapy
   nanoplatform not only killed primary tumors directly but also eradicated
   the metastatic and invasive tumors effectively. The present molecular
   engineering strategy combined with anti-PD-L1 peptide might provide more
   opportunities for the design of advanced nanoplatforms for cancer
   therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The Chinese oak silkworm, Antheraea pernyi, has not only been
   semi-domesticated as an important economical insect but also used for
   genetic research. The female moths of A. pernyi employ a pheromone blend
   containing (E,Z)-6,11-hexadecadienal (E6,Z11-16:Ald),
   (E,Z)-6,11-hexadecadienyl acetate (E6,Z11-16:OAc), and
   (E,Z)-4,9-tetradecadienyl acetate (E4,Z9-14:OAc). While its biosynthesis
   pathway is largely unknown. By deep sequencing and de novo assembly of
   sex pheromone gland (PG) transcriptome, we identified 141 candidate
   genes that are putatively related to pheromone biosynthesis,
   degradation, and chemoreception in A. pernyi. Gene expression patterns
   and phylogenetic analysis revealed that two desaturases (AperDES1 and
   2), two fatty acid reductase (AperFAR1 and 2), and three
   acetyltransferase genes (AperACT1, 2 and 3) showed PG-biased or specific
   expression and were phylogenetically related to genes known to be
   involved in pheromone synthesis in other species. Furthermore, two
   carboxylesterases (AperCOE6 and 11) and two chemosensory protein
   (AperCSP1 and 6) were also expressed specifically or predominantly in
   the PGs, which might be related to sex pheromone degradation and
   transportation, respectively. Based on these results, the sex pheromone
   biosynthesis and metabolic pathway was proposed in A. pernyi. This study
   provides some crucial candidates for further functional elucidation, and
   may be used for interfering sexual communication in other Saturniidae
   pests. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Damage identification of a single RC column subjected to barge impact
   based on optimization strategies}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{216}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The safety of civil structures e.g. bridges and frame buildings are
   threatened by various inevitable hazards such as corrosion, fatigue and
   extreme loading e.g. earthquake, blast, impact. Such hazards may cause
   significant damage to structures and hence reduce their performance.
   This paper proposes two different strategies, i.e. the direct
   identification method which assumes that the information of loading
   which causes damage to a structure is not known and the indirect
   identification method which assumes that the loading causing structural
   damage is known to be generated by certain scenarios e.g. impact to
   identify the damage of civil structures after certain loading processes.
   Barge impact upon a single reinforced concrete (RC) column is considered
   in this paper to assess the prediction quality of the proposed
   strategies by comparing the identified damage quantities to the
   benchmark output data generated by an exact deformation analysis using
   the previously developed coupled multi-degree-of-freedom model (CMM).
   The proposed strategies show great potential for practical applications
   to damage identification of civil structures.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Three kinds of sandwich beams were prepared, which were cross, double
   cross and square sandwich structure (CSS, DCSS and SSS), using spruce
   wood as face panels, KH-560 modified jute fabrics reinforced epoxy
   laminated composites (JFRELC) as cores. This research investigated the
   mechanism of micro-surface modification of composites, the bending
   behaviors and failure modes of sandwich structures. The results showed
   that the grafting of KH-560 on jute fabric improved the interfacial
   compatibility and mechanical properties of laminated composite. The
   stretching vibration peak of C-O-Si/Si-O-Si groups of the KH-560
   modified composites were found. The content of silicon in the modified
   composites was about 4 times of that in the unmodified composite. The
   flexural rigidity, shear rigidity, shear modulus and shear strength of
   SSS were 2.10 x 10(8) N.mm(2), 1.97 x 10(5) N, and 143.94 MPa, 0.948 MPa
   respectively, which were significantly better than that of DCSS and CSS.
   The load-mass ratio of short beam of DCSS was similar to the long beam
   of SSS. The failure modes of three grid sandwich structures included
   shear failure, general shear failure, indentation, panel fracture and
   separation between the core and panel. The failure mechanism of the
   shear failure cores contained fiber pulling out and fiber splitting.}},

Title = {{Biomass energy production and its impacts on the ecological footprint:
   An investigation of the G7 countries}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{743}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, the impacts of biomass energy consumption on the
   environment have attracted the attention of policymakers and scholars.
   Although empirical studies have been conducted on this topic, the
   relationship between biomass energy production and the ecological
   footprint has been overlooked in the literature. This study seeks to
   fill this gap by investigating the effects of biomass energy production
   on the ecological footprint of the G7 countries for the period
   1980-2016. For this purpose, we use a set of methods, that help overcome
   the problem of cross-sectional dependence in panel data analysis. The
   findings from dynamic seemingly unrelated regression (DSUR) estimation
   show that biomass energy production increases the ecological footprint
   of the G7 countries. Meanwhile, a Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test
   provides evidence that unidirectional causality runs from biomass energy
   production to the ecological footprint. Based on these empirical
   results, several policy recommendations are proposed for the G7
   countries. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A scalable two-dimensional moving electric lattice on a chip for polar
   molecules}},
Journal = {{OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{Cold atoms and polar molecules have long been candidates for the
   implementation of quantum information processing. Although many schemes
   of two-dimensional (2D) moving optical or magnetic lattices have been
   proposed for atomic shift register, little work has been done on 2D
   electric lattice for molecular shift register, mainly due to the
   complexity of molecular energy level structures as well as the challenge
   to build micropotentials that are scalable, smoothly moving and
   accurately controlled. Here we present a design of chipbased 2D electric
   lattice for molecular shift register capable of scaling and controlling,
   which mainly consists of arrays of equidistant gold electrodes for
   generating a moving electric lattice. Our theoretical analysis and
   trajectory calculations, based on the polar molecules ammonia-D3 (ND3)
   and methylidyne radical (CH), show explicitly that the 2D lattice is
   able to directly slow down arrays of polar molecules from supersonic
   speeds to a standstill over a distance of a few centimeters, and then
   hold them for a certain time or shift them back in a smooth manner.
   Besides, it also enables decelerating and trapping of the two molecular
   species simultaneously, which contributes to the understanding towards
   new phenomena such as novel quantum mechanical collisions and cold
   chemistry.}},

Title = {{Improved reinforcement learning with curriculum}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{158}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Humans tend to learn complex abstract concepts faster if examples are
   presented in a structured manner. For instance, when learning how to
   play a board game, usually one of the first concepts learned is how the
   game ends, i.e. the actions that lead to a terminal state (win, lose or
   draw). The advantage of learning endgames first is that once the actions
   leading to a terminal state are understood, it becomes possible to
   incrementally learn the consequences of actions that are further away
   from a terminal state - we call this an end-game-first curriculum. The
   state-of-the-art machine learning player for general board games,
   AlphaZero by Google DeepMind, does not employ a structured training
   curriculum. Whilst Deepmind's approach is effective, their method for
   generating experiences by self-play is resource intensive, costing
   literally millions of dollars in computational resources. We have
   developed a new method called the endgame-first training curriculum,
   which, when applied to the self-play/experience-generati on loop,
   reduces the required computational resources to achieve the same level
   of learning. Our approach improves performance by not generating
   experiences which are expected to be of low training value. The
   end-gamefirst curriculum enables significant savings in processing
   resources and is potentially applicable to other problems that can be
   framed in terms of a game. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{One-step synthesis and Gd3+ decoration of BiOBr microspheres consisting

   hydrocarbon fuel}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{400}},

Abstract = {{Rising carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmospheric environment is a
   key cause of global warming. To reduce the concentration of CO2 in the
   atmosphere, converting CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels is an eye-catching
   strategy. Herein, we achieve in-situ doping of Gd3+ for BiOBr
   microspheres consisting of nanosheets via a simple hydrothermal method.
   The resulting Gd doped BiOBr structure (BiOBr/Gd) exhibits considerable
   improvement on photocatalytic activities for CO2 reduction. Compared to
   bare BiOBr (24.097 mu mol g(-1) for 3 h), the BiOBr/Gd-0.05 displays
   excellent performance of CO2 photoreduction with nearly five-fold
   increase in the rate of methanol emission (123.711 mu mol g(-1) for 3
   h). The enhanced CO2 reduction activities of BiOBr/Gd-0.05 are
   attributed to the mechanism that Gd3+ ions are introduced into the
   lattice of BiOBr to broaden the visible light response. Furthermore, we
   discuss the mechanism of photocatalytic CO2 reduction, where holes are
   the main active species in the process of CO2 reduction.}},

Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{251}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Pharmaceuticals manufacture is of importance to human life and health.
   Great amount of pharmaceuticals crystallization residual liquor was
   produced in the pharmaceuticals manufacture, which lead to adverse
   influence on the green chemical engineering and environment. Herein, we
   proposed a multistage separation process based on nanofiltration
   technology to recover cefalexin crystallization residual liquor
   separation. The influence of membranes, pH value, concentration as well
   as separation stages on the separation performance was explored. The
   nanofiltration membrane (NF-200D) with strong electronegative charge
   showed a high rejection of 74.00\% for
   7-amino-3-desacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA) and low rejection of
   7.06\% for D-phenylglycine in mixed solution. The increase in the
   electronegative charge of NF membranes could enhance the repulsion
   between membrane and solute molecules. The separation factor of
   nanofiltration membrane for 7-ADCA and Dphenylglycine reached a peak
   value of 3.06 at pH 8.0 and concentration of 10 mmol L-1. Using three
   stage separation, the concentrated 7-ADCA (C7-ADCA = 23.12 g L-1) and
   the permeate D-phenylglycine (CD-phenylglycine = 0.19 g L-1) were
   obtained. Further improved separation sequence should focus on the
   preparation of nanofiltration membranes with strong electronegative
   charge and acid-base tolerance, and the nanofiltration process design
   with enhanced efficiency of separation process.}},

   -brain barrier}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{589}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Lipoproteins are naturally occurring nano sized transport vehicles in
   the human body. Therefore, lipoproteins could be applied as a drug
   carrier system. Additionally, several reports of apolipoprotein mediated
   blood-brain barrier (BBB) crossing suggest lipoprotein mimicking
   nanoparticles (NPs) as possible drug delivery vehicles to the brain.
   This could extend the therapy opportunities of various diseases of the
   central nervous system.
   A lipoprotein imitating NP system, consisting of a lecithin coated
   lipophilic cholesteryl oleate core with embedded fluorescent dye and
   adsorbed apolipoprotein E3 (ApoE) has been established using a two-step
   solvent injection method. Lecithin coating was proven to stabilize the
   NPs in isotonic saline solution and to bind ApoE in a highly efficient
   way. Fluorescent dye load (as model drug) and ApoE amount were varied,
   obtaining 100 nm sized, monodisperse NPs.
   The NPs' interaction with the BBB formed by primary porcine brain
   capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC) was investigated by fluorescence
   microscopy observing that ApoE mediated a lysosome bypassing uptake
   mechanism. Using this in vitro BBB model, ApoE concentration dependent
   permeation over the cell layer could be proven in both directions. An
   ApoE mediated transcytosis could be achieved, as it had been observed
   earlier for low-density lipoproteins.
   These results show that the newly developed NP system successfully
   mimics endogenous lipoproteins. An ApoE dependent penetration of the BBB
   was confirmed and provided an indication of apolipoprotein mediated
   transcytosis, avoiding lysosomal degradation.}},

Abstract = {{For traditional dye-sensitized solar cells, one method to increase the
   long-term stability and enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is
   to explore the use of bifacial and quasi-solid-state cells (BQDSSCs). In
   the current work, CoSe2 nanorods with lengths of 70-500 nm and widths of
   20-60 nm were prepared via a simple hydrothermal method and served as
   the counter electrode (CE) material. The photovoltaic results of the
   bifacial cell revealed that the front and rear irradiation PCEs of the
   CoSe2 CE can reach 8.02\% and 4.22\%, which are higher than those of Pt
   CE (7.46\% and 4.04\%, respectively), by employing a polyvinylidene
   fluoride quasi-solid-state electrolyte. Moreover, the CoSe2 nanorod CE
   possess a good light on-off photocurrent response and switching
   stability in the BQDSSCs device. The excellent efficiency and long-term
   photovoltaic stability of the CoSe2 CE-based BQDSSCs were derived from
   the unique one-dimensional nanostructure and superior electrocatalytic
   properties for the reduction reaction of I-3(-) to I-, as revealed by
   cyclic voltammetry (CV), Tafel polarization, and electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Furthermore, the CoSe2 CE
   material exhibits excellent electrochemical stability for catalyzing the
   reduction of I-3(-). Our work inspires the development of high
   efficiency selenides electrode materials for use in the BQDSSCs field.}},

Title = {{Rational engineering of chromic material as near-infrared ratiometric
   fluorescent nanosensor for H2S monitoring in real food samples}},
Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{323}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Food pollution has aroused increasing public health concerns and poses a
   huge medical and financial burden today. Here, we report a facile
   one-pot synthesis of hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-responsive near-infrared
   (NIR) ratiometric fluorescent nanoprobe NIR775/Cy7Cl@HyNPs by
   encapsulating H2S-sensitive organic chromic cyanine dye Cy7Cl and
   H2S-inert fluorophore NIR775 into an amphiphilic phospholipid polymer.
   Because of the confinement effect of phospholipid layer, the loaded
   NIR775 and Cy7Cl could be brought in close proximity for fluorescence
   resonance energy transfer (FRET) to occur, leading to single emission of
   Cy7Cl at similar to 810 nm inside nanoprobe NIR775/Cy7Cl@HyNPs. However,
   with the introduction of H2S, the FRET process from NIR775 to Cy7Cl is
   disrupted due to the stimuli-responsive chromic behavior as a result of
   H2S-triggered nucleophilic, leading to restoring of the fluorescence
   emission of NIR775 at similar to 778 nm companied by a remarkable
   fluorescence decrease of Cy7Cl at similar to 810 nm, thereby enabling
   nanoprobe NIR775/Cy7Cl@HyNPs to show a NIR ratiometric response toward
   H2S. As expected, the nanoprobe NIR775/Cy7Cl@HyNPs exhibits a prominent
   practicability to precisely report the levels of H2S in actual food
   mediums with a wide linear range of 0.0367-120.0 mu M, a satisfactory
   limit detection of 11.0 nM, as well as an excellent specificity over
   other sulfur-containing substances (e.g. biothiols). This study
   emphasizes the promise for utilizing switchable chromic materials to
   develop a new category of NIR ratiometric fluorescent nanosensors
   facilitating accurate and reliable measurement in actual food and
   agriculture-related systems without any pretreatments, which is of great
   significance for safeguarding food safety and human health.}},

Abstract = {{Density change is ubiquitous in phase transformation, and it can induce
   melt convection which strongly influences the crystal growth. Here, an
   anisotropic lattice Boltzmann-phase-field method was extended to predict
   the dendritic growth under the shrinkage or expansion melt convection by
   density change induced. A novel LB equation with an anisotropic
   coefficient was constructed to model the advancement of ordering
   parameter, coupling with the passive scalar LB equation for convective
   and diffusive heat transfer during phase transition. We studied
   dendritic growth and shape selection with melt convection induced by
   density change in crystal growth. Results show that the melt convection
   induced by density change affects strongly the dendritic growth. The
   shrinkage flow results in a higher tip velocity while the expansion flow
   leads to a slower one. Predicted Peclet number with respect to the
   relative density change was compared with an analytical solution.
   Moreover, the modified selection parameter has been verified by
   numerical simulations. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{252}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A separation-of-variable method was proposed in 2009 by the present
   authors and co-workers (Xing YF, Liu B. New exact solutions for free
   vibrations of thin orthotropic rectangular plates. Compos Struct
   2009;89:567-74), but this traditional separation-of-variable method is
   incapable for free boundary conditions. Hence, this work is to improve
   the traditional separation-of-variable method to make it capable of
   dealing with free boundary conditions. This new method is called the
   improved separation-of-variable method, in which the characteristic
   differential governing equation is solved directly, and the free
   boundary conditions also have separable forms, which are achieved with
   the Rayleigh's variational principle. In addition, the relationships
   between spatial eigenvalues and temporal eigenvalue are quite concise.
   For plates without free edges, the proposed method reduces to the
   traditional separation-of-variable method. Numerical experiments
   validate the improved method. The present technique of handling free
   boundary conditions is a general methodology for eigenvalue problems
   such as free vibration and eigenbuckling.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, the all-dielectric metasurface has attracted
   great interest due to its unconventional electromagnetic properties with
   insignificant Ohmic loss. It can particularly provide new opportunities
   for the design of optical reflector and nanocavity of lasers with a

   vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) based on metasurfaces
   reflector of several hundred nanometers in thickness. Comparing with the
   distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) based lasers and spasers, our proposed
   VCSEL using two layers of the silicon cylinder arrays instead of
   multi-layer Bragg grating structure and free from high dissipative loss
   in plasmonics. Our design offers enormous potential in manipulating
   light emission and provides an essential step for developing high
   efficiency, ultra-compact, and directional lasers.}},

   cell growth by apoptosis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{1220}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In our previous work, we have synthesized a series of dibenzoxanthenes
   which showed antitumor activity. However the antiproliferation ability
   toward gastric cancer cells and the mechanism still is not known. Three
   new dibenzoxanthenes were synthesized by oxidized the binaphthol in this
   study. We studied the interaction between compounds and Calf thymus
   (CT-DNA) by electronic absorption titration, luminescence spectra,
   viscosity experiments and DFT computation. The mode of compounds binding
   with DNA was intercalation. We demonstrated that compounds inhibited the
   proliferation of gastric cancer cells by MTT assay. The antitumor effect
   of these compounds was triggered by S phase cell cycle arrest and
   induced the apoptosis of cells. The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis
   was confirmed by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the
   release of cyto C, the decrease expression of Bcl-2 protein and the
   increase expression of cleaved PARR Bax, Bid, Bad proteins. Compounds
   also enhanced the concentration of calcium and ROS in SGC-7901 cells.
   All the above results indicated that compounds 4a-4c strongly suppressed
   the proliferation of gastric cancer cells via inducing cell cycle arrest
   and cell apoptosis, suggesting that compounds are potential novel
   therapeutic agents for gastric cancer. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, the in-vitro bone regeneration ability of commercial pure
   titanium (CP-Ti) surface modified via electrospun
   polyvinylidene/hydroxyapatite (PVP/HA) masking and subsequent Nd-YAG
   pulsed laser treatment was investigated. The ratio of HA to PVP played a
   significant role in achieving a perfect homogenous mask on the CP-Ti. In
   the laser treatment process, the parameter of area scanning speed (ASS)
   had an important influence on the final surface morphology. A favorable
   range was defined for this parameter where these two conditions were
   satisfied: no PVP remaining and no severe substrate melting. Within a
   favorable range of ASS, as decreasing ASS exchanged the surface
   structure from detached particles to a pattern-like network. The calcium
   titanate CaTiO3 (CTO) and a-tricalcium phosphate (alpha-TCP) were formed
   as the main components on the CP-Ti surface. The coating had an adequate
   adhesion to the CP-Ti surface. Furthermore, a surface with a water
   affinity between hydrophilic and hydrophobic was obtained. The in-vitro
   bioactivity test revealed that the surface modification enhanced the
   bone-like apatite formation. The cytocompatibility assays confirmed that
   the cell attachment and spreading of the osteosarcoma-like cells (MG63)
   were improved by the surface treatment. The development of surface
   modification techniques opens new avenues in bone tissue engineering
   applications.}},

   as compatibilizers for the immiscible TPU/MVQ blends}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{530}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Herein, silane-functionalized carbon nanodots (Si-CDs) with different
   sizes and surface grafting density were successfully fabricated by a
   facile and cost-effective one-pot solvothermal treatment and
   incorporated for the first time as novel compatibilizers into the
   thermoplastic polyurethane/methyl vinyl silicone rubber (TPU/MVQ)
   blends. As obtained fluorescent Si-CDs with a size of 2 nm and
   functionalized with maximum amido and silane chains, called Si-CDs-High,
   displayed better compatibilizing efficiency than other Si-CDs with large
   size and low grafting density. The average diameter of MVQ domain in the
   blend reduced sharply from 2.51 +/- 1.03 mu m to 0.91 +/- 0.28 mu m at a
   small content of 1 wt\% of Si-CDs-High. As effective compatibilizers,
   Si-CDs-High were located at the interface and formed a stable interface
   layer between TPU and MVQ phases and the thickness of interface was
   quantitatively identified by using Atomic Force Microscope. The superior
   compatibilizing efficiency of Si-CDs-High can be attributed that such
   Si-CDs with sufficient chains and groups can not only prevent
   coalescence of polymer domains by rigid nanoparticle core but also
   enhance interfacial adhesion due to the molecular entanglements and
   hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, the polymer blends with Si-CDs-High
   exhibited enhanced mechanical property, thermal stability and tunable
   fluorescent properties. This strategy compatibilized by fluorescent
   Si-CDs paves a new possibility for advanced blend nanocomposites.}},

Abstract = {{Underwater optical wireless communication has attracted widespread
   attention due to its high bandwidth. The complex compositions of
   seawater affect the transmission of underwater optical signals. However,
   for underwater optical wireless channel modeling, the turbulence effect
   cannot be integrated into the Monte Carlo simulation framework for
   absorption and scattering. Based on the generalized Snell's Law, we
   extend the multiple phase screen model to unify turbulence effects,
   absorption and scattering effects into the Monte Carlo simulation
   framework, which allows us to study the integration of absorption,
   scattering and turbulence effects on underwater channels simultaneously.
   The received intensity probability density distribution, spatial light
   intensity distribution and power loss are investigated. To the best of
   our knowledge, this is the first time to explore the integration of
   absorption, scattering and turbulence effects on underwater optical

Abstract = {{In the study, we investigate the generation of optofluidic laser in

   is created on the end-facet of a fiber using the method of CO2 laser
   ablation and subsequent coating with dielectric layers. Coumarin 6 in

   comparison, we first test the laser generation in a stable FP
   microcavity formed by a concave mirror on a fiber and a planar mirror on
   the substrate of a fused silica without cavity assembly. In this
   configuration, we can obtain the laser emission with an ultralow pumping
   energy of 25.5 mu J/ mm(2) at the gain concentration of 10 mu M and a
   detection limit of gain solution as low as 2 mu M. Then, the generation
   of optofluidic laser is explored in a polymeric optofluidic chip
   integrated with a stable fiber FP microcavity in the format of
   planar-concave mirrors and a microfluidic channel. Laser results in this

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{501-513}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Diabetic vitreous hemorrhage (DVH) is a common complication of diabetes.
   While the diagnostic methods nowadays only concentrate on the eye injury
   in DVH patients, whether DVH leads to abnormalities of other visual
   systems, including the eye, the visual cortex, and other brain regions,
   remains unknown.
   AIM
   To explore the potential changes of brain activity in DVH using regional
   homogeneity (ReHo) and their relationships with clinical features.
   METHODS
   Thirty-one DVH patients and 31 matched healthy controls (HCs) were
   recruited. All subjects were examined by resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. The neural homogeneity in the brain region
   was estimated by ReHo method. Pearson correlation analysis was used to
   evaluate the relationships between average ReHo values and clinical
   manifestations in DVH patients.
   RESULTS
   Compared with HCs, the ReHo values in the bilateral cerebellar posterior
   lobes, right superior (RS)/middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and bilateral
   superior frontal gyrus were significantly increased. In contrast, in the
   right insula, bilateral medial frontal gyri, and right middle frontal
   gyrus, the ReHo values were significantly decreased. Furthermore, we
   found that best-corrected visual acuity of the contralateral eye in
   patients with DVH presented a positive correlation with the mean ReHo
   value of the RS/MOG. We also found that depression score of the DVH
   group presented a negative correlation with the mean ReHo values of the
   right insula, bilateral medial frontal gyrus, and right middle frontal
   gyrus.
   CONCLUSION
   We found that DVH may cause dysfunction in multiple brain areas, which
   may benefit the exploration of pathologic mechanisms in DVH patients.}},

Title = {{Comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed microRNAs and mRNAs
   involved in diabetic corneal neuropathy}},
Journal = {{LIFE SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{261}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Aims: Corneal nerve fibers are derived from the ophthalmic division of
   the trigeminal ganglion (TG). Here, by sequencing of microRNAs (miRNAs)
   and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from diabetic and normal TG tissues, we aimed
   to uncover potential miRNAs, mRNAs, and the network of their
   interactions involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic corneal
   neuropathy.
   Main methods: We performed RNA sequencing to systematically screen out
   differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs in TG tissues from diabetic
   and normal mice. Functional enrichment analyses were performed to
   illustrate the biological functions of differentially expressed mRNAs
   (DEmRNAs). Following this, miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks were built by
   means of bioinformatics methods to suggest regulatory role for miRNAs in
   the pathogenesis of diabetic corneal neuropathy. Finally, the
   credibility of the sequencing-based results was validated using qRT-PCR.
   Key findings: Sequencing analyses disclosed that 68 miRNAs and 114 mRNAs
   were differentially expressed in diabetic TG tissues compared with
   normal TG samples. The functional analyses showed that DEmRNAs
   participated in diabetes-related biological processes. After applying an
   optimized approach to predict miRNA-mRNA pairs, a miRNA-mRNA interacting
   network was inferred. Subsequently, the expression and correlation of
   miR-350-5p and Mup20, miR-592-5p and Angptl7 as well as miR-351-5p and
   Elovl6 were preliminarily validated.
   Significance: Our study provides a systematic characterization of miRNA
   and mRNA expression in the TG during diabetic corneal neuropathy and
   will contribute to the development of clinical diagnostic and
   therapeutic strategies for diabetic corneal neuropathy.}},

   ({[}OMIM]{[}Ac]) and ethyl propionate + ethanol
   +1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate {[}HMIM]{[}Ac]) were measured at
   101.3 kPa. The reliability of the experimental procedure and apparatus
   was checked by comparing the binary experimental data with the
   literature data. Herington consistency test was conducted to check the
   thermodynamic consistency of the experimental data for the ethyl
   propionate + etanol binary system. The UNIQUAC model. NRTL model and
   Wilson model were used to correlate the vapor-liquid equilibrium data.
   The results showed that all three models are applicable to the system,
   but the calculated results by the NRTL model had the minimum deviation
   from the experimental data. Van Ness consistency test was carried out to
   check the reliability of the obtained NRTL parameters for thermodynamic
   consistency for the ternary systems. The addition of the three ionic
   liquids (ILs) improved the separation of the ethyl propionate-ethanol
   azeotropic system. Furthermore, the higher the concentration of the
   ionic liquid, the better the separation effect. The separation
   performance of the three ILs is: {[}DMIMI{[}Ac] < {[}OMIM]{[}Ac] <

Abstract = {{Nasicon-type Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)(3) (x = 0-0.5) electrolytes have been
   prepared via a facile and economic method. All synthetic electrolyte
   samples show Nasicon structure and good crystallinity. The Al doping
   content has a great influence on the electrical conductivity of
   electrolyte. The electrolyte with the composition of
   Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)(3) exhibits a highest electrical conductivity of
   2.72 x 10(-4) S/cm at room temperature, which is mainly attributable to
   fewer impurity and dense electrolyte structure. The LiFePO4/Li cell
   assembled with this electrolyte delivers an initial specific discharge
   capacity of 127.86 mAh g(-1) at a charge/discharge current density of
   0.5C at 60 degrees C, which shows an excellent cycling performance with
   high discharge capacity of 131.2 mAhg(-1) after 150 cycles. These
   results suggest that the Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)(3) electrolyte is a
   potential electrolyte for all solid state lithium-ion battery.}},

Abstract = {{This research is geared towards the improvement of the dynamic response
   of the corrugated sandwiched composite structures under low-velocity
   impact. A novel glass fibre reinforced double-corrugated sandwiched
   composite (DCSC) structure was designed and was manufactured by using a
   vacuum assisted resin infusion (VARI) technique. The lattice core of the
   DCSC was formed by crosslinked composites as reinforced layers and PVC
   foam blocks as energy absorption components. The dynamic response of the
   proposed sandwiched composite structures on different locations was
   evaluated through low-velocity drop-weight impact tests and was compared
   to that of traditional single-corrugated sandwiched composite (SCSC)
   structures. Finally, the optical microscopy and mu-CT technique were
   utilized to explore failure mechanisms and damage affected zone within
   the specimens. The results indicated that the maximum impact load and
   the energy absorption capability before the structural failure of the
   DSCS structure were significantly improved combined with a lower
   indentation comparing to the traditional SCSC configuration only with a
   slight weight increase. No severe damage was observed given low impact
   energy. Fibre fracture, foam rupture and face-to-foam debonding became
   dominant while the energy was increased.}},

Title = {{Wind erosion events at different wind speed levels in the Tarim Basin}},
Journal = {{GEOMORPHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{369}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Wind is a dynamic force in deserts and is responsible for wind erosion
   when its speed exceeds a given threshold velocity (u(t)). This study
   classified these wind speeds (>= u(t)) at intervals of 1 m/s and aimed
   to determine the characteristics of wind erosion events (horizontal dust
   flux and duration of the wind erosion event) at different wind speed
   levels (WSLs) based on continuously measured meteorological data
   recorded from 2009 to 2018 at 12 meteorological stations. In addition,
   their relationships with the WSL were analyzed in the Tarim Basin. The
   results indicated that 8257\% of the total wind erosion events occurred
   at WSL 1 and 2 (u(t) to u(t) + 2 m/s). As the WSL increased, the
   duration of wind erosion events decreased rapidly. More than 50\% of the
   total horizontal dust flux presented at WSL 2 and 3 (u(t) + 1 m/s to
   u(t) + 3 m/s), and all stations showed a maximum value at WSL 2 except
   RQ which was at WSL3. We also found that at WSL 1, the contribution of
   duration to the total amount was much greater than that of the
   horizontal dust flux, and it was basically consistent at WSL 2. With the
   increase in WSL, the contribution of duration to the total amount became
   gradually smaller than that of the horizontal dust flux. Furthermore,
   according to the spatial distribution, the high incidence of wind
   erosion events occurred in the southeast and central of TB at each WSL.
   Moreover, the regression model that best described the relationship
   between the WSL and the characteristics of wind erosion events was an
   exponential function (T-A x e(-BVL) and F = C x e(-)(D)(VL)
   respectively). The results obtained from this study could provide a new
   insight for the evaluation of wind erosion in arid and semi-arid areas.

Abstract = {{Double functional groups modified bagasse (DFMBs), a series of new
   zwitterionic groups of carboxyl and amine modified adsorbents, were
   prepared through grafting tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) onto the
   pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) modified bagasse using the DCC/DMAP
   method. DFMBs' ability to simultaneously remove basic magenta (BM,
   cationic dye) and Congo red (CR, anionic dye) from aqueous solution in
   single and binary dye systems was investigated. FTIR spectra and Zeta
   potential analysis results showed that PMDA and TEPA were successfully
   grafted onto the surface of bagasse, and the ratio of the amount of
   carboxyl groups and amine groups was controlled by the addition of a
   dosage of TEPA. Adsorption results showed that adsorption capacities of
   DFMBs for BM decreased while that for CR increased with the increase of
   the amount of TEPA in both single and binary dye systems, and BM or CR
   was absorbed on the modified biosorbents was mainly through
   electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond. The adsorption for BM and CR
   could reach equilibrium within 300 min, both processes were fitted well
   by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The cationic and anionic dyes
   removal experiment in the binary system showed that DMFBs could be
   chosen as adsorbents to treat wastewater containing different ratios of
   cationic and anionic dyes.}},

   and mesoporous silica in bio-ethanol reforming - The role of the clay
   component}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CLAY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{198}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Embedded catalysts, featuring Fe species on the surface of Porous Clay
   derived Heterostructures (PCH) and mesoporous silica (SBA-15 or MMS
   type) were developed. Two different methods of iron deposition were
   applied, affecting different activity in steam reforming of ethanol. The
   nature and distribution of nanostructured Fe-O moieties formed on the
   surface of porous supports and the role of clay component in H-2
   production were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) method, scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), temperature-programmed reduction with the
   hydrogen (H-2-TPR), CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD), and
   advanced Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fe-57 Mossbauer
   spectroscopy (MS). The speciation of Fe moieties in the function of Fe
   interaction with the support entailed the creation of nanostructured
   catalysts active in H-2 production. Dispersion of the Fe species on the
   surface of mesoporous silica promoted the dehydration of ethanol to
   ethylene occurring on the developed acidic sites. The formation of iron
   oxide nanocrystals was beneficial for H-2 production. The introduction
   of amorphous silica between the layers of Laponite (Lap) in PCH
   composite resulted in the developing of a flexible base for the
   embedding of active centres, available to reagents and highly selective
   to H-2. The composition and the basic nature of the Lap in Fe-PCH
   composites contributed to the increase of H-2 content in the reaction
   products. The applied treatment forced the migration of MgII from the
   octahedral sheet of Laponite to the PCH surface. The developed Mg
   entities influenced the basicity of the PCH surface shifting the
   reaction balance towards hydrogen formation, limiting the dehydration of
   ethanol to ethylene - the precursor of coke deposits.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose There are no criteria to establish priority for bariatric
   surgery candidates in the public health system in several countries. The
   aim of this study is to identify preoperative characteristics that allow
   predicting the success after bariatric surgery. Materials and Methods
   Four hundred and sixty-one patients submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric
   bypass were included. Success of the surgery was defined as the sum of
   five outcome variables, assessed at baseline and 12 months after the
   surgery: excess weight loss, use of continuous positive airway pressure
   (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) as a treatment for
   obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), daily number of antidiabetics, daily
   number of antihypertensive drugs, and all-cause mortality. Partial least
   squares (PLS) regression and multiple linear regression were performed
   to identify preoperative predictors. We performed a 90/10 split of the
   dataset in train and test sets and ran a leave-one-out cross-validation
   on the train set and the best PLS model was chosen based on
   goodness-of-fit criteria. Results The preoperative predictors of success
   after bariatric surgery included lower age, presence of non-alcoholic
   fatty liver disease and OSA, more years of CPAP/BiPAP use, negative
   history of cardiovascular disease, and lower number of antihypertensive
   drugs. The PLS model displayed a mean absolute percent error of 0.1121
   in the test portion of the dataset, leading to accurate predictions of
   postoperative outcomes. Conclusion This success index allows
   prioritizing patients with the best indication for the procedure and
   could be incorporated in the public health system as a support tool in
   the decision-making process.}},

Abstract = {{Supramolecular aggregates of synthetic dye molecules offer great
   perspectives to prepare biomimetic functional materials for
   light-harvesting and energy transport. The design is complicated by the
   fact that structure-property relationships are hard to establish,
   because the molecular packing results from a delicate balance of
   interactions and the excitonic properties that dictate the optics and
   excited state dynamics, in turn sensitively depend on this packing. Here
   we show how an iterative multiscale approach combining molecular
   dynamics and quantum mechanical exciton modeling can be used to obtain
   accurate insight into the packing of thousands of cyanine dye molecules
   in a complex double-walled tubular aggregate in close interaction with
   its solvent environment. Our approach allows us to answer open questions
   not only on the structure of these prototypical aggregates, but also
   about their molecular-scale structural and energetic heterogeneity, as
   well as on the microscopic origin of their photophysical properties.
   This opens the route to accurate predictions of energy transport and
   other functional properties.}},

Abstract = {{Single-factor delivery is the most common characteristic of bone tissue
   engineering techniques. However, bone regeneration is a complex process
   requiring multiple factors and specialized release mechanisms.
   Therefore, the development of a dual-delivery system allowing for
   programmed release kinetics would be highly desirable. Improvement of
   the molarity and versatility of the delivery system has rarely been
   studied. Herein, we report the development of a novel, modular
   programmed biphasic dual-release system (SCB), carrying a BMP2 and an
   engineered collagen I-derived recognition motif (Stath-DGEA), with a
   self-remodification feature on hydroxyapatite (HA)-based materials. The
   SCB system was loaded onto an additive manufactured (AM) scaffold in
   order to evaluate its bifactor osteogenic potential and its biphasic
   release behavior. Further, the biomechanical properties of the scaffold
   were studied by using the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) method.
   Section fluorescent labeling revealed that the HA scaffold has a
   relatively higher density and efficiency. Additionally, the results of
   the release and inhibition experiment suggested that the SCB system
   could facilitate the sustained release of therapeutic levels of two
   factors during the initial stage of implantation, thereby exhibiting a
   rapid high-dose release pattern at a specific time point during the
   second stage. The FSI prediction model indicated that the scaffold
   provides an excellent biomimetic mechanical and fluid dynamic
   microenvironment to promote osteogenesis. Our results indicated that
   incorporation of BMP2 with Stath-DGEA in the biphasic SCB system could
   have a synergetic effect in promoting the adhesion, proliferation, and
   differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in vitro,
   under staged stimulations. Further, in vivo studies in both ectopic and
   orthotopic rat models showed that the SCB system loaded onto an AM
   scaffold could enhance osteointegration and osteoinduction throughout
   the osteogenic process. Thus, the novel synthetic SCB system described
   herein used on an AM scaffold provides a biomimetic extracellular
   environment that enhances bone regeneration and is a promising
   multifunctional, dual-release platform.}},

Abstract = {{In sport, an ``explosion{''} of information has meant that coaches may
   not have the time or cognitive resources to integrate it effectively
   into their decision-making. Research suggests that a disconnect exists
   between the information provided from the ``sport scientist to
   coach{''}, and subsequently between ``coach to player{''}. Further
   investigation is required to determine the detail within the tactical
   and technical instruction, with the aim of creating better alignment and
   implementation between the performance data collected and actual coach
   requirements during a game. Using inductive content analysis, with an
   independent researcher acting as a ``critical friend{''}, themes and
   dimensions were extracted from audio recordings of six coaches' (ANZ
   Premiership netball) conversations during competition. Analysis of the
   transcribed recordings found that the coaches discussed the technical
   and tactical elements of the game 695 times, within five general
   dimensions; movement (38.4\%), actions (23.9\%), positioning (17.3\%),
   possession outcomes (10.6\%) and strategy (9.8\%). Within these 5
   dimensions there were 17 higher order themes including; and 56 lower
   order themes. This study shows five dimensions that a performance
   analyst can use when designing data collection workflows. These themes
   are discussed in relation to the latest performance analysis literature
   and highlight the need for further research into the data sources that
   can provide information about them.}},

Abstract = {{The construct of Parental Acceptance-Rejection (PAR) impacts a person's
   mental health and well-being well into adulthood and has many adverse
   outcomes. Sexual orientation minorities are at particular risk for
   parental rejection. Sexual orientation minorities who experience
   parental rejection are at risk for substance use, internalized
   homophobia, and a disrupted sense of identity. Furthermore, regardless
   of PAR, the sexual orientation minority population already has an
   increased risk of mental health issues, notably higher personality
   psychopathology rates. However, no research has examined the role of PAR
   on personality psychopathology in sexual orientation minority
   populations. This study examined the association between PAR and
   personality psychopathology and impairment in a sample of 79 people
   whoself-identify as sexual minorities. Significant correlations were
   found between parental rejection and rates of pathological personality
   traits and impairment. Identity-related moderators were examined, and
   multiple interaction effects were identified. Implications and future

Abstract = {{The use of ZnO as a photocatalyst for organics degradation has been

   prepared through the chemical precipitation route at room temperature
   has been calcined at mild temperatures to gradually eliminate surface
   -OH groups. Although the increase in annealing time had promoted the
   crystallite size to increase through the elimination of Zn(OH)(2), the
   particle growth reduced the specific surface area and surface
   hydroxylation, both of which are critical features concerning
   photocatalysis. The probing of the main degradation mechanisms evinced
   that the generation of OH{*} radicals is the only relevant process for
   oxidation, which is closely related to the nature of -OH groups. After
   the complete ZnO crystallization, a balance of morphology, surface area,
   exposed surface, and surface hydroxylation is necessary to obtain the
   most efficient materials.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of the efficiency of the absorbed dose depth distribution
   as a function of the kinetic energy spectrum of a submicrosecond
   electron beam showed that the use of two operating modes of a
   submicrosecond electron accelerator, which differ in the amplitude of
   the accelerating voltage pulse (200 and 300 kV), under irradiation of
   various materials can provide different effects determined by different
   depth distributions of absorbed energy. For the constructed spectra of
   the beam electron kinetic energies, we used a model sample that takes
   into account the structure and penetration of the material, which
   determines the conditions for the electron beam absorbed energy
   distribution over the depth. Based on the experimental data, the
   absorbed dose in the structural parts of the object was estimated using
   the example of a wheat seed, and conclusions were drawn about the
   efficiency of using irradiation modes with different kinetic energy
   spectra of electrons in the beam.}},

Abstract = {{Using ab initio quantum-transport simulations, we studied the intrinsic
   transfer characteristics and benchmarks of the ballistic performance of
   5.1 nm double-gated Schottky-barrier field effect transistors (SBFETs)
   consisting of in-plane (IP) heterojunctions of metallic-phase (1T or 1T
   `) MTe2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf, Cr, Mo, W) and semiconducting-phase (2H) WSe2,
   WTe2 and Janus WSeTe. The 2H-phase Janus WSeTe is a semiconductor with
   an indirect bandgap (1.26 eV), which is less than the bandgap of
   2H-phase WSe2 (1.64 eV) and is greater than the bandgap of 2H-phase WTe2
   (1.02 eV). The band alignments show that all IP 1T/2H contacts are
   Schottky-barrier contacts with the Fermi levels of 1T or 1T ` MTe2 (M =
   Ti, Zr, Hf, Cr, Mo, W) located within the bandgaps of 2H WSe2, WTe2 and
   Janus WSeTe. Although double-gated IP WSe2-SBFETs can satisfy the OFF
   current requirement, their ON currents all fall below the requirements
   of the high performance transistor outlined by the ITRS (International
   Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, 2013 version) for the production
   year 2028. Double-gated IP WTe2-SBFETs cannot overcome the short channel
   effect leading to minimum drain currents all beyond the OFF current
   requirement of ITRS (2013 version) for the production year 2028.
   Fortunately, double-gated IP WSeTe-SBFETs with 1T MoTe2 or 1T ` WTe2
   electrodes can overcome the short channel effect and satisfy the
   requirements of the high-performance transistor outlined by the ITRS
   (2013 version) for the production year 2028.}},

Abstract = {{The relevance and presence of Electric Vehicles (EVs) are increasing all
   over the world since they seem an effective way to fight pollution and
   greenhouse gas emissions, especially in urban areas. One of the main
   issues related to EVs is the necessity of modifying the existing
   infrastructure to allow the installation of new charging stations (CSs).
   In this scenario, one of the most important problems is the definition
   of smart policies for the sequencing and scheduling of the vehicle
   charging process. The presence of intermittent energy sources and
   variable execution times represent just a few of the specific features
   concerning vehicle charging systems. Even though optimization problems
   regarding energy systems are usually considered within a discrete time
   setting, in this paper a discrete event approach is proposed. The
   fundamental reason for this choice is the necessity of limiting the
   number of the decision variables, which grows beyond reasonable values
   when a short time discretization step is chosen. The considered
   optimization problem regards the charging of a series of vehicles by a
   CS connected with a renewable energy source, a storage element, and the
   main grid. The objective function to be minimized results from the
   weighted sum of the (net) cost for purchasing energy from the external
   grid, the weighted tardiness of the services provided to the customers,
   and a cost related to the occupancy of the socket during the charging.
   The approach is tested on a real case study. The limited computational
   burden allows also the implementation in real-case applications.}},

Abstract = {{A major obstacle hindering further development of kesterite
   Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)(4) (CZTSSe) solar cells is the inherent recombination
   losses that occur both via bulk defects and charge extraction
   interfaces. Herein, we propose a generic Ag, Ge dual-gradient absorber
   architecture, involving a downshift of absorber VBM at the front contact
   and an upshift of absorber CBM at the back contact, to improve device
   performance. We experimentally show that the substitution of Cu by Ag
   allows for larger band bending at the p-n junction, and the substitution
   of Sn by Ge imposes an additional drift field within the quasi-neutral
   region. Additionally, the Ag and Ge ions diffusing into the bulk
   absorber passivate the deleterious Cu-Zn and Cu-Sn deep-level defects.
   In turn, accelerated charge extraction, transport and minimized
   recombination loss offered surprising gains in V-oc and J(sc), and the
   dual-gradient device achieved a maximum efficiency of 12.26\% with an
   improved V-oc,V-deficit of 553 mV. This Ag, Ge graded-substitution
   approach offers an alternative absorber architecture to improve the
   V-oc,V-deficit in future high-efficiency kesterite PV cells.}},

Abstract = {{Presurgical evaluation and surgery in the pediatric age group are unique
   in challenges related to caring for the very young, range of etiologies,
   choice of appropriate investigations, and surgical procedures. Accepted
   standards that define the criteria for levels of presurgical evaluation
   and epilepsy surgery care do not exist. Through a modified Delphi
   process involving 61 centers with experience in pediatric epilepsy
   surgery across 20 countries, including low-middle- to high-income
   countries, we established consensus for two levels of care. Levels were
   based on age, etiology, complexity of presurgical evaluation, and
   surgical procedure. Competencies were assigned to the levels of care
   relating to personnel, technology, and facilities. Criteria were
   established when consensus was reached (>= 75\% agreement). Level 1 care
   consists of children age 9 years and older, with discrete lesions
   including hippocampal sclerosis, undergoing lobectomy or lesionectomy,
   preferably on the cerebral convexity and not close to eloquent cortex,
   by a team including a pediatric epileptologist, pediatric neurosurgeon,
   and pediatric neuroradiologist with access to
   video-electroencephalography and 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   Level 2 care, also encompassing Level 1 care, occurs across the age span
   and range of etiologies (including tuberous sclerosis complex,
   Sturge-Weber syndrome, hypothalamic hamartoma) associated with MRI
   lesions that may be ill-defined, multilobar, hemispheric, or multifocal,
   and includes children with normal MRI or foci in/abutting eloquent
   cortex. Available Level 2 technologies includes 3-T MRI, other advanced
   magnetic resonance technology including functional MRI and diffusion
   tensor imaging (tractography), positron emission tomography and/or
   single photon emission computed tomography, source localization with
   electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography, and the ability to
   perform intra- or extraoperative invasive monitoring and functional
   mapping, by a large multidisciplinary team with pediatric expertise in
   epilepsy, neurophysiology, neuroradiology, epilepsy neurosurgery,
   neuropsychology, anesthesia, neurocritical care, psychiatry, and
   nursing. Levels of care will improve safety and outcomes for pediatric
   epilepsy surgery and provide standards for personnel and technology to
   achieve these levels.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrile imine-mediated tetrazole-ene cycloaddition (NITEC) was
   successfully used to cross-link complementary tetrazole and maleimide
   chitosan derivatives into hydrogel networks using irradiation. The
   photo-click reaction resulted in the formation of robust fluorescent
   hydrogels with an emission signal at around 530 nm. The degree of
   cross-linking and the resulting hydrogel properties such as pH
   sensitivity and swelling were influenced by the tetrazole/maleimide
   ratio and the length of irradiation. Interestingly, rheological studies
   demonstrated self-healing character of the novel hydrogels as indicated
   by instantaneous recovery of the storage modulus to the initial values
   under different oscillatory strains without any additional external
   trigger. Finally, in addition to their photo-tuneable and self-healing
   properties, the novel chitosan hydrogels were also found to be
   biocompatible and susceptible to in vitro enzymatic degradation, making
   them suitable for design of traceable biomaterials for biomedical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The Reflective Function (RF) Scale is the original validated
   measure of mentalizing, applied to Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)
   transcripts. This study aimed to replicate the preliminary validation of
   Computerized RF (CRF), a computerized text analysis measure of RF.
   Methods: 49 women with borderline personality disorder (BPD; n = 20) and
   without (n = 29) completed diagnostic interviews and the AAI. AAIs were
   scored by certified coders using the RF Scale, and by computerized text
   analysis software using CRF dictionaries.
   Results: CRF significantly correlated with RF. The frequency of High CRF
   words had moderate-to-strong correlations with RF in the total sample
   (r(s) = .47), BPD group (r(s) = .61), and non-BPD group (r(s) = .41).
   Adding the frequency of Low CRF words to create a proportion of High and
   Low CRF words, and applying CRF to AAIs trimmed to include only items
   that ``demand{''} RF, both produced significant, but not stronger,
   correlations with RF.
   Conclusion: CRF is an efficient alternative to the RF Scale that can
   estimate mentalization. Near average levels, neither RF nor CRF
   significantly differentiated between groups, indicating mentalizing
   deficits may not always be present, detectable, or defining in BPD
   samples. While more research is needed, CRF is a valid assessment of RF
   when codable text is available.}},

Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{S872-S886}},

Abstract = {{The socio-spatial density of cities creates a critical setting for the
   spread of viral infections. Urban public space provides a ground for
   people to interact with others outside of their immediate social
   network. Interaction with weak or absent social ties is critical in the
   spread of the pandemic, as it represents a connection with strangers.
   Accordingly, non-pharmaceutical urban measures often aim to limit these
   interactions as a means for mitigating the spread of COVID-19. This
   paper explores the effects of these control measures, comparing the mean
   distances between geotagged tweets within an eight-month timeframe in
   the city of Kyrenia, Cyprus. Furthermore, the paper questions the
   lasting effects of these measures on the socio-spatial structure of the
   city. The results indicate that the mean distance between tweets
   increases during the full quarantine and goes down immediately after the
   restrictions are lifted, but it does not reach its pre-pandemic status.
   The outcome also shows the localisation of activities during the
   outbreak which necessitates further elaboration on the relationship
   between newly emerged social norms and urban space.}},

Title = {{The influence of spin-orbit coupling, Duschinsky rotation and

   and its fused analog fluorenone: a time dependent correlation function
   based approach}},

Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{To understand the effect of structural rigidity or flexibility on the
   intersystem crossing rate, herein we have adopted a time dependent
   correlation function based approach, an appropriate method for a
   harmonic oscillator under Condon approximation. Following this
   technique, we have developed generalized codes for calculating the rate
   of intersystem crossing (ISC) both at 0 K and at finite temperature.
   Since the rate of ISC is a measurable quantity, we have separated the
   real and imaginary parts of the complex correlation function carefully
   and eliminated the imaginary part by exploiting the odd nature of this
   function. Using this simplified method, we have calculated the ISC rate
   constant (k(ISC)) of two molecules, namely, benzophenone and its fused
   analog, fluorenone. The calculations clearly elucidate that k(ISC) of
   benzophenone is 10(3) times larger compared to that of fluorenone.
   Interestingly, our analyses reveal that the combined effect of
   spin-orbit coupling and the number of normal modes could increase the
   rate of ISC of benzophenone by three orders in comparison to that of
   fluorenone. Furthermore, the Duschinsky rotation matrix (J) and
   displacement vectors (D) could influence the rate of ISC by one order
   each, indicating that the overall rate of ISC of benzophenone could have
   been 10(5) times higher than that of fluorenone if the latter two
   factors, namely, J and D have practically no impact on the rate of ISC
   of fluorenone. However, it has been found that albeit J can't alter the
   rate of ISC of fluorenone, D indeed can change the rate by two orders,
   thereby keeping the overall ratio of the rate of ISC of benzophenone and
   fluorenone as 10(3). The present study elucidates that none of the above
   mentioned factors alone can explain the relative rate of ISC of the
   studied systems; rather a complex interplay between all these factors
   makes the rate of ISC of benzophenone 10(3) times higher than that of
   fluorenone.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores the cardiorespiratory and muscular fatigue responses
   to downhill (DR) vs uphill running (UR) at similar running speed or
   similar oxygen uptake ((V)over dotO(2)). Eight well-trained, male, trail
   runners completed a maximal level incremental test and three 15-min
   treadmill running trials at +/- 15\% slope: i) DR at similar to 6
   km.h(-1) and similar to 19\% (V)over dotO(2max) (LDR); ii) UR at similar
   to 6 km.h(-1) and similar to 70\% (V)over dotO(2max) (HUR); iii) DR at
   similar to 19 km.h(-1) and similar to 70\% V?O-2max (HDR).
   Cardiorespiratory responses and spatiotemporal gait parameters were
   measured continuously. Maximal isometric torque was assessed before and
   after each trial for hip and knee extensors and plantar flexor muscles.
   At similar speed (similar to 6 km.h(-1)), cardiorespiratory responses
   were attenuated in LDR vs HUR with altered running kinematics (all p <
   0.05). At similar (V)over dotO(2) (similar to 3 l.min(-1)), heart rate,
   pulmonary ventilation and breathing frequency were exacerbated in HDR vs
   HUR (p < 0.01), with reduced torque in knee (-15\%) and hip (-11\%)
   extensors and altered spatiotemporal gait parameters (all p < 0.01).
   Despite submaximal metabolic intensity (70\% (V)over dotO(2max)), heart
   rate and respiratory frequency reached maximal values in HDR. These
   results further our understanding of the particular cardiorespiratory
   and muscular fatigue responses to DR and provide the bases for future DR
   training programs for trail runners.}},

   the AL group, tibial tantalum cone and impaction grafting were performed
   significantly less frequently than the control group (p = 0.002 and p <
   0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking, right-sided
   TKA, and large femoral canal anteroposterior diameter were factors that
   increased the risk of AL after re-revision, while tibial tantalum cone
   decreased the risk of loosening. Smokers had an 11.847-fold higher risk
   for AL; right-sided TKA led to a 4.594-fold higher risk for AL. However,
   the presence of a tibial tantalum cone was associated with an 8.403-fold
   lower risk for AL. Conclusions We conclude that smoking, right-sided
   prosthesis, and large femoral canal diameter increased the risk of AL,
   while tantalum cone and impaction grafting reduced this risk in patients
   who underwent re-revision surgery with rotating hinge prosthesis after
   TKA.}},

Abstract = {{The approaches based on natural abundance N2O stable isotopes are often
   applied for the estimation of mixing proportions between various
   N2O-producing pathways as well as for estimation of the extent of N2O
   reduction to N-2. But such applications are associated with numerous
   uncertainties; hence, their limited accuracy needs to be considered.
   Here we present the first systematic validation of these methods for
   laboratory and field studies by applying the N-15 gas-flux method as the
   reference approach.
   Besides applying dual-isotope plots for interpretation of N2O isotopic
   data, for the first time we propose a three dimensional N2O isotopocule
   model based on Bayesian statistics to estimate the N2O mixing
   proportions and reduction extent based simultaneously on three N2O
   isotopic signatures (delta N-15, delta N-15(SP), and delta O-18).
   Determination of the mixing proportions of individual pathways with N2O
   isotopic approaches often appears imprecise, mainly due to imperfect
   isotopic separation of the particular pathways. Nevertheless, the
   estimation of N2O reduction is much more robust, when applying an
   optimal calculation strategy, typically reaching an accuracy of N2O
   residual fraction determination of about 0.15.}},

   syndrome}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL \& NEONATAL MEDICINE}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   Metabolic syndrome and its indexes is one of the critical health
   problems during pregnancy. This study aimed to examine the effects of a
   care intervention program on pregnancy outcome in pregnant women with
   Metabolic Syndrome during 2017-2018.
   Methods
   This randomized clinical trial study was conducted in 120 singleton
   pregnant women with metabolic syndrome. The participants were selected
   using purposive sampling method from pregnant women referred to two
   health centers of Babol. They were randomly divided in two control and
   intervention groups (60 samples in each group). Intervention group
   received one motivational interview session for 120 min, two
   consultation sessions with expert for nutritional recommendations based
   on Nutrition Guidelines of Ministry of Health for Pregnant Women. They
   were also theoretically and practically provided by three training
   sessions for physical activity and pregnancy exercises combining pelvic
   floor muscles, bodybuilding, muscle strengthening, stretching, and
   relaxation and walking activities. To follow up on the intervention, the
   researcher made a phone call with the participants in intervention group
   every 10 days to two weeks. Pregnancy outcomes were assessed using SPSS
   software.
   Results
   The obtained results showed that there was a significant difference
   between the two groups in maternal complications including gestational
   diabetes, hospitalization due to gestational diabetes, nutritional diet
   for gestational diabetes, pregnancy weight gain and 2-hour post-prandial
   blood glucose test (p <= .01). There was no significant difference in
   terms of demographic, midwifery and metabolic syndrome indices between
   the intervention and control groups.
   Conclusion
   The results of the study indicated that intervention program improved
   the maternal pregnancy outcome such as gestational diabetes and weight
   gain during the pregnancy in the intervention group. This program had no
   adverse effects for the mother who is consistent with pregnancy health
   objectives.}},

Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{The present work focuses on the effect of vanadium dioxide (VO2) films
   exhibiting a metal-insulator transition (MIT) on the performance
   characteristics of the magnetic multilayers. It has been shown that the
   MIT provides a novel mechanism for controlling the microwave spin-wave
   dynamics in the yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films. In particular, the low
   and high levels of microwave attenuation of spin waves transmitted
   through the YIG-VO2 bilayer has been observed due to a variation of the
   VO2 conductivity within a narrow temperature range. This effect has been
   utilized to realize fully reconfigurable magnonic crystals composed of
   the thickness-modulated YIG and regular VO2 films. A promising
   functionality of the proposed waveguiding structures arises from a
   controllability of wave intensity, which provides an altering of the
   frequency response from an original band structure to a full rejection
   of spin waves. Numerical simulations taking into account both the YIG
   film saturation magnetization and the VO2 film conductivity have
   confirmed the experimentally observed spin-wave dynamics. An interest in
   ferrite-VO2 bilayers arises not only from possible practical
   applications but also from a variety of fundamental scientific problems
   devoted to the physics of wave phenomena in planar thin-film magnetic
   multilayers.}},

Title = {{An NLP-SEM approach to examine the gratifications affecting user's
   choice of different e-learning providers from user tweets}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DECISION SYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{In this digital era, it is important for service providers to gain
   insights from the customer-generated data and act accordingly for
   gaining a competitive advantage over competitors. However, there are few
   studies that have attempted at utilising the online user-reviews in
   structural-models for examining the factors affecting user-behaviour.
   Additionally, there is a paucity of studies that have utilised the
   sentiment and emotional aspects to understand the motives affecting
   usage intentions. This study attempts to address this gap by exploring
   various uses and gratifications valued by users for different e-learning
   providers in India, namely, Coursera, Lynda, Udemy, Udacity and Byjus,
   by analysing the tweets posted by users using various official handles.
   Utilising a Natural-Language-Processing (NLP)-based approach (sentiment
   and opinion-mining) and 5868 tweets, the customer motives were analysed
   and mapped to the various gratifications. Results of the natural
   language processing-based structural-equation-modelling (NLP-SEM)
   technique show that consumers of different companies value

   monthly surface temperature time series involves monthly data that

   been discretized to binary data, and the transition probabilities have
   been computed up to the fourth-order Markov chain model. The best order
   of Markov chain has been derived through the minimization of the
   Bayesian information criterion (BIC). By analyzing the time series

Abstract = {{Background High levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) correlate with
   disease severity in COVID-19. We hypothesized that tocilizumab (a
   recombinant humanized anti-IL-6 receptor) could improve outcomes in
   selected patients with severe worsening COVID-19 pneumonia and high
   inflammatory parameters. Methods The TOCICOVID study included a
   prospective cohort of patients aged 16-80 years with severe (requiring >
   6 L/min of oxygen therapy to obtain Sp02 > 94\%) rapidly deteriorating
   (increase by >= 3 L/min of oxygen flow within the previous 12 h)
   COVID-19 pneumonia with >= 5 days of symptoms and C-reactive protein
   levels > 40 mg/L. They entered a compassionate use program of treatment
   with intravenous tocilizumab (8 mg/kg with a maximum of 800 mg per
   infusion; and if needed a second infusion 24 to 72 h later). A control
   group was retrospectively selected with the same inclusion criteria.
   Outcomes were assessed at D28 using inverse probability of treatment
   weighted (IPTW) methodology. Results Among the 96 patients included
   (81\% male, mean (SD) age: 60 (12.5) years), underlying conditions,
   baseline disease severity, and concomitant medications were broadly
   similar between the tocilizumab (n = 49) and the control (n = 47)
   groups. In the IPTW analysis, treatment with tocilizumab was associated
   with a reduced need for overall ventilatory support (49 vs. 89\%, wHR:
   0.39 {[}0.25-0.56]; p < 0.001). Albeit lacking statistical significance,
   there was a substantial trend towards a reduction of mechanical
   ventilation (31\% vs. 45\%; wHR: 0.58 {[}0.36-0.94]; p = 0.026).
   However, tocilizumab did not improve overall survival (wHR = 0.68
   {[}0.31-1.748], p = 0.338). Among the 85 (89\%) patients still alive at
   D28, patients treated with tocilizumab had a higher rate of oxygen
   withdrawal (82\% vs. 73.5\%, wHR = 1.66 {[}1.17-2.37], p = 0.005), with
   a shorter delay before being weaned of oxygen therapy (mean 11 vs. 16
   days; p < 0.001). At D28, the rate of patients discharged from hospital
   was higher in the tocilizumab group (70\% vs. 40\%, wHR = 1.82
   {[}1.22-2.75]; p = 0.003). The levels of CRP and fibrinogen post therapy
   (p < 0.001 for both variables) were significantly lower in the
   tocilizumab group (interaction test, mixed model). Rates of neutropenia
   (35\% vs. 0\%; p < 0.001) were higher in the tocilizumab group, yet
   rates of infections (22\% vs. 38\%, p = 0.089) including
   ventilator-acquired pneumonia (8\% vs. 26\%, p = 0.022) were higher in
   the control group. Conclusion These data could be helpful for the design
   of future trials aiming to counter COVID-19-induced inflammation,
   especially before patients require admission to the intensive care unit.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the molecular dynamics and solidification behavior
   of a 2,3-difluoro-4-propylphenyl
   2,3-difluoro-4-(4-pentylcyclohexyl)benzoate nematic liquid crystal
   (5C4FPB3) observed by broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) and
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Polarized optical microscopy
   (POM) is also performed to confirm the phase transition temperatures.
   Our investigation reveals rare crystallization of the orientationally
   disordered crystal (ODIC) phase from the nematic phase and a glass
   transition of the crystal at cooling rates higher than 1 K min(-1). The
   deconvolution of the dielectric spectra with derivative techniques is
   necessary because of the complex molecular dynamics in the crystalline
   phase. The BDS method enables us to capture the relaxation processes
   reflecting pre-crystallization molecular movements. The kinetics of
   nonisothermal crystallization is studied using the Ozawa, Mo, and
   isoconversional methods. The present studies suggest that the dominant
   factor of the crystal growth mechanism depends on the cooling rate. Two
   types of crystallization mechanisms are identified at cooling rates
   lower and higher than 5 K min(-1). We design a diagram with
   crystallization and glass transition borders against the cooling rates.
   Estimations show that crystallization of the present compound can be
   bypassed at cooling rates higher than 78 kK min(-1), at which a glass
   transition of the nematic phase occurs. We show various scenarios of the
   molecular order and the crystallization mechanism designed based on the
   process rate.}},

Abstract = {{Cu(ii) complexes containing RR- or SS-2,2
   `-isopropylidene-bis(4-phenyl-2-oxazoline) (denoted as {[}Cu(RR- or

   Herein, the source of enantioselectivity was investigated by vibrational
   circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy. An achiral beta-diketonato ligand
   (denoted as LH), such as 1-phenyl-1,3-butanedione and dibenzoylmethane,
   was added to form {[}Cu(RR- or SS-oxa)L](+). Clear VCD peaks were
   obtained from a CDCl3 solution of {[}Cu(RR- or SS-oxa)](2+) or {[}Cu(RR-
   or SS-oxa)L](+) at 1000-1800 cm(-1). It is to be noted that when LH was
   coordinated, a new VCD peak appeared at similar to 1380 cm(-1), which
   was assigned to the C-O asymmetric stretching vibration of L-.
   Theoretical simulation helped rationalise the results in terms of the
   transformation of coordinated L- into a twisted chiral form. The extent
   of steric control within the coordination sphere was demonstrated,
   revealing the first step for enantioselectivity during catalysis.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature is a key parameter for optimal cellular function and growth.
   Temperature perturbation may directly lead to cell death. This can be
   used in cancer therapies to kill cells in tumors, a therapeutic approach
   called hyperthermia. To avoid overheating of tumors that may damage
   healthy tissues, a knowledge of the intracellular temperature reached
   during the hyperthermia treatment of cancer cells is relevant. Recently,
   several luminescent intracellular nanothermometers have been proposed;
   however an application to sense temperature during a hyperthermia
   treatment is lacking. Here we present a technique to measure
   intracellular temperature changes in in vitro cancer cell models. For
   this purpose, we study for the first time the temperature dependence of
   the green fluorescent protein (GFP)'s fluorescence lifetime parameter.
   We find the fluorescence lifetime of GFP can be used for
   nanothermosensing. We use GFP in a bound form to actin filaments as an
   intracellular thermal reporter. Furthermore, we assess intracellular
   temperature during in vitro magnetothermal therapy on live HeLa cells
   incubated with polyacrylic acidcoated iron oxide nanoparticles. Compared
   to other thermosensitive materials and formulations reported so far, the
   GFP nanothermosensor is easily expressed via transfection and various
   GFP variants are commercially available. We foresee that the
   nanothermometer developed might find widespread applications in cancer
   therapy research and development.}},

Title = {{A novel constrained optimization-build method for precision assembly of
   aircraft engine}},
Journal = {{ASSEMBLY AUTOMATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{869-879}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   This paper aims to provide a precision assembly method to improve the
   aircraft engine quality of initial unbalance with the purpose of
   founding the process for mass eccentricity propagation and demonstration
   of assembly process. The proposed method can be used for assembly
   guidance, tolerance allocation and so on, especially for the assembly
   with a large number of rotors and the assembly requirements of initial
   unbalance and coaxiality in high precision.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper proposes a constrained optimization-build method to minimize
   initial unbalance of aircraft engine assembly, which takes amount of
   unbalance and concentricity of each rotor into account. A constrained
   nonlinear programming model is extracted by choosing the initial
   unbalance as the objective function, and choosing the coaxiality and
   assembly orientations as the nonlinear constraints. The initial
   unbalance is reduced stage-by-stage by controlling the assembly angle of
   each rotor.
   Findings
   The validity and accuracy of the proposed method is verified by the
   multistage rotors assembly through experiments run with the measuring
   instruments. Compared with the direct-build method, the initial
   unbalance of final assembly using proposed method is reduced by 22.2\%
   in four rotors assembly.
   Originality/value
   Different from the geometric eccentricity propagation control methods to
   reduce the initial unbalance indirectly, this paper establishes mass
   eccentric propagation model in multistage rotors assembly of aircraft
   engine for the first time. It provides a new idea to establish the
   relationship between the amount of unbalance of each rotor and the
   initial unbalance of multistage rotors.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of various intrinsic point defects in Y3Fe5O12 and their

Journal = {{ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION}},
Abstract = {{Integrating production scheduling with transportation decisions is an
   important problem that is receiving increasing interest from the
   logistics industry. As an order is received, the manufacturer starts
   planning its production while considering the appropriate decisions for
   delivery. The company can adopt an auction paradigm to involve external
   occasional drivers, besides using its own fleet for the delivery. Ahead
   of an auctioning process, the company should decide which deliveries
   should be served by its fleet and which can be assigned to the
   occasional drivers. This is known as the shipper lane selection problem
   (SLSP). This article integrates the SLSP with production scheduling and
   proposes an integer formulation and heuristic methods to solve the
   resulting integrated problem (I-SLSPS). Experiments show the validity of
   the proposed methods and their capability in achieving minimum cost for

Title = {{Required data elements for interprofessional rounds through the lens of
   multiple professions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTERPROFESSIONAL CARE}},
Abstract = {{The lack of a proper system for ongoing open interprofessional
   communication among care providers increases miscommunications and
   medical errors. Seamless access to patient information is important for
   care providers to prevent miscommunication and improve patient safety. A
   shared understanding of the information needs of different care
   providers in an interprofessional team is lacking. Our purpose is to
   identify care providers' information needs from the perspective of
   different professions for communication, shared understanding about the
   patient, and decision-making. We conducted semi-structured interviews
   with 10 subject matter experts representing eight professions, including
   dentistry, dietetics, medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, pharmacy,
   physical therapy, and social work in a 465-bed academic hospital at a
   large urban Midwestern city. We used an in-house rounding tool
   presenting physicians' information needs and a hypothetical patient
   scenario to collect participants' feedback. Interview notes were coded
   using direct content analysis. We identified 22 additional essential
   data elements for an interprofessional rounding tool. We categorized
   those into six domains: discharge-related, social determinants of
   health, hospital safety, nutrition, interprofessional situation
   awareness, and patient history. A well-designed validated rounding tool
   that includes an interprofessional team of care providers' information
   needs could improve communication, care planning, and decision-making
   among them.}},

Title = {{Direct dissolution of UO2 in carboxyl-functionalized ionic liquids in

Abstract = {{Dissolution of UO2 is a prerequisite for the reprocessing of spent
   nuclear fuel. This study showed that UO2 could be directly dissolved in
   a single carboxyl-functionalized ionic liquid (IL), {[}HOOCMmim]{[}Tf2N]
   1-carboxymethyl-3-methylimidazolium bistriflimide, or
   {[}HOOCEtmim]{[}Tf2N] 1-carboxyethyl-3-methylimidazolium bistriflimide.
   The addition of an extra Fe-containing IL, {[}Emim]{[}FeCl4] (Emim,
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium) or {[}Bmim]{[}FeCl4] (Bmim,
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium) could significantly improve the dissolution
   kinetics. Results demonstrated that the dissolution process in the early
   stage could be described by using the pseudo first-order rate law. The
   apparent activation energy for UO2 dissolution in the mixture of the
   Fe-containing IL and carboxyl-functionalized IL was calculated to be
   similar to 67 kJ mol(-1), implying that the reaction was mainly
   controlled by a chemical process. Nevertheless, the influence of the
   diffusion process is non-negligible since the IL has a relatively high
   viscosity that can retard the diffusion of the formed uranyl species
   from the UO2 surface. Spectroscopic studies and density functional
   theory calculations indicated that the uranyl ion coordinated with
   carboxylate groups is the predominant product for UO2 dissolution in the
   single carboxyl-functionalized IL, while uranyl chloride complexes would
   also form in the mixed ILs. The dissolved uranyl species can be
   successfully recovered from the ILs by extraction. The success of UO2
   dissolution in the carboxyl-functionalized IL with or without the
   Fe-containing IL indicates that the Fe-containing IL and oxygen can
   serve as an effective catalyst and oxidant for the dissolution of UO2,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This study presented two Chinese adult female patients who were
   diagnosed with adult-onset Krabbe disease (KD) and reviewed this disease
   in Chinese patients. Two young female adults in their 20s were enrolled
   in this study. Clinical data, including symptoms, magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) scanning, and laboratory studies were collected. Sequence
   alignment and structural modeling were carried out to analyze the
   pathogenesis of the disease. Both patients were adult-onset and both had
   a mild clinical course, presented with spastic weakness. The MRI study
   showed demyelination confined to the corticospinal tracts and
   parieto-occipital white matter. The beta-galactocerebrosidase (GALC)
   activity was obviously decreased in both patients. Gene test of GALC
   showed that both patients were compound heterozygotes; proband I was a
   carrier of p.L634S (c.1901 T > C) and p.I250T (c.749 T > C), while
   proband II was a carrier of p.L634S (c.1901 T > C) and a new variant of
   c.283\_284del. Molecular analysis revealed the variants may influence
   the function of GALC. We provided two Chinese adult-onset KD, and the
   clinical and genetic characteristics of proband II was especially rare
   due to asymmetric symptoms, spinal cord involvement, and the
   identification of a new point mutation c.283\_284del in the GALC gene.
   Variant c.749 T > C can present mild syndromes except for severe cases.
   c.283\_284del is a new variant that may occur in adult-onset type.}},

Abstract = {{The detailed picture of the microscopic mechanism for CO2 capture in
   N-isopropylethylenediamine (i-2) functionalized M-2(dobpdc) (dobpdc(4-)
   = 4,4 `-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3 `-dicarboxylate; M = Mg, Sc-Zn) has been
   determined for the first time via systematic computations with van der
   Waals (vdW) corrected density functional theory (DFT) methods. The
   results show that acting as a Lewis base, the i-2 molecule can strongly
   interact with the acidic open metal sites of M-2(dobpdc) via its primary
   amine with binding energies of 132 to 178 kJ mol(-1) for different
   metals. After exposure to gaseous CO2, CO2 is captured by inserting into
   the metal-N bond. The corresponding CO2 binding energies (43-69 kJ
   mol(-1)) vary depending on the metal centers. i-2-Sc-2(dobpdc) and
   i-2-Mg-2(dobpdc) with high CO2 binding energies have promising potential
   for CO2 capture. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the CO2 capture
   process involves two steps, consisting of simultaneous nucleophilic
   attack of the CO2 onto the metal-bound N atom with proton transfer. This
   results in the formation of a zwitterion intermediate (step1), and then
   rearrangement of the zwitterion intermediate into the final product
   ammonium carbamate (step2). The first step with relatively high barriers
   (0.99-1.49 eV) is rate-determining. The second step with low barriers
   (less than 0.50 eV) can easily occur and will promote the reaction. This
   work uncovers the complicated microscopic mechanism of CO2 capture with
   i-2 functionalized MOFs at the molecular level. This study provides
   fundamental understanding of the adsorption process and insights into
   the design and synthesis of highly efficient CO2 capture materials.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate and update incidence trends of
   soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) and to develop a nomogram to predict
   cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients diagnosed with primary STS of
   the liver.
   Methods: Patients with hepatic STS were extracted from the Surveillance,
   Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Joinpoint regression
   analyses were performed to assess the incidence trends of STS. A
   nomogram was developed based on the independent risk factors chosen by
   Cox regression models. The calibration curve, area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve (AUC), C-index, and decision curve
   analysis (DCA) were used to assess the predictive performance of the
   nomogram.
   Results: The incidence of STS increased between 1994 and 2012. There was
   a sudden decline in the incidence of STS from 2013. The incidence of STS
   was different in distinct races and genders. The nomogram for predicting
   the CSS of hepatic STS according to the independent factors was well
   calibrated and it displayed optimal discrimination power.
   Conclusion: This study highlights that age, sex, tumor size, quality of
   surgery, and histologic subtypes may contribute to the prognosis of
   hepatic STS, and STS may be etiologically distinct and should be
   considered separately in different races and genders.}},

Abstract = {{Two novel coordination polymers (CPs), namely,
   \{{[}Mn-2(HL)(DMF)(2)(H2O)]center dot H2O\}(n) (1) and
   \{{[}Mn-2(HL)(bibp)(H2O)]center dot H2O\}(n) (2) \{H5L = 2,4-di(2 `,5
   `-dicarboxylphenyl)benzoic acid, bibp = 4,4 `-bis(imidazolyl)biphenyl\},
   were prepared under solvothermal conditions by a mixed-ligand strategy.
   The structural analysis shows that 1 has a 2D sheet structure with a
   2-nodal (3,5)-connected \{3.4.5\}\{3(2).4.5.6(2).7(4)\} topology, which
   is further expanded into a 3D supermolecular framework by hydrogen
   bonding between 2D layers, while 2 exhibits a 3D framework with a
   3-nodal (3,3,12)-connected network with a point Schlafli symbol of
   \{3.4.5\}(2)\{3.5(2)\}(2)\{3(2).4(14).5(10).6(26).7(6).8(6).9(2)\}.
   Moreover, temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility and
   magnetization measurements revealed that 1 and 2 show weak
   antiferromagnetic interactions in the Mn chains with different spin
   topologies, which consist of repeating sequences of -J(1)J(2)- for 1 and
   -J(1)J(2)J(3)J(2)- for 2. Meanwhile, their superexchange coupling
   constants obtained using the PHI program further indicate that the
   magnetic interactions have an -AF-AF- repeating sequence for 1 and an
   -F-AF-F-AF- repeating sequence for 2, which are attributed to the
   structural differences of CPs 1 and 2 and are consistent with the
   magnetic results of structural analysis}},

Abstract = {{A polyvinyl alcohol supported zirconium tungstate (ZrW/PVA) composite
   ion exchange membrane has been synthesized by the sol-gel technique. The
   membrane was prepared by blending zirconium tungstate sol into polyvinyl
   alcohol gel which was cross-linked with glutaraldehyde (GA). The
   prepared membrane was analyzed by FT-IR, optical microscopy, SEM, XRD \&
   EDS. The membrane was found to be devoid of any cracks and defects.
   Electrochemical properties which include transport number, ion exchange
   capacity (IEC), and proton conductivity were also measured. An IEC count
   of 0.92 meq.g(-1 )and transport number of 0.88, thus obtained, were
   indicators of good electrochemical properties that shows its potential
   to be used in the direct methanol fuel cell. Moreover, water uptake,
   methanol uptake and chemical resistivity in the acidic and basic medium
   of the prepared membrane have also been assessed. Synthesized membrane
   showed high water holding capacity as compared to Nafion-117. The water
   uptake of ZrW/PVA composite membrane was found to be 114\% which is much
   higher than that of Nafion-117 (29.2\%) {[}18]. The final weight loss of
   the ZrW/PVA composite membrane in acidic medium was 10\%. Oxidative
   stability of the membrane was evaluated by using Fenton's reagent. The
   weight loss in the reagent after 24 h was 17\% without disruption. (C)

Abstract = {{The proper selection of drilling fluids formulations and its treatment
   has always been a challenge and requires a great effort to ensure
   optimum drilling performance. The objective of this paper is to assist
   the mud engineer in selecting the water-based drilling fluid
   formulations that are best suited for a certain application. To achieve
   this target, the field practices were combined with the literature to
   study the most practiced water-based drilling fluid recipes used for
   onshore gas applications in the Middle East (i.e., spud mud,
   high-bentonite spud mud, salt/polymer mud, and high-overbalanced mud).
   From both field practices and deep literature review, it is recommended
   that both spud mud and high-bentonite spud mud be prepared and
   pre-hydrated for 4-6 h before a well spud. Also, it is important to add
   detergents with high-viscosity sweeps to avoid the bit balling and
   maintain the gel strength. While for salt/polymer mud, the regular
   addition of sodium sulfite is necessary for polymers stabilization, and
   the efficient solids control equipment performance is essential. To
   avoid the solids sagging issues associated with drilling high-pressure
   high-temperature deep gas reservoirs, it is recommended to either uses
   sag resistance materials, micronized weighting materials, or a
   combination of different weighting materials. The high-overbalanced mud
   is the most effective and efficient type when drilling a combination of
   natural fractured depleted gas reservoirs with high-pressure gas
   reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants of halal
   meat consumption within Chinese and German Muslims population using the
   Theory of Planned Behavior as a conceptual framework. The role of the
   cultural dimension of individualism/collectivism and materialism is
   explored. A quantitative research methodology using an online
   questionnaire survey was used. Data were collected from 650 consumers
   mainly originating from Turkey and currently living in China and
   Germany. A positive personal attitude toward the consumption of halal
   meat, motivation to comply with others, the perceived control over
   consuming halal meat, and the availability of halal meat predicts the
   intention to eat halal meat among Muslims' consumers. This article
   extends the rare literature analyzing Chinese and German consumers'
   inclination to buy halal food. It also extends the understanding of the
   role of individualism/collectivism and materialism as moderators of
   antecedents of consumers' purchasing intentions for halal meat.}},

Title = {{Association of Early-Life Trauma and Risk of Adverse Cardiovascular

Abstract = {{Question Among individuals with a history of acute myocardial
   infarction, are those who had a past exposure to adverse childhood
   experiences at higher risk of adverse outcomes than those without such
   exposure? Findings In this cohort study of 300 individuals with a
   history of myocardial infarction and exposure to higher levels of
   early-life trauma, there was a 2-fold increased incidence of adverse
   cardiovascular outcomes compared with those with lower exposure. The
   association was independent of other risk factors and was dose
   dependent. Meaning Individuals with a history of myocardial infarction
   and early-life trauma may be at increased long-term risk of adverse
   cardiovascular outcomes.
   Importance Compared with older patients, young adults with a history of
   myocardial infarction (MI) tend to have a higher burden of psychosocial
   adversity. Exposure to early-life stressors may contribute to the risk
   of adverse outcomes in this patient population, potentially through
   inflammatory pathways. Objective To investigate the association of
   early-life trauma with adverse events and examine whether inflammation
   plays a role. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study
   included patients aged 18 to 60 years with a verified history of MI in
   the past 8 months from a university-affiliated hospital network.
   Baseline data were collected from June 2011 to March 2016, and follow-up
   data were obtained through July 2019. Analysis began September 2019.
   Exposures Early-life trauma was assessed using the Early Trauma
   Inventory-Self Report short form (ETI-SR-SF), both as a continuous and
   as a binary variable at the threshold of a score of 7 or higher.
   Inflammatory biomarkers, interleukin 6, and C-reactive protein were
   obtained at baseline. Main Outcomes and Measures A composite end point
   of recurrent MI, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and
   cardiovascular death over a median 3-year follow-up. Results Of 300
   patients, the mean (SD) age was 51 (7) years, 198 (66\%) were African
   American, and 150 (50\%) were women. Compared with participants with MI
   with an ETI-SR-SF score less than 7, those with a score of 7 or higher
   had higher levels of interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein at baseline.
   Compared with participants with an ETI-SR-SF score less than 7, those
   with a score of 7 or higher were at a greater risk for adverse outcomes,
   with a hazards ratio of 2.3 (95\% CI, 1.3-3.9). Results remained
   consistent in multivariable analysis. Further adjustment for C-reactive
   protein rendered the results no longer statistically significant.
   Early-life trauma displayed a dose-dependent response when analyzed as a
   continuous variable and by quartiles. Conclusions and Relevance
   Early-life trauma is an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes in
   young and middle-aged individuals with a history of MI. Neurobiological
   mechanisms leading to lifetime activation of systemic inflammatory
   cascades may be implicated.
   This cohort study investigates the association of early-life trauma with
   adverse events and examines whether inflammation plays a role.}},

Abstract = {{Background The efficacy of sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) on patients
   with chronic refractory slow-transit constipation is controversial and
   its mechanism of action on gastrointestinal motility and transit is not
   fully understood. The aim of this study was to document the effects of
   temporary SNS on the gastrointestinal and biliary tract motility and on
   gastrointestinal transit in patients with refractory slow-transit
   constipation. Methods This was a prospective interventional study.
   Patients with slow-transit chronic constipation, unresponsive to any
   conservative treatment, were enrolled between January 2013 and December
   2018. Patients' quality of life {[}patient assessment of constipation
   quality of life (PAC-QOL) questionnaire], constipation scores (Cleveland
   Clinic Constipation Score) colonic transit time (CTT), orocecal transit
   time (OCTT), gastric and gallbladder kinetics, together with the
   assessment of the autonomic nerve function were evaluated before and
   during temporary SNS. Results 14 patients (12 females, median age 38
   years, range 24-42 years) had temporary SNS. The Cleveland Clinic
   Constipation Score did not change compared to baseline (23 +/- 3 vs
   21.4; p = 070). The PAC-QOL did not improve significantly during the
   stimulation period. Gallbladder/stomach motility (half-emptying time)
   did not change significantly before and after SNS. OCTT was delayed at
   baseline, as compared to standard internal normal values, and did not
   change during SNS. CTT did not improve significantly, although in two
   patients it decreased substantially from 97 to 53 h, and from 100 to 65
   h. Conclusions Temporary SNS did not have any effect on upper/lower
   gastrointestinal motility and transit in patients with severe
   constipation.}},

Title = {{Trade and FDI thresholds of CO2 emissions for a Green economy in
   sub-Saharan Africa}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   This study aims to focus on assessing how improving openness influences
   carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study focusses on 49 countries in SSA for the period 2000-2018
   divided into: 44 countries in SSA for the period 2000-2012; and 49
   countries for the period 2006-2018. Openness is measured in terms of
   trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. The empirical
   evidence is based on the generalised method of moments.
   Findings
   The following main findings are established. First, enhancing trade
   openness has a net positive impact on CO2 emissions, while increasing
   FDI has a net negative impact. Second, the relationship between CO2
   emissions and trade is a Kuznets shape, while the nexus between CO2
   emissions and FDI inflows is a U-shape. Third, a minimum trade openness
   (imports plus exports) threshold of 100 (\% of gross domestic product
   (GDP)) and 200 (\% of GDP) is beneficial in promoting a green economy
   for the first and second samples, respectively. Fourth, FDI is
   beneficial for the green economy below critical masses of 28.571 of net
   FDI inflows (\% of GDP) and 33.333 of net FDI inflows (\% of GDP) for
   first and second samples, respectively. It follows from findings that
   while FDI can be effectively managed to reduce CO2 emissions, this may
   not be the case with trade openness because the corresponding thresholds
   for trade openness are closer to the maximum limit.
   Originality/value
   This study complements the extant literature by providing critical
   masses of trade and FDI that are relevant in promoting the green economy
   in SSA.}},

Title = {{Long-range ballistic transport of Brown-Zak fermions in graphene
   superlattices}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{In quantizing magnetic fields, graphene superlattices exhibit a complex
   fractal spectrum often referred to as the Hofstadter butterfly. It can
   be viewed as a collection of Landau levels that arise from quantization
   of Brown-Zak minibands recurring at rational (p/q) fractions of the
   magnetic flux quantum per superlattice unit cell. Here we show that, in
   graphene-on-boron-nitride superlattices, Brown-Zak fermions can exhibit
   mobilities above 10(6)cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) and the mean free path exceeding
   several micrometers. The exceptional quality of our devices allows us to
   show that Brown-Zak minibands are 4q times degenerate and all the
   degeneracies (spin, valley and mini-valley) can be lifted by exchange
   interactions below 1K. We also found negative bend resistance at 1/q
   fractions for electrical probes placed as far as several micrometers
   apart. The latter observation highlights the fact that Brown-Zak
   fermions are Bloch quasiparticles propagating in high fields along
   straight trajectories, just like electrons in zero field. Here, the
   authors show that Brown-Zak fermions in graphene-on-boron-nitride
   superlattices exhibit mobilities above 10(6)cm(2)/V s and micrometer
   scale ballistic transport.}},

   time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) correlated with
   cytotoxicity. Liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution tandem
   mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) data from ethyl acetate extracts were
   acquired and processed to generate a massive molecular network (MN)
   using the MetGem software. From five Colletotrichum strains producing
   cytotoxic specialized metabolites, we predicted the occurrence of
   peptide and cytochalasin analogues in four of them by MN, including a
   similar ion clusters in the MN algorithm provided by MetGem software.
   Chemoinformatics predictions were fully confirmed after isolation of
   three pentacyclopeptides (cyclo(Phe-Leu-Leu-Leu-Val),
   cyclo(Phe-Leu-Leu-Leu-Leu) and cyclo(Phe-Leu-Leu-Leu-Ile)) and two
   cytochalasins (cytochalasin C and cytochalasin D) exhibiting

   of four colletamides bearing an identical decadienamide chain.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research efforts to combat marine biofouling have focused on
   foul-release coatings that are not harmful for the marine environment.
   Inspired by nature, Slippery lubricant infused porous surfaces (SLIPS)
   is a surface modification technolo platform with excellent antiadhesive
   and antifouling capacities. Precommercial coatings based on the SLIPS
   concept have demonstrated promising results as an environmentally
   friendly strategy to combat marine biofouling. Here, we investigated the
   resistance against marine biofouling of a range of recently developed,
   biocide-free SLIPS commercial coatings. The fouling resistance
   performance was evaluated both in the lab and in the field by conducting
   multimonth immersion tests in high-fouling pressure environments. In the
   lab, we show that the coatings are able to largely deter settlement of
   marine mussels-one of the most invasive marine biofouling organisms-and
   to weaken their interfacial adhesion strength. The key design parameter
   of slippery coatings to minimize fouling is the thickness of the
   entrapped lubricant overlayer, which can be assessed through
   depth-sensing nanoindentation measurements. We find that the surface
   energy (i.e., hydrophobic versus hydrophilic), on the other hand, does
   not significantly influence the antifouling performance of these
   coatings in lab-scale studies. After immersion in the field in stagnant
   waters, all coatings exhibited efficient foul-release capacity against
   macrofoulers, whereas under stronger hydrodynamic flow conditions, only
   weakly attached biofilms were detected with a bacterial community
   composition that is independent of the surface energy. These results
   suggest that these large-scale paintable coatings exhibit a strong
   marine biofouling resistance with low maintenance costs, which
   represents an important advantage from a commercial application
   perspective.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years there has been an explosion of interest in Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) both in health care and academic philosophy. This has
   been due mainly to the rise of effective machine learning and deep
   learning algorithms, together with increases in data collection and
   processing power, which have made rapid progress in many areas. However,
   use of this technology has brought with it philosophical issues and
   practical problems, in particular, epistemic and ethical. In this paper
   the authors, with backgrounds in philosophy, maternity care practice and
   clinical research, draw upon and extend a recent framework for shared
   decision-making (SDM) that identified a duty of care to the client's
   knowledge as a necessary condition for SDM. This duty entails the
   responsibility to acknowledge and overcome epistemic defeaters. This
   framework is applied to the use of AI in maternity care, in particular,
   the use of machine learning and deep learning technology to attempt to
   enhance electronic fetal monitoring (EFM). In doing so, various
   sub-kinds of epistemic defeater, namely, transparent, opaque,
   underdetermined, and inherited defeaters are taxonomized and discussed.
   The authors argue that, although effective current or future AI-enhanced
   EFM may impose an epistemic obligation on the part of clinicians to rely
   on such systems' predictions or diagnoses as input to SDM, such
   obligations may be overridden by inherited defeaters, caused by a form
   of algorithmic bias. The existence of inherited defeaters implies that
   the duty of care to the client's knowledge extends to any situation in
   which a clinician (or anyone else) is involved in producing training
   data for a system that will be used in SDM. Any future AI must be
   capable of assessing women individually, taking into account a wide
   range of factors including women's preferences, to provide a holistic
   range of evidence for clinical decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{This paper conducts a systematic study on the role of spatial and
   temporal attention mechanism in the video salient object detection
   (VSOD) task. We present a two-stage spatial-temporal attention network,
   named STA-Net, which makes two major contributions. In the first stage,
   we devise a Multi-Scale-Spatial-Attention (MSSA) module to reduce
   calculation cost on non-salient regions while exploiting multi-scale
   saliency information. Such a sliced attention method offers an
   individual way to efficiently exploit the high-level features of the
   network with an enlarged receptive field. The second stage is to propose
   a Pyramid-Saliency-Shift-Aware (PSSA) module, which puts emphasis on the
   importance of dynamic object information since it offers a valid shift
   cue to confirm salient object and capture temporal information. Such a
   temporal detection module is able to encourage precise salient region
   detection. Exhaustive experiments show that the proposed STA-Net is
   effective for video salient object detection task, and achieves
   compelling performance in comparison with state-of-the-art.}},

   congeners, except Hylopanchax paucisquamatus, by the presence of
   vertebrae (30 vs. 31-33) and is further distinguished from H.
   multisquamatus by the presence of a deeper caudal peduncle and much
   larger anterior flank scales. It is distinguished from H. paucisquamatus

Abstract = {{In this work, the CuAlBe shape memory alloy (SMA) with a new composition
   of 77.05Cu-22.02Al-0.93Be (at.\%) detected by the EDS test was
   fabricated in a vacuum arc melter under a pure argon atmosphere. At the
   beginning, the high-purity (\%99.9) elements of Cu, Al, and Be powders
   were mixed and the mixture (similar to 10 g) was formed as pellets by
   pressure. By melting the pellets in arc melter, the as-cast ingot alloy
   was obtained. Then, the ingot alloy was cut into small pieces (similar
   to 30-50 mg) and then all of these samples were all homogenized in the
   beta-phase region (at 900 degrees C for 1 h) and immediately submerged
   in traditional iced-brine water to form beta 1' martensite phase in the
   alloy which results from such fast cooling by suppressing the formation
   of hypoeutectoid precipitations (alpha and gamma 2). Then, to uncover
   and evaluate the existence of martensite structure and the
   characteristics of shape memory alloy properties of the alloy, the
   specimens were tested by calorimetric and structural measurements. The
   results of thermal heating/cooling cycles of the alloy were obtained
   from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements that were
   taken twice at 5 degrees C/min of heating/cooling rate under constant
   argon gas flow (100 ml/min) and by using liquid nitrogen cooling support
   to reach lower temperatures than room temperature. The DSC thermograms
   of the alloy revealed the characteristic martensitic transformation
   peaks that occurred endothermic by heating and exothermic by cooling at
   moderate temperatures ranging between 19 and 66 degrees C, regarded as
   evidence for the presence of shape memory effect property in the alloy.
   Important thermodynamical parameters such as transformation
   temperatures, hysteresis gap, and entropy and enthalpy change amounts
   for these back and forward martensitic phase transition peaks were
   determined directly by using data of DSC peak analyses and by
   calculation. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) measurement that was
   taken from room temperature to 900 degrees C at a heating/cooling rate
   of 25 degrees C/min displayed a high-temperature behavior of the alloy
   as compatible with the common behavior of Cu-Al SMAs. The X-ray test of
   the alloy conducted at room conditions showed sharp diffraction peaks
   and their matching crystal planes which indicate the existence of beta 1
   ` martensite phase in the alloy and its high single-like crystallinity
   i.e. its large Debye-Scherrer sub-micrometer crystallite size. Besides,
   theoretical forecasting about the existence and volumetric dominance of
   martensite phases was deduced from the calculated value of e/a (average
   conduction electron concentration per atom) parameter of the alloy.
   Furthermore, the mechanical Vickers microhardness tests that were
   performed at room temperature and under 100-gf load applied for 10 s
   revealed the high ductility and softness features of the alloy.
   Considering all the results, the highly ductile CuAlBe alloy with new
   composition owing shape memory alloy properties and intermediate working
   temperatures can be useful in various kinds of research and applications
   in which Cu-based SMAs are exploited.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial diseases are common in ornamental fish, more frequently
   associated with ubiquitous bacteria from the aquarium environment. The
   disease can lead to fish mortality and cause high economic losses if not
   rapidly controlled. The aim of this study was to identify the main
   causative bacterial agents of infection in ornamental fish with
   different clinical signs. A total of 126 freshwater fish, from 12
   families and 38 species, with clinical signs were collected in a
   wholesaler in Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil. Samples were taken from the eye,
   skin ulcers, kidneys, and gills, plated on MacConkey, CHROMagar
   Orientation, and blood agar and incubated under aerobic and anaerobic
   conditions. Bacterial identification was performed by MALDI-TOF mass
   spectrometry. From the 126 studied animals, 112 were positive for
   bacterial isolation. Among the positive animals, 32.1\% presented
   infection caused by a single bacterial species, while in the remaining
   67.9\%, two to six different bacterial species were identified. A total
   of 259 bacterial strains were obtained and classified among 46 bacterial
   species. The species of higher frequency were Aeromonas veronii
   (26.3\%), Aeromonas hydrophilla (16.2\%), Shewanella putrefaciens
   (7.3\%), Citrobacter freundii (8.1\%), Vibrio albensis (5.8\%), and
   Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.2\%). MALDI-TOF MS showed to be a rapid method
   for diagnosis of bacterial disease outbreaks in ornamental fish

Abstract = {{Caseous lymphadenitis (CL) in sheep is a chronic contagious disease
   caused by Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, commonly characterized by
   abscess formation in peripheral lymph nodes and disseminated infections.
   Nonetheless, other microorganisms, including with zoonotic relevance,
   can be isolated from CL-resembling lymph nodes. Currently, mycobacteria
   have been reported in visceral granulomatous lesions in small ruminants,
   a fact that poses a public health issue, particularly in slaughtered
   sheep intended for human consumption. Cytology using fine needle
   aspiration and microbiological culturing are suitable tests for routine
   diagnostic, whereas present drawbacks and molecular methods have been
   confirmatory. Data about the occurrence of mycobacteria in both lymph
   nodes with aspect of CL and apparently healthy visceral nodes of sheep
   slaughtered for human consumption are scarce. In this study, 197
   visceral lymph nodes of sheep showed lymphadenitis and 202 healthy
   visceral lymph nodes of slaughtered sheep intended for human consumption
   were submitted to conventional bacteriological diagnosis, mycobacteria
   culturing, and cytological evaluation. Compatible Corynebacterium
   isolates were subjected to multiplex PCR targeting 16S rRNA, rpoB, and
   pld genes to detect C. pseudotuberculosis. Based on microbiological
   identification, C. pseudotuberculosis (86/197; 43.7\%), streptococci
   gamma-hemolytic (17/197; 8.6\%), and Trueperella pyogenes (12/197;
   6.1\%) were prevalent in lymph nodes with abscesses, as opposed to
   staphylococci (53/202; 26.2\%) in apparently healthy lymph nodes. No
   mycobacteria were isolated. Cytology identified 49.2\% (97/197)
   Gram-positive pleomorphic organisms (coryneform aspect). Multiplex PCR
   confirmed genetic material of C. pseudotuberculosis in 74.4\% (64/86) of
   the samples with C. pseudotuberculosis isolation and 66\% (64/97)
   samples with cytological coryneform aspect (kappa = 86.78\%; 95\% CI =
   79.87-93.68\%). These findings emphasize the prevalence of C.
   pseudotuberculosis in abscess formation among peripheral lymph nodes of
   sheep. Other bacteria were also identified in lymph nodes sampled that
   resembling C. pseudotuberculosis-induced infections that may difficult
   the diagnosis. Multiplex PCR revealed a valuable assay to detect C.
   pseudotuberculosis, in addition to routine methods applied to
   CL-diagnosis. No mycobacteria were identified in lymph nodes sampled,
   with and without apparent lesions. Nonetheless, due to public health
   impacts, this pathogen should be considered as a differential diagnosis
   of C. pseudotuberculosis-induced infections during inspection procedures
   of slaughtered sheep intended for human consumption.}},

Title = {{Perception and Attitudes Toward PPE-Related Waste Disposal Amid COVID-19
   in Bangladesh: An Exploratory Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Personal protective equipment (PPE) is an essential item to protect from
   exposure to infectious pathogens or contaminants, which is frequently
   used at health care settings and public spheres since the coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. There is no prior study investigating
   public perception and attitudes toward PPE-related waste disposal in
   Bangladesh. Hence, an online survey was carried out among 1,303
   Bangladeshi adult residents to explore the issue. Results stated that
   face mask and hand gloves were the widely used PPE, where around 45.50\%
   mask and 31.60\% hand gloves were disposable. Approximately 94.50\% of
   the participants percepted to use at least one type of PPE while going
   outside. Only 18.65\% of the respondents percepted to burn the
   PPE-related waste, while most of them reported other less protective
   disposal measures. Females, urban residents, and participants with
   higher education were found to have better perception and attitudes
   toward PPE-related waste disposal. To the best of the authors'
   knowledge, being the first exploratory study in the country, the present
   findings are anticipated to be helpful at policy levels with respect to
   arranging awareness programs.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Aim Woody plants vary greatly from tall trees to branching shrubs with
   increasing dryness. Variation in plant allometry is driven by both
   biotic and abiotic factors, reflecting different plant adaptation
   strategies in different environments. Here, we explore how aboveground
   allometry of different woody plants responds to increasing dryness along
   an extensive aridity gradient.
   Location Eastern Australia.
   Time period 2018-2019.
   Major taxa studied Woody plants.
   Methods We surveyed the aboveground allometry of woody plants (e.g.,
   canopy, height, stem diameter, branches) at 150 sites along a 1,500-km
   aridity gradient from humid to arid areas. We used regression analyses
   and structural equation modelling to explore the variation in woody
   allometry with increasing aridity, and the abiotic (resource
   availability) and biotic (aboveground competition) mechanisms driving
   such changes.
   Results Plant height declined, but branching, canopy width and canopy
   depth increased with increasing aridity. Woody responses to dryness
   varied among genera, with increasing aridity associated with wider
   canopies in Eucalyptus and Callitris spp., thicker stems in Acacia spp.,
   but no clear differences in Allocasuarina spp. Biotic and abiotic
   factors exerted different effects on the allometry of different genera,
   with Eucalyptus and Callitris spp. constrained by resource availability,
   while Acacia and Allocasuarina spp. were regulated mainly by aboveground
   competition.
   Main conclusions As aridity increased, we found genus-specific responses
   in allometric changes and driving mechanisms (resource availability cf.
   aboveground competition). Rather than merely shrinking in size, our
   results suggest that woody plants allocate resources to either canopies
   or stems to cope with increasing dryness. Increasing stem or canopy
   size, and altering branching might be a useful strategy for woody plants
   to compensate for biomass reduction and maintain functions while growing
   shorter under hotter and drier climates.}},

Title = {{Executive function in children with sickle cell anemia on transfusion:
   NIH toolbox utility in the clinical context}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGIST}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   The aim of this study was to establish the utility of the NIH Toolbox as
   a cognitive screener of executive functions in the clinical context.
   Additionally, we aimed to investigate whether age and time on
   transfusion were related to executive function performance. Method:
   Twenty-eight children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia (SCA)
   between 8 and 18 years (M = 13.28, SD = 3.05) on transfusion treatment
   were included. Participants completed five NIH Toolbox tasks (three
   executive function tasks and two non-executive function control tasks).
   Results: Mean scores on one of the three executive function measures
   (inhibitory control) fell below the average range (M = 81.36, SD =
   14.01) with approximately 70\% of children from both groups below the
   average range. Scores for processing speed (M = 86.82, SD = 22.01) and
   cognitive flexibility (M = 85.75, SD = 12.67) were low averages. As
   expected, scores on non-executive measures (language and memory) fell
   within the average range. No significant differences were observed
   between children with silent stroke and no stroke on executive function
   measures. Older age (p < .01) and length of time on transfusion (p <
   .05) predicted lower inhibitory control scores. Conclusions: Findings
   provide evidence for poor development of inhibitory control with age in
   this patient population. As the NIH Toolbox successfully highlighted
   expected deficits in this patient population, this study supports the
   use of this tool as a brief screening measure for children with SCD. The
   clinical and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.}},

Journal = {{ACS APPLIED POLYMER MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{4647-4657}},

Abstract = {{Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) are two
   immiscible polymers which are biodegradable and bioabsorbable, being
   therefore widely applied for medical materials. The formation of
   homogeneous fibers of PCL by electrospinning represents a difficult task
   due to the low viscosity of the solutions of this polymer in comparison
   to the PLA solutions. In addition, the development of simple techniques
   for the characterization of these systems represents a field of
   interest. In this paper, nanofibers of PLA/PCL (1:1 w/w) in a CHCl3:MeOH
   (3:1 w/w) solvent system with and without
   4-{[}4-(dimethylamino)styryl]-1-methylpyridinium iodide (DSMI), a
   perichromic dye, were electrospun. The electrospun nanofibers obtained
   present a homogeneous diameter distribution, with average of 874 +/- 205
   nm in optimization condition for PLA/PCL and 627 +/- 199 nm for
   PLA/PCL/DSMI. The analysis of the differences in the fluorescence
   emission of DSMI distributed in each polymer of the nanofibers allowed
   the direct investigation of the polymeric domains. It is proposed that
   these emission differences result from the preferential stabilization of
   resonant forms of the dye with each polymeric chain. For the PLA-DSMI
   system, green emission was observed, while for PCL-DSMI, red emission
   occurred. The fluorescence results corroborated thermal analyses, where
   the absence of solvents was possible to confirm. The nanofibers were
   compared with the dye anchored in an xerogel, which did not exhibit
   different emission regions due to its homogeneous distribution in the
   matrix.}},

   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database analysis}},
Journal = {{MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{46}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Patients diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma (ES) usually experience poor
   outcomes. Accurate prediction of ES patients' prognosis is essential to
   improve their survival. Given that ES is a relatively rare tumor with a
   low incidence, we aim at developing a prognostic nomogram of ES patients
   based on a large sample analysis. We used the Surveillance,
   Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to screen eligible
   patients diagnosed ES of bone. This retrospective study presented the
   clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of ES. We randomly
   assigned all ES patients to 2 sets (training set and validation set)
   with an equal number of patients. In order to identify independent
   factors of survival, we performed univariate and multivariate Cox
   analysis in the training set. Then, we constructed novel nomograms to
   predict survival of ES patients by integrating significant independent
   variables from the training set. The prognostic performance of
   constructed nomograms was examined using concordance index (C-index) and
   calibration curves in both training and validation set. We included a
   total of 988 eligible cases diagnosed ES of bone between 2000 and 2015.
   Age >18 years, distant metastasis, tumor size >10 cm, and no surgery
   were independent risk factors for poorer survival. Our survival
   prediction nomograms were established based on those 4 independent risk
   factors. Good calibration plots were achieved in internal and external
   validation. The internal validation C-indexes of the nomogram for
   overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were 0.733 and
   0.737, respectively. Similar good results were also achieved in external
   validation setting. The established nomograms show good performance and
   allow for better evaluating the prognosis of ES patients and
   recommending appropriate instructions.}},

   film. Antimicrobial sensitivity test using microdilution and diffusion
   test revealed positive response in Escherichia coli, Salmonella
   enterica, and Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory
   concentration, 7.5 +/- 2, 5.8 +/- 2, and 4.7 +/- 1 mg/ml, respectively,
   but had a negative response for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Listeria
   monocytogenes. HPLC analysis revealed that caffeic, chlorogenic, and
   neochlorogenic acids are the main chemical compounds found in potato
   peel extract and responsible for its antimicrobial property. The
   scavenging ability and phenolic content in the active film range from 10
   to 22 mg GAE/g of the dried film with 24\%-55\% of inhibition,
   respectively. The scanning electron microscope of the starch film showed
   homogeneously and ordered structure; however, some cracks and pores
   shown in the active film. The simulation experiment of phenols migration
   from the film into fatty and aqueous foods showed higher concentration
   in aqueous and less in the fatty foods. Therefore, potato peel extract
   has antibacterial as well as antioxidant property and incorporating with
   potato starch produce an active film which can be used as an alternative
   technology for active food packaging.}},

Title = {{Changes in care-seeking for common childhood illnesses in the context of
   Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) program implementation in
   Benishangul Gumuz region of Ethiopia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) is a strategy for promoting
   access of under-served populations to lifesaving treatments through
   extending case management of common childhood illnesses to trained
   frontline health workers. In Ethiopia iCCM is provided by health
   extension workers (HEWs) deployed at health posts. We evaluated the
   association between the implementation of iCCM program in Assosa Zuria
   zone, Benishangul Gumuz region and changes in care-seeking for common
   childhood illnesses.
   Methods
   We conducted a pre-post study without control arm to evaluate the
   association of interest. The iCCM program that incorporated training,
   mentoring and supportive supervision of HEWs with community-based demand
   creation activities was implemented for two years (2017-18). Baseline,
   midline and endline surveys were completed approximately one year apart.
   Across the surveys, children aged 2-59 months (n = 1,848) who recently
   had cough, fever or diarrhea were included. Data were analysed using
   mixed-effects logistic regression model.
   Results
   Over the two-year period, care-seeking from any health facility and from
   health posts significantly increased by 10.7 and 17.4 percentage points
   (PP) from baseline levels of 64.5 and 34.1\%, respectively (p<0.001).
   Care sought from health centres (p = 0.420) and public hospitals (p =
   0.129) did not meaningfully change while proportion of caregivers who
   approached private (p = 0.003) and informal providers (p<0.001)
   declined. Caregivers who visited health posts for the treatment of
   diarrhea (19.2 PP, p<0.001), fever (15.5 PP, p<0.001), cough (17.8 PP,
   p<0.001) and cough with respiratory difficulty (17.3 PP, p = 0.038)
   significantly increased. After accounting for extraneous variables, we
   observed that care-seeking from iCCM providers was almost doubled
   (adjusted odds ratio = 2.32: 95\% confidence interval; 1.88-2.86) over
   the period.
   Conclusion
   iCCM implementation was associated with a meaningful shift in
   care-seeking to health posts.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate the null-controllability of a nonlinear

   problem, in which singular terms have been removed from the
   nonlinearity. We use spectral techniques and the source-term method to
   deal with the linearized problem and the conclusion follows by virtue of
   a Banach fixed-point argument. The spectral techniques are also used to
   prove a null-controllability result for the linearized thin-film
   equation, a degenerate fourth order analog of the problem under
   consideration.}},

Title = {{Dynamic probabilistic constraints under continuous random distributions}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING}},
Abstract = {{The paper investigates analytical properties of dynamic probabilistic
   constraints (chance constraints). The underlying random distribution is
   supposed to be continuous. In the first part, a general multistage model
   with decision rules depending on past observations of the random process
   is analyzed. Basic properties like (weak sequential) (semi-) continuity
   of the probability function or existence of solutions are studied. It
   turns out that the results differ significantly according to whether
   decision rules are embedded into Lebesgue or Sobolev spaces. In the
   second part, the simplest meaningful two-stage model with decision rules
   from L-2 is investigated. More specific properties like Lipschitz
   continuity and differentiability of the probability function are
   considered. Explicitly verifiable conditions for these properties are
   provided along with explicit gradient formulae in the Gaussian case. The
   application of such formulae in the context of necessary optimality
   conditions is discussed and a concrete identification of solutions
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{This study (a) examined the daily composition of 24-hr movement
   behaviors in children with ASD using objective measures, and (b) applied
   compositional analysis to examine the associations of the time spent in
   moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), light physical activity
   (LPA), sedentary behavior (SB), and sleep duration (SD) with body mass
   index (BMI), relative to the time spent in the other movement behaviors
   in a sample of children (aged 7-19 years) with ASD. Time spent in MVPA,
   LPA, SB, and SD were measured using accelerometers over a 7-day period.
   BMI was calculated from measured height and weight. Participants (n =
   46) spent 40\% of time in LPA (M = 9.6 hr), 30.6\% (M = 7.34 hr) in SB,
   24.9\% (M = 5.98 hr) asleep, and 4.5\% (M = 64.8 min) in MVPA.
   Reallocating 30 min from LPA to SD decreased BMI by 0.471 kg/m(2) (P =
   0.003). Reallocating 30 min from MVPA to SD decreased BMI by 0.658
   kg/m(2) (P = 0.051). Reallocation of 60 min in equal proportions from
   SB, MVPA, and SD to LPA increased BMI by 0.418 kg/m(2) (P = 0.021), and
   reallocation of 60 min in equal proportions from LPA, MVPA, and SD to SB
   increased BMI by 0.295 kg/m(2) (P = 0.052). Finally, reallocation of 60
   min in equal proportions from SB, LPA, and MVPA to SD decreased BMI by

   Lay Summary Data was collected on time spent in light physical activity
   (LPA), moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sedentary behavior
   (SB), and sleep in 46 children with autism. The sample had insufficient
   sleep (a mean of 6 hr/night). We showed that replacing 30 min of LPA or
   MVPA with sleep decreased BMI. Also, moving 60 min to LPA or SB from the
   remaining movement behaviors (i.e., 20 min from each) increased BMI, and
   moving 60 min to sleep from the remaining behaviors decreased BMI.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the increased use of variable renewable energy sources, more
   capacity for reserves is required. Non-generating resources such as
   thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) can arbitrage energy prices and
   provide reserves due to their thermal energy storage capacity. The
   quantity of reserves depends not only on the aggregate power capacity,
   but also on information and communication technology, exogenous
   parameters, and system operator requirements. Specifically, the
   practical limitations origin from (i) communication constraints, (ii)
   ambient temperature, and (iii) the dispatch time of the activation
   signal. This study explores the impact of these parameters on the amount
   of reserves that an aggregator of TCLs can provide to the system
   operator based on centralised control of a TCL population. A decision
   support tool is proposed that can be used by aggregators to decide on
   maximum dispatchable reserve bids. The method can accommodate the
   specific control algorithm and TCL population of an aggregator and is
   based on offline computation. It constitutes a powerful reserve bid
   library to be used when optimisation tools become computationally
   intractable due to the increased number of decentralised flexible loads.}},

Title = {{Maternal and infant hospitalization costs associated with hypertensive
   disorders of pregnancy in a California cohort{*}}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL \& NEONATAL MEDICINE}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The United States has higher health care costs than other developed
   nations. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are increasingly common,
   and longer hospital admissions and utilization of additional therapies
   are costly.
   Objective
   We sought to estimate maternal and neonatal hospital costs in a large
   cohort of pregnant women with and without hypertensive disorders of
   pregnancy.
   Study Design
   This was a retrospective cohort study of women in California with
   singleton, non-anomalous births with gestational ages between 23-42
   weeks. Women were categorized into seven mutually exclusive groups: no
   hypertension, chronic hypertension (HTN), chronic HTN with superimposed
   preeclampsia, gestational HTN, mild preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia,
   and eclampsia. Hospitalization costs were estimated for women and
   neonates separately and included the cost for admission for delivery
   only. We used Chi squared and Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations
   rank tests for statistical analysis with a significance level of 0.05.
   Results
   In a California cohort of 1,918,482 women, 16,208 (0.8\%) had chronic
   HTN, 5,912 (0.3\%) had chronic HTN with superimposed preeclampsia,
   39,558 (2.1\%) had gestational HTN, 33,462 (1.7\%) had mild
   preeclampsia, 17,184 (0.9\%) had severe preeclampsia and 1252 (0.1\%)
   had eclampsia. Median hospitalization costs and length-of-stays were
   statistically significantly different for women in each group (p<.001).
   Women with eclampsia had the highest median hospitalization costs
   (\$25,437, IQR: \$16,893-\$37,261) and women without any hypertensive
   disorder of pregnancy had the lowest (\$11,720, IQR: \$8019-\$17,530).
   Costs were significantly different between groups based on gestational
   age and mode of delivery, and with severe maternal morbidity and
   neonatal intensive care unit admission status (p<.001).
   Conclusions
   We found that hospitalization costs of hypertensive disorders of
   pregnancy were significantly higher than women without hypertension in
   pregnancy. These results highlight the economic burden of hypertensive
   disorders of pregnancy.}},

Title = {{Nineteen-year prognosis in Japanese patients with biopsy-proven

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Many studies have investigated the prognosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver
   disease (NAFLD); however, most studies had a relatively short follow-up.
   To elucidate the long-term outcome of NAFLD, we conducted a
   retrospective cohort study of patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD.
   Methods
   We re-evaluated 6080 patients who underwent liver biopsy from 1975 to
   2012 and identified NAFLD patients without other etiologies. With
   follow-up these patients, we evaluated the outcome-associated factors.
   Results
   A total of 223 patients were enrolled, 167 (74.9\%) was non-alcoholic
   steatohepatitis (NASH). The median follow-up was 19.5 (0.5-41.0) years
   and 4248.3 person-years. The risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and
   hypertension was 11.7 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 8.70-15.6) and
   7.99 (95\% CI 6.09-10.5) times higher, respectively, in NAFLD patients
   than in the general population. Twenty-three patients died, 22 of whom
   had NASH. Major causes of death were extrahepatic malignancy and
   cardiovascular disease (21.7\%) followed by liver-related mortality
   (13.0\%). All-cause mortality was significantly higher in NASH patients
   than in nonalcoholic fatty liver patients (P = 0.041). In multivariate
   analysis, older age (hazard ratio {[}HR] 1.09 {[}95\% CI 1.05-1.14],
   P<0.001) and T2DM (HR 2.87 {[}95\% CI 1.12-7.04], P = 0.021) were
   significantly associated with all-cause mortality. The factors
   significantly associated with liver-related events were older age, T2DM,
   milder hepatic steatosis, and advanced liver fibrosis. Body mass index
   wasn't associated with either mortality or liver-related events.
   Conclusions
   T2DM was highly prevalent in NAFLD patients and was significantly
   associated with both all-cause mortality and liver-related events. The
   lean patients' prognosis wasn't necessarily better than that of
   overweight patients.}},

Title = {{Synergistic effect of silica nanofluid and biosurfactant on bitumen
   recovery from unconventional oil}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DISPERSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the nanofluid (bionanofluid) was prepared by dispersing
   SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) in water (biosurfactant-sophorolipid) solution.
   The nanofluid (bionanofluid) stability was measured through zeta
   potential measurement, DLS (dynamic light scattering) measurement and
   steady-state fluorescence measurement. The critical salt concentration
   (CSC) for bionanofluids was 3\%. The results indicated that sophorolipid
   could improve the nanofluids stability in liquid, and the steady-state
   fluorescence measurement and zeta potential illustrated the sophorolipid
   adhered on the surface of the SiO2 nanoparticles, and then the steric
   hindrance between different nanoparticles increased significantly. It
   was also found that the silica nanoparticles and biosurfactant had
   obvious synergistic effect on bitumen recovery from unconventional oils.
   The nanofluids and bionanofluids viscosities increased with high
   nanoparticles concentration and high salinities. The bionanofluid alter
   the solid wettability from oil-wet to inter medium-wet, the contact
   angle (oil-minerals) increased from 58.5 degrees (in deionized water) to
   87.6 degrees (bionanofluid solution). The bionanofluid could reduce the
   oil-water interfacial tension, and the interfacial tension was lower
   than the surfactant solution used only. The toluene/deionized water
   interfacial tension was 36.1 mN/m, when deionized water was replaced by
   the sophorolipid solution, the interfacial tension was 8.4 mN/m, but the
   interfacial tension of toluene/bionanofluid solution was decreased to
   7.1 mN/m. The similar downward path of interfacial tension occurred when
   the oil phases were cyclohexane, n-heptane and bitumen. The oil/water
   interfacial tension decreased with higher surfactant concentration and
   nanoparticles concentration. In the end, the structural disjoining
   pressure was calculated to explain the synergistic effect. The
   structural adjoining pressure is proportional to the nanofluid velocity
   of enhancing oil (V (C) ). V (C) increased with the decrease diameter of
   nanofluids, but V (C) decreased with the decrease of effective
   nanofluids concentrations. The bionanofluids could decrease the
   nanofluids diameter and increase the nanofluids effective
   concentrations, leading to the increasing of V (C) ,structural adjoining
   pressure and the oil recovery.}},

Abstract = {{A series of hydroxy-functionalized phosphonium salts were studied as
   bifunctional catalysts for the conversion of CO2 with epoxides under
   mild and solvent-free conditions. The reaction in the presence of a
   phenol-based phosphonium iodide proceeded via a first order rection
   kinetic with respect to the substrate. Notably, in contrast to the
   aliphatic analogue, the phenol-based catalyst showed no product
   inhibition. The temperature dependence of the reaction rate was
   investigated, and the activation energy for the model reaction was
   determined from an Arrhenius-plot (E-a=39.6 kJ mol(-1)). The substrate
   scope was also evaluated. Under the optimized reaction conditions, 20
   terminal epoxides were converted at room temperature to the
   corresponding cyclic carbonates, which were isolated in yields up to 99
   \%. The reaction is easily scalable and was performed on a scale up to
   50 g substrate. Moreover, this method was applied in the synthesis of
   the antitussive agent dropropizine starting from epichlorohydrin and
   phenylpiperazine. Furthermore, DFT calculations were performed to
   rationalize the mechanism and the high efficiency of the phenol-based
   phosphonium iodide catalyst. The calculation confirmed the activation of
   the epoxide via hydrogen bonding for the iodide salt, which facilitates
   the ring-opening step. Notably, the effective Gibbs energy barrier
   regarding this step is 97 kJ mol(-1) for the bromide and 72 kJ mol(-1)
   for the iodide salt, which explains the difference in activity.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of Luffa
   cylindrica fibres in a packed bed for the treatment of fish pond
   effluent before releasing into the environment. The fibres were modified
   by mercerisation with 0.5 M NaOH solution. Both modified and unmodified
   fibres were characterised using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
   spectroscopy. Parameters measured were the pH, total dissolved solids
   (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). It was observed
   from the study that a biomass packed bed of modified and unmodified
   Luffa cylindrica fibres was unsuitable in remediating the DO, TDS and
   COD of fish pond effluents. However, the material was suitable in
   remediating the pH, TSS, BOD and colour of the fish pond effluents. The
   process reduced the colour from 9.83 to 7.12 TCU for the modified fibres

Abstract = {{From Sydney Brenner's backyard to hundreds of labs across the globe,
   inspiring six Nobel Prize winners along the way, Caenorhabditis elegans
   research has come far in the past half century. The journey is not over.
   The virtues of C. elegans research are numerous and have been recounted
   extensively. Here, we focus on the remarkable progress made in sensory
   neurobiology research in C. elegans. This nematode continues to amaze
   researchers as we are still adding new discoveries to the already rich
   repertoire of sensory capabilities of this deceptively simple animal.
   Worms possess the sense of taste, smell, touch, light, temperature and
   proprioception, each of which is being studied in genetic, molecular,
   cellular and systems-level detail. This impressive organism can even
   detect less commonly recognized sensory cues such as magnetic fields and
   humidity.}},

Abstract = {{Background: One of the main concerns of public health surveillance is to
   preserve the physical and mental health of older adults while supporting
   their independence and privacy. On the other hand, to better assist
   those individuals with essential health care services in the event of an
   emergency, their regular activities should be monitored. Internet of
   Things (IoT) sensors may be employed to track the sequence of activities
   of individuals via ambient sensors, providing real-time insights on
   daily activity patterns and easy access to the data through the
   connected ecosystem. Previous surveys to identify the regular activity
   patterns of older adults were deficient in the limited number of
   participants, short period of activity tracking, and high reliance on
   predefined normal activity. Objective: The objective of this study was
   to overcome the aforementioned challenges by performing a pilot study to
   evaluate the utilization of large-scale data from smart home thermostats
   that collect the motion status of individuals for every 5-minute
   interval over a long period of time. Methods: From a large-scale
   dataset, we selected a group of 30 households who met the inclusion
   criteria (having at least 8 sensors, being connected to the system for
   at least 355 days in 2018, and having up to 4 occupants). The indoor
   activity patterns were captured through motion sensors. We used the
   unsupervised, time-based, deep neural-network architecture long
   short-term memory-variational autoencoder to identify the regular
   activity pattern for each household on 2 time scales: annual and
   weekday. The results were validated using 2019 records. The area under
   the curve as well as loss in 2018 were compatible with the 2019
   schedule. Daily abnormal behaviors were identified based on deviation
   from the regular activity model. Results: The utilization of this
   approach not only enabled us to identify the regular activity pattern
   for each household but also provided other insights by assessing sleep
   behavior using the sleep time and wake-up time. We could also compare
   the average time individuals spent at home for the different days of the
   week. From our study sample, there was a significant difference in the
   time individuals spent indoors during the weekend versus on weekdays.
   Conclusions: This approach could enhance individual health monitoring as
   well as public health surveillance. It provides a potentially
   nonobtrusive tool to assist public health officials and governments in
   policy development and emergency personnel in the event of an emergency
   by measuring indoor behavior while preserving privacy and using existing
   commercially available thermostat equipment.}},

Abstract = {{The extent to which students' level of depressive and anxiety symptoms

   Students' level of depressive symptoms were predicted by parental
   emotional support and harsh parenting, but not by parental monitoring.
   With the exception of harsh parenting, neither parental emotional
   support nor parental monitoring were significant predictors of the

Abstract = {{In the current investigation, the enrichment of hydrogen with the honge
   biodiesel blend and diesel is used in a compression ignition engine. The
   biodiesel is derived from the honge oil and mixed with diesel fuel by
   20\% (v/v). Thereafter, hydrogen at different volume flow rates (10 and
   13 lpm) is introduced into the intake manifold. The outcomes by
   enrichment of hydrogen on the performance, combustion and emission
   characteristics are investigated by examining the brake thermal
   efficiency, fuel consumption, HC, CO, CO2, NO emissions, in-cylinder
   pressure, combustion duration, and rate of heat release. The engine
   fuelled with honge biodiesel blend is found to enhance the thermal
   efficiency, combustion characteristics. Compare to diesel, the BTE
   increased by 2.2\% and 6\% less fuel consumption for the HB20 + 13H(2)
   blend. Further, reduction in the emission of exhausts gases like CO and
   HC by 21\% and 24\%, respectively, are obtained. This is due to
   carbon-free structure in hydrogen. Moreover, due to high pressure in the
   cylinder, there is a slight increase in oxides of nitrogen emission
   compare to diesel. The combustion characteristics such as rate of heat
   release, combustion duration, and maximum (2)rate of pressure rise and
   in-cylinder pressure are high due to hydrogen. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy

Journal = {{BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{28}},

Pages = {{813-829}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Besides small- and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) constraints,
   there is a lack of critical observations of the human capital model
   naturally inspiring themselves from within. Therefore this paper exposes
   the factors of emotional intelligence (EI) that make entrepreneurs gain
   sustainable competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach A data of
   self-administered survey from 397 SMEs in Malaysia was investigated
   using regression analysis. Findings The results reveal factors of EI
   comprised of self-confidence, self-innovation, self-inspiration and
   self-vision that have significant positive impacts on entrepreneurial
   performance. Amazingly, EI contributes almost 30\% of the success, where
   self-vision and self-innovation are the robust EI to strengthen and
   sustain entrepreneurial performance. In contrast, self-confidence and
   self-inspiration are generic EI of human capital and easy to be applied
   by rivals. Research limitations/implications The study provides a
   comparative benchmark model for SMEs, managers and entrepreneurs
   inspiring themselves from within that they can emulate and attain the
   same success. SMEs can obtain success by investing and culturing EI
   factors within themselves. Practical implications The study provides a
   comparative benchmark model for SMEs and managers inspiring themselves
   from within and expands the theory of heterogeneous SMEs and the human
   capital to sustainable business and competitiveness. SMEs can obtain
   success through capitalizing human capital attributes within themselves.
   Originality/value The study is the first providing the viable model for
   SMEs or entrepreneurs leading themselves from within, to their action,
   behaviour, decision and achievement or the performance mechanism with a
   benchmark model of entrepreneur EI as a booster.}},

Abstract = {{Separation technology using membranes is an effective choice for water
   treatment, but fouling is a significant problem for membrane
   applications. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets have
   been promising for water treatment owing to their good antifouling
   properties compared to other nanosheets such as graphene oxide. However,
   using scalable exfoliation methods for membrane synthesis is still a
   great challenge. Among the various methods adopted to exfoliate
   nanosheets from the bulk, solvent exfoliation is eliciting increased
   interest because of its simplicity and flexibility. Herein, we first
   reported the preparation of solvent-exfoliated WS2 nanosheets for
   achieving polyethersulfone with improved performance as a modified
   membrane. The effects of WS2 nanosheets on the morphology and separation
   efficiency of the prepared membranes were determined in terms of pure
   water permeance and solute rejection. The results indicated that the
   water permeance increased from 200 to 360 L/m(2) h bar with the solute
   rejection rate increasing from 89 to 98\% for bovine serum albumin (BSA)
   and 87-98\% for humic acid at a pH of 10 after the blending of WS2
   nanosheets. The membrane long-term fouling resistance for BSA filtration
   showed the splendid antifouling property of the modified membrane. The
   mechanism for achieving a high rejection rate with a high flux for mixed
   matrix membranes was due to nanosheet-induced surface chemistry
   enhancement. Overall, our findings indicated the potential of the water
   treatment applications of WS2/PES mixed matrix membranes through the
   introduction of transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets.}},

   performance and survival chances. This happens because audiences avoid
   engagement with stigmatized organizations to minimize the probability of
   stigma transfer. Although scholars have explored what strategies
   stigmatized companies undertake to mitigate their stigma, we know very
   little about whether and how audiences' acceptance of stigmatized
   organizations actually happens and if industry-level processes play a
   role in this acceptance. We develop a theory of identity exposure
   predicting that customers will become less concerned about stigma
   transfer when stigmatized organizations unambiguously reveal their
   identities by publicly advocating and celebrating their business and
   when vanguard customers openly discuss stigmatized organizations and
   their products in public forums. We find support for our theorizing in
   the analyses of customers' concerns about stigma in -a marijuana-based
   community-from its inception in 2008 through 2014. Ultimately, our
   findings and extensive robustness checks suggest that identity exposure
   within stigmatized industries can alleviate customers' concerns about
   stigma transfer and in this way accelerate the market destigmatization
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Salinity stress is a critical abiotic stress that reduces crop
   productivity. Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) is an essential
   cereal in Tunisia, a country threatened by salinity stress. In this
   study, 26 accessions of Tunisian durum wheat were subjected to salinity
   stress induced by 500 mM NaCl, and their salinity tolerance was
   evaluated by examining phenotypic parameters and calculating the
   salinity tolerance trait index and salinity tolerance index.
   Furthermore, two Tunisian durum wheat cultivars, namely `Om Rabia'
   (salinity-tolerant) and `Mahmoudi' (salinity-susceptible), were
   subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis, and single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected from the RNA-Seq data of these two
   cultivars. The impacts of all SNP variants on genes were predicted, and
   157 candidate SNP primer pairs were designed preferentially using
   high-impact transcripts. Following confirmation using polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) analysis of data from `Om Rabia' and `Mahmoudi', 17 SNP
   markers were developed and applied to assess the remaining 26 Tunisian
   durum wheat lines. Three developed SNP markers
   (KUCMB\_TRIDC7AG078450.6\_12, KUCMB\_TRIDC2BG061830.1\_05, and
   KUCMB\_TRIDC2BG061830.1\_08) showed PCR bands only in salinity-tolerant
   lines but not in moderately tolerant or susceptible lines. Therefore,
   the developed SNP markers may be used to screen the salinity tolerance
   of various durum wheat accessions.}},

Title = {{Longitudinal analysis of Socioecological obesogenic factors in a

Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Background Childhood obesity is a serious public health threat. Although
   many researchers conducted research on socioecological determinants of
   childhood obesity, their longitudinal effects remain inconclusive
   especially among young children. This study examined socioecological
   factors and associated transitions of children's body mass index (BMI)
   status throughout children's kindergarten to elementary school years,
   using data from a national longitudinal sample. Methods The baseline
   sample of this study included 1264 children (weighted N = 379,297)
   extracted from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (baseline mean
   age: 5.24 years). The socioecological framework guided selection of
   socioecological obesogenic variables (e.g., family activity and parental
   involvement). Longitudinal ordered logistic regressions were performed
   to determine the associations between socioecological obesogenic
   variables and unhealthy/healthy changes in BMI status that captured
   transitions between healthy and unhealthy weight status (i.e.,
   overweight, obesity, and severe obesity). Results Children with Hispanic
   ethnicity and nonwhite, less socioeconomic and environmental support,
   and living in households with fewer family members were more likely than
   their counterparts to have unhealthy BMI status changes over time (all
   ps < 0.05). Over the study period, girls were less likely than boys to
   experience transitions to unhealthy BMI status (all ps < 0.05).
   Conclusion As hypothesized a priori, the findings of the current
   affirmed multiple dimensions of how sociological obesogenic factors may
   influence children's BMI status changes in a longitudinal setting. In
   order to maintain children's long-term healthy weight, more attention
   should be paid to socioeconomic obesogenic factors surrounding children
   as well as individual determinants of obesity (e.g., being physically
   active and having well-balanced nutrition).}},

Title = {{Body awareness in healthy subjects - a qualitative study}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOTHERAPY}},
Abstract = {{Background: Qualitative research concerning body awareness has focused
   on how patients with different diagnosis experience body awareness. No
   earlier study has focused on healthy adults' experiences of body
   awareness.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to explore and describe healthy adults'
   experiences of body awareness.
   Methods: Fifteen healthy informants were interviewed individually, and
   the transcripts were analysed according to qualitative content analysis.
   Results: Three themes describing experiences of body awareness among
   healthy adults: A bodily grounding and identity forming process
   throughout life, Interpersonal relationships through the body, and To be
   visible and exposed in society.
   Conclusions: Body awareness among healthy adults was experienced as a
   bodily and identity forming process throughout life. In this process
   interpersonal relationships were developed through the awareness of the
   body. Body awareness was also experienced as being visible and exposed
   in society. Body awareness was not only related to individuals
   experiences and affects our relations and behaviours from inside and out
   but was also related to group norms and societal norms. This is
   important for health promotion in different contexts in society.}},

Abstract = {{Let G be a bridgeless multigraph with m edges and n(2) vertices of

   is known that if cc(G) < 1.4m, in bridgeless graphs with n(2) <= m/10,
   then the Cycle Double Cover Conjecture holds. Fan (2017) proved that if

   for a bridgeless multigraph with m, edges and n(2) vertices of degree
   two, cc(G) < 1.6148m, + 0.0741n(2). Therefore, if n(2) = 0, then cc(G) <

Title = {{Limited predictive value of admission time in clinical psychiatry}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Background A large proportion of admissions to psychiatric hospitals
   happen as emergency admissions and many of them occur out of core
   working hours (during the weekends, on public holidays and during night
   time). However, very little is known about what determines admission
   times and whether the information of admission time bears any relevance
   for the clinical course of the patients. In other words, do admission
   times correlate with diagnostic groups? Can accumulations of crises be
   detected regarding circadian or weekly rhythms? Can any differences
   between workdays and weekends/public holidays be detected? May it even
   be possible to use information on admission times as a predictor for
   clinical relevance and severity of the presented condition measured by
   the length of stay? Methods In the present manuscript we analyzed data
   derived from 37 ` 705 admissions to the Psychiatric District Hospital of
   Regensburg located in the Southern part of Germany covering the years
   2013 to 2018 with regard to ICD-10 diagnostic groups and admission
   times. The hospital provides 475 beds for in-patient treatment in all
   fields of clinical psychiatry including geriatrics and addiction
   medicine. Results Several core questions could be answered based on our
   analysis: 1st Our analysis confirms that there is a high percentage of
   unheralded admissions out of core time showing broad variation. 2nd In
   contrary to many psychiatrists' misconceptions the time of admission has
   no relevant impact on the length of stay in the hospital. 3rd The
   predictive value of admission time regarding the allocation to ICD-10
   diagnostic groups is low explaining only 1\% of variability. Conclusions
   Taken together, our data reveal the enormous variation of admission
   times of psychiatric patients accounting for the need of adequate and
   consistent provision of personnel and spatial resources.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoplastics and functional polymers are commonly used modifiers for
   epoxy (EP) resin. In this study, an EP system was fabricated and
   modified with methyl methacrylate block copolymer (BMG), polyphenylene
   oxide (PPO) and polysulfone (PSF). This was carried out to study the
   influence of thermoplastic polymers and functional polymers on the
   properties of EP resins, and the performance of the different modified
   EP systems was studied and compared. The curing reaction, rheological
   performances, heat resistance, and mechanical properties of the EP
   blends were investigated. Curing process of EP resin was determined as
   110 degrees C for 1 h and 150 degrees C for 3 h by using non-isothermal
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method. The rheological test
   revealed that the EP/BMG and EP/PPO blends exhibited low viscosity and
   wide processing window compared to the EP/PSF blend, thereby indicating
   good processing performance. The thermal stability of the modified EP
   blends was evaluated by using dynamic mechanical analysis methods. The
   results showed that the glass transition temperature (T-g ) of EP/BMG,
   EP/PPO and EP/PSF blends were 123 degrees C, 129 degrees C, and 131
   degrees C, respectively. BMG showed an excellent toughening effect on EP
   resin compared to PPO and PSF. In addition, the flexural strength and
   impact strength of EP/BMG were 114 MPa and 21.2 kJ/m(2), respectively.
   The influence of polymers on the properties of EP resin stems from their
   molecular structures.}},

Title = {{W states fusion via polarization-dependent beam splitter}},
Journal = {{QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Based on the polarization-dependent beam splitter (PDBS), we propose an
   optical scheme to fuse small-size polarization entangled W states into a
   large-scale W states. With the present scheme, two Wm+n+t-2 states can
   be created from an n-qubit W state, an m-qubit W state and a t-qubit W
   state, and two Wm+n+t+q-3 states can be generated from Wm, Wn, Wt and Wq
   states. In the previous fusion schemes, only one particle from each
   initial W state is allowed to enter the fusion mechanism, but with the
   progress of experimental technology, two particles can be extracted. In
   this case, the W states fusion of our scheme will be realized without
   any ancillary particles and controlled quantum gate. In addition,
   compared with the one target W state obtained in previous preparation
   schemes, our scheme can generate two large-scale W states, which
   effectively improve the success rate of generating target W state. The
   ability to generate two target W states makes our scheme have a distinct
   advantage in preparing W states with larger particle numbers. This
   preparation mechanism also can be generalized to the case of fusing more
   different or same particles W states.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Intrapartum fever occurs frequently during labor. The
   purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of epidural
   dexmedetomidine on maternal temperature, pain score and adverse effects
   during labor analgesia. Methods A total of 600 full-term primiparous
   parturients were randomly divided into two groups. The dexmedetomidine
   group (Group Dex, n = 300) received 0.1\% ropivacaine with 0.5 mu g/mL
   dexmedetomidine for epidural analgesia during labor, while the control
   group (Group C, n = 300) received 0.1\% ropivacaine alone. The maternal
   temperature, visual analogue scale (VAS) and Ramsay sedation score (RSS)
   were recorded, and the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood
   pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored. Side effects, if any,
   were also recorded. Results The incidence of intrapartum fever was lower
   in Group Dex than in Group C (4.1\% vs. 8.7\%, chi(2) = 5.07, P =
   0.024). VAS values from the time of 3 cm cervical dilatation to 10 cm
   cervical dilatation were also lower in Group Dex than in Group C (1.0
   +/- 0.9 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.7, t = 3.62, P < 0.001; 2.8 +/- 0.8 vs. 3.3 +/-
   0.8, t = 8.09, P < 0.001; 3.1 +/- 0.9 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.8, t = 3.88, P <
   0.001; 3.6 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.1 +/- 1.0, t = 5.86, P < 0.001, respectively).
   HR from the time of 3 cm cervical dilatation to 10 cm cervical
   dilatation was lower during labor in Group Dex than in Group C (80.0 +/-
   4.3 vs. 83.1 +/- 5.4 beats/min, t = 7.58, P < 0.001; 81.1 +/- 4.0 vs.
   83.7 +/- 5.5 beats/min, t = 6.48, P < 0.001; 78.9 +/- 5.4 vs. 81.5 +/-
   6.3 beats/min, t = 5.41, P < 0.001; 83.1 +/- 5.3 vs. 84.8 +/- 5.6
   beats/min, t = 3.75, P < 0.001, respectively), while SBP and DBP were
   similar between the two groups. The incidence of adverse events during
   labor was also similar between the two groups. Conclusion The present
   study showed that dexmedetomidine could reduce the incidence of
   intrapartum fever and relieve pain during labor without increasing
   adverse events.}},

Abstract = {{A receptor-mediated, active-targeting and glutathione (GSH) turn-on
   charge-reversal core/shell nanocomplex HA-MEA-s-s-TGA/PAMAM@DOX was
   constructed to achieve increased stability, improved cellular uptake,
   facilitated endo-lysosomal escape and enhanced antitumor efficacy. This
   nanocomplex was composed of anionic hyaluronic acid (HA)-graft
   GSH-sensitive HA-MEA-s-s-TGA as the outer shell and the cationic
   PAMAM@DOX core with encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX) into the hydrophobic
   cavities of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers. We hypothesized that the
   anionic outer layer could promote cellular uptake of
   HA-MEA-s-s-TGA/PAMAM@DOX by HA receptor-mediated endocytosis. After
   internalization into tumor cells, the outer shell of the internalized
   nanocomplex was disassembled in endo-lysosomes via the destruction of
   disulfide linkages to re-expose PAMAM drug core. This action induced
   release of the encapsulated DOX and facilitated endo-lysosomal escape
   through the synergistic action of the proton sponge effect and
   cationic-anionic interaction between protonated PAMAM and endo-lysosome
   membranes. In vitro release profiles demonstrated the intracellular
   environment-responsive release behavior of DOX from this nanocomplex,
   with a cumulative release of 80\% within 4 days in a simulated tumor
   intracellular microenvironment, whereas the surface charge changed from
   - 18.82 mV to + 10.95 mV. The MTT assay revealed the good
   biocompatibility of the negatively charged nanocomplex and efficient
   toxicity against HeLa cells. The designed pH/GSH dual-responsive
   nanocomplex could be an efficacious and safe delivery platform for
   cancer therapy.}},

   Autophagy Pathways}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Advanced breast cancer holds a poor prognosis for chemotherapy and
   endocrine therapy resistance. Autophagy is one of the main causes of
   tumor drug-therapy failure, and increasing evidence shows that EMT also
   is responsible for that. Metastasis-associated protein1 (MTA1) is up
   regulated in lots of tumors, which leads to tumor progression and drug
   resistance. However, the role of MTA1 in chemotherapeutic resistance in
   luminal-b breast cancer is still unclear. In this paper, our research
   shows that higher expression of MTA1 accompanies with worse prognosis in
   luminal-b breast cancer. Knockdown of MTA1 enhances the sensitivity of
   MCF-7 to gemcitabine and weakens the metastasis ability of MCF-7 in
   vitro and in vivo. Further, we find that knockdown of MTA1 strengthens
   the gemcitabine-mediated tumor growth inhibition effect in vivo, through
   reversion of the EMT process and inhibition of the autophagy process.
   Furthermore, our research builds the siMTA1-loaded exosomes, which
   increases the gemcitabine-mediated tumor growth inhibition effect in
   vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Alternative measures to deal with supply disruptions exist. We consider
   a make-to-order (MTO) supply chain with one manufacturer who sources
   from a single supplier. When a supply disruption occurs, the
   manufacturer can choose to satisfy some demand by either maintaining
   production through safety stocks or through a secondary contingent
   source, and turn some unmet demand into backorders on the basis of
   compensation. An optimal control model under consideration of the
   customers' dynamic reactions to the joint implementation of these
   strategies is formulated with the objective of minimising the cost of
   disruption. Through the application of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle,
   optimal mitigation strategies are established in closed form. They
   provide analytical guidance on how to dynamically and jointly adapt the
   quantity of contingent sourcing, the price of compensation, and the
   speed of safety inventory consumption. The results indicate how cost and
   time-related factors impact these strategies. We also demonstrate that
   pure strategies are only effective in tackling short supply shortages.
   For long disruptions, it is superior to adopt combined strategies that
   simultaneously incorporate two countermeasures in certain periods.}},

   infant with dyspnea caused by a mass in the uvula. Diagnosis: The
   patient was diagnosed with a uvular epidermoid cyst via neck soft tissue
   X-ray and flexible laryngoscopy. Interventions: Emergency surgery was
   performed. Outcomes: The patient recovered immediately after the
   operation and was discharged 1 day later. Lessons: In an infant with a
   uvula cyst, early surgical treatment may be needed to prevent symptoms,
   such as dyspnea, requiring emergency treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Antibiotics are widely used to treat various inflammatory bowel diseases
   caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). However, continuous
   use of antibiotics may lead to drug resistance. In this study, we
   investigated the role of human beta-defensin 118 (DEFB118) in regulating
   the ETEC-induced inflammation and intestinal injury. ETEC-challenged or
   non-challenged mice were treated by different concentrations of DEFB118.
   We show that ETEC infection significantly increased fecal score (P <
   0.05) and serum concentrations of interlukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Moreover, the concentrations of D-lactic acid,
   C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine (CREA), and urea (P < 0.05) were
   both increased in the ETEC-challenged mice. However, DEFB118
   significantly decreased their concentrations in the serum (P < 0.05).
   DEFB118 not only alleviated tissue damage in spleen upon ETEC challenge,
   but also increased the villus height in duodenum and ileum (P < 0.05).
   Moreover, DEFB118 improved the localization and abundance of tight
   junction protein ZO-1 in jejunal epithelium. Interestingly, DEFB118
   decreased the expression levels of critical genes involving in mucosal
   inflammatory responses (NF-kappa B, TLR4, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha) and
   the apoptosis (caspase3) upon ETEC challenge (P < 0.05), whereas DEFB118
   significantly upregulated the expression of mucosa functional genes such

Abstract = {{Hexagonal molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) as an effective non-noble cocatalyst
   is intensively researched in the photocatalytic H-2-evolution field
   owing to its Pt-like H+-adsorption ability and good conductivity.
   However, hexagonal Mo2C-modified photocatalysts possess a limited
   H-2-evolution rate because of the weak H-desorption ability. To further
   improve the activity, cubic MoC was introduced into Mo2C to form the
   carbon-modified MoC-Mo2C nanoparticles (MoC-Mo2C@C) by a calcination
   method. The resultant MoC-Mo2C@C (ca. 5 nm) was eventually coupled with
   TiO2 to acquire high-efficiency TiO2/MoC-Mo2C@C by electrostatic
   self-assembly. The highest H2-generation rate of TiO2/MoC-Mo2C@C reached
   of 918 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1), which was 91.8, 2.7, and 1.5 times than that
   of the TiO2, TiO2/MoC@C, and TiO2/Mo2C@C, respectively. The enhanced
   rate of TiO2 attributes to the carbon layer as cocatalyst to transmit
   electrons and the hetero-phase MoC-Mo2C as H-2-generation active sites
   to boost H-2-evolution reaction. This research offers a novel insight to
   design photocatalytic materials for energy applications.}},

Abstract = {{A workable approach named xTB-sTDDFT was selected to investigate the
   excited-state spectra of oxytocin (135 atoms), GHRP-6 (120 atoms) and
   insulin (793 atoms). Three different Hartree-Fock components functionals
   (wB97XD3: 51\%, LC-BLYP: 53\%, wB97X: 57\%) were used to calculate the
   excitation spectra, and the results calculated by wB97XD3 functional
   well agree with the experiments. It's a deep impression that computed
   time cost reduced by more than 80\%. For polypeptide (oxytocin and
   GHRP-6), both UV and fluorescence spectra were obtained, and the errors
   between the calculated and experimental values approximately were 20 nm.
   For Insulin, the errors are within 15 nm. UV spectrum peak is
   lambda(cal) = 262 nm (lambda(exp) = 277 nm, Delta lambda = 15 nm), and
   fluorescence spectrum peak is lambda(cal) = 294 nm (lambda(exp) = 304
   nm, Delta lambda = 10 nm). In summary, a suitable theoretical model is
   established to ultra-fast calculate the electronic excitation spectra of
   large systems, such as proteins and biomacromolecules, with good
   calculation accuracy, fast calculation speed and low cost.}},

Abstract = {{Key message Exogenous MJ does not alter the resin duct structure of
   pines in the cortex, but increases the number, density and mean size of
   resin ducts in the secondary xylem, particularly in Pinus sylvestris and
   P. radiata. Methyl jasmonate (MJ) is an organic compound capable of
   modulating defence responses in plants. Exogenous application of MJ has
   been shown to modify the structure of the resin canal system in conifers
   by inducing the formation of dense concentric bands of traumatic resin
   ducts in the xylem. Because inducibility of resin ducts has been little
   explored across pine species, 3-year-old Pinus pinaster, P. pinea, P.
   sylvestris and P. radiata trees were sprayed with 0, 25 and 50 mM
   solutions of MJ, and plant growth, external symptoms and histology were
   assessed 60 days after treatment. Exogenous application of MJ diminished
   primary or secondary growth in all species (61 and 25\%, respectively)
   and caused needle damage in P. sylvestris. Exogenous MJ did not alter
   the resin duct structure of Pinus spp. in the cortex. In the secondary
   xylem, however, the effect of MJ differed considerably between species:
   ducts, duct density and area covered by ducts increased in P. sylvestris
   and P. radiata, but not in P. pinaster and P. pinea. In MJ 50 mM-treated
   trees, resin duct abundance peaked at the first half of the ring in P.
   sylvestris and at one-third distance from the previous ring in P.
   radiata. In MJ treated P. radiata trees, large traumatic axial resin
   ducts, 120-160 mu m in diameter, were aligned in the secondary xylem.
   The study helps to elucidate macroevolutionary aspects of inducibility
   of resin-based defences in the genus Pinus, where varying responses to
   MJ could reveal different defence strategies among species.}},

Abstract = {{Coating of flexible substrates is crucial to prepare versatile,
   multifunctional materials. However, exploration of effective fabrication
   approaches is still a challenging issue, because the pathways generally
   proposed require time-consuming, multistep protocols. Here, we developed
   a one-pot process for decorating either pearl necklace-like or fibrous
   fluffy-like structures of polycaprolactone (PCL) with graphene oxide
   (GO) skin. PCL solutions were dry jet-wet electrosprayed or electrospun
   into a stirred liquid collector constituted by ethanol-containing GO
   nanoparticles. The stirred liquid collector enables the formation of
   3D-structures, whose microarchitecture can be designed by controlling
   the rheological behavior of PCL solutions. Two molecular weights of PCL
   were used (45 or 80 kDa) with ensuing different viscosity, which
   determines the prevalent formation of beads or fibers. The presence of
   GO in the coagulation bath allows the polymeric structures to be rapidly
   wrapped by those nanoparticles. Graphenic coating endows these materials
   with the intriguing peculiarities of GO: PCL/GO nanocomposites displayed
   increments of elastic modulus ranging from 1250\% (beads) to 3300\%
   (fibers) with respect to the neat matrices and a change from hydrophobic
   to amphiphilic character. A potential application of such devices in
   water treatment was assessed in phenol removal. The results pointed out
   that PCL/GO scaffolds retain the same sorption capacity of GO
   nanoparticles, while bringing several advantages in terms of handling,
   robustness, and recyclability. The ease of control of the process, as
   well as its fastness and cost-effectiveness could open a wide range of
   scenarios, including sensors, energy, catalysis, biomedicine.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Excess body fatness and physical activity independently
   influence the risk of several types of cancer. However, few studies have
   examined whether physical activity mitigates the excess risk associated
   with higher body mass index (BMI). Methods We examined the individual
   and joint associations between BMI (kg/m(2)) and leisure-time
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA, MET-hours/week) with the
   risk of three established excess body fatness-related cancers (breast,
   colon, and endometrial) among 43,795 postmenopausal women in the Cancer
   Prevention Study II (CPS-II) Nutrition Cohort (1992/1993-2015). Further
   exclusions for women without an intact uterus resulted in 31,805 women
   for endometrial cancer analyses. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards
   regression was used to calculate hazard ratio (HR) and 95\% confidence
   intervals (CIs) with interaction terms to assess multiplicative
   interaction. The relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) was
   calculated to assess additive interaction. Results BMI and MVPA were
   individually associated with breast and endometrial cancer risk, but
   only BMI was associated with colon cancer risk. In joint analyses,
   increasing levels of MVPA did not lower the risk of these cancers among
   obese women. For example, compared to the common referent (BMI 18.5- <
   25 kg/m(2), MVPA > 0- < 7.5 MET-hours/week), BMI >= 30 kg/m(2) was
   associated with a higher risk of breast cancer among women with low MVPA
   (> 0-< 7.5 MET-hours/week: HR = 1.42, 95\% CI: 1.22 - 1.67) and high
   MVPA (>= 15 MET-hours/week: HR = 1.53, 95\% CI: 1.25 - 1.87; RERI =
   0.20, 95\% CI: -0.14, 0.54, multiplicative P-interaction = 0.64).
   Conclusion Our results do not support the hypothesis that leisure-time
   physical activity mitigates the excess risk associated with higher BMI
   for risk of breast, endometrial, or colon cancer among postmenopausal
   women.}},

   Depressive and Anxious Symptomatology During the Coronavirus Pandemic
   (COVID-19) Lockdown}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{The coronavirus pandemic represents a severe global crisis, affecting
   physical, and psychological health. Lockdown rules imposed to counteract
   the rapid growth of COVID-19, mainly social restrictions, have
   represented a risk factor for developing depressive and anxious
   symptoms. The research aims are to explore the effect of coping
   strategies and perceived social support on depressive and anxious
   symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ninety-six healthy people
   (46 males, mean age = 39.3; SD = 16.6) completed through on-line
   platform: Socio-demographic questionnaire, Coping Inventory for
   Stressful Situations (CISS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social
   Support (MSPSS) and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), 3 weeks
   after the imposition of lockdown restrictions. SCL-90-R Depression
   scores showed significant positive correlation with CISS Emotion (r =
   0.85; p = 0.001) and Avoidant (r = 0.34; p = 0.018), a significant
   negative correlation with MSPSS Family support (r = -0.43; p = 0.003).
   SCL-90-R Anxiety scores showed a significant positive correlation with
   CISS Emotion (r = 0.72; p = 0.001) and Avoidant (r = 0.35; p = 0.016).
   No significant correlations between both CISS Emotion and Avoidant
   scales with social support emerged. Two Multiple Linear Regression
   analysis were performed using, respectively, SCL-90-R Depression and
   Anxiety scores as dependent variables, and the CISS and MSPSS scales,
   age, and gender as predictors. The first regression model (R-2 = 0.78;
   adjusted R-2 = 0.75) revealed CISS Emotion (beta = 0.83; p = 0.001) and
   MSPSS Family support (beta = -0.24; p = 0.004) had a predictive effect
   on SCL-90-R Depression scores. The second regression model (R-2 = 0.52;
   adjusted R-2 = 0.472) revealed that only CISS Emotion (beta = 0.71; p =
   0.001) predicted the SCL-90-R Anxiety scores. In conclusion, during the
   COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, coping focus on emotions seemed to increase
   anxious and depressive symptoms, probably due to the uncontrollable
   nature of the stressful event and the high emotional response. Family
   support which reduces the sense of loneliness had an exclusive role in
   mitigating depressive symptoms. These results highlight the importance
   of promoting psychological strategies to improve emotional regulation
   skills, reducing isolation from family, to prevent mood symptomatology
   in healthy citizens during large-scale health crises.}},

Abstract = {{The urgency of climate change means that low-carbon transitions are
   needed in large socio-technical systems such as energy and
   transportation. These transitions must be rapid, but also fair. An
   emerging body of evidence suggests that users have important roles in
   transitions, yet much previous research has examined user involvement
   while assuming it to be largely a positive force. This goes against a
   growing amount of evidence within sociotechnical studies that highlight
   the potentially obstructive or negative role that users may play in
   transitions and innovation. In this study, we pose a critical question:
   In what ways may users perpetuate injustices within a transition? To
   answer this question, we provide conceptual background on energy justice
   and user adoption of low-carbon energy and mobility technologies. We
   then analyse users and energy injustices in three low-carbon transitions
   - solar energy in Germany, electric vehicles in Norway, and smart meters
   in Great Britain - based on empirical data from interviews, focus
   groups, and internet forums. Our main contribution is to show how users
   in low-carbon transitions are not always positively engaged, or even
   neutral, but can introduce and contribute to inequality and exclusion.}},

Abstract = {{The effective Ce3+/Ce4+ redox and oxygen mobility of CeO2 induced by
   tunable nanostructure morphology has attracted a great interest in
   photocatalytic organic synthesis. Herein, we report on the
   microwave-assisted synthesis of CeO2 with nanoparticles (NPs), nanorods
   (NRs) and nanocubes (NCs) morphologies. The optical-electronic
   properties of the nanostructure CeO2 catalysts varied relatively with
   the respective morphologies. Ce-NPs catalyst showed a significant blue
   shift while a red shift was observed for Ce-NCs and a slight blue shift
   for Ce-NRs. The Ce-NRs and Ce-NPs showed high charge recombination
   suppression, which was due to the formation of surface defects
   associated with dislocations, steps and oxygen vacancies (V-o) as
   elucidated from the photolumiscence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   and electron paramagnetic resonance results. The surface oxygen defects
   populated with reactive superoxide oxygens of Ce-NRs and its high
   surface showed better photocatalytic activity for oxidation of
   alpha-pinene to pinene oxide, verbenol and verbenone as major products.
   A pinene conversion of 33.6 \% to pinene oxide with the selectivity of
   54.3 \% was achieved with Ce-NRs. The effective photocatalytic activity
   of the Ce-NRs was attributed to its enhanced efficient charge
   recombination suppression and oxygen vacancies. Ce-NRs catalyst was
   recyclable without any significant loss of its initial photoactivity.}},

   Maintain Perioperative Normothermia in Patients Undergoing Total Joint
   Arthroplasty}},
Journal = {{CUREUS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Forced-air warming is an established strategy for maintaining
   perioperative normothermia. However, this warming strategy can
   potentially contaminate the surgical field by circulating nonsterile
   air. This study aimed to determine whether changing practice away from
   this method resulted in non-inferior rates of perioperative hypothermia.
   Methods
   We performed a chart review of primary total hip and knee arthroplasty
   patients from 2014 to 2017, when the strategy of intraoperative
   forced-air warming (FAW) was changed to preoperative FAW along with
   intraoperative underbody conduction warming (CW) with an underbody
   warming mattress. Data included patient temperatures throughout all
   phases of care, blood loss and transfusion requirements, length of
   postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and hospital stays, and 30-day infection
   and mortality.
   Results
   A total of 769 charts were reviewed; 349 patients underwent surgery
   before the practice change and 420 after. Mean (SD; 95\% CI) body
   temperatures at the time of incision were lower for group 1 than for
   group 2 (34.55 vs 35.52 degrees C {[}0.97 degrees C; 95\% CI, 0.72-1.23
   degrees C]). The average nadir of intraoperative body temperature was
   lower for group 1 than for group 2 (difference of means, 0.44 degrees C;
   95\% CI, 0.18-0.71 degrees C). Group 2 had a higher percentage of
   patients who presented hypothermic (temperature <36.0 degrees C) on
   arrival in the PACU (12.9\% vs 7.7\%).
   Conclusion
   Preoperative convective warming combined with intraoperative underbody
   conductive warming maintains normothermia during primary total joint
   arthroplasty and is non-inferior to forced-air intraoperative warming
   alone.}},

Abstract = {{Dual delivery of bioactive molecules (drugs and growth factors) has been
   attempted to enhance multiple processes during tissue regeneration. For
   bone tissue engineering, many attempts have been made to enhance
   osteogenesis coupled angiogenesis, which plays a major role during the
   bone regeneration process. In this study, core-shell microgels were
   fabricated for controlled release of recombinant human bone
   morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP-2) and simvastatin from the core and
   shell, respectively. The microgels were formed with a discrete core and
   shell structure. The Fourier transform infrared analysis demonstrated
   the composition of microgel, whereas swelling behavior demonstrated its
   rapid swelling property. Thermal properties demonstrated the ionic
   gelation in microgels, which minimizes the thermal degradation of
   polymers. The degradation study demonstrates that the core-shell
   structure of microgels was intact until 49 days under physiological
   conditions. The release profile demonstrates the sequential and
   controlled release of rhBMP-2 from the core and simvastatin from the
   shell of the microgels, respectively. The bioactivity of rhBMP-2 and
   simvastatin released from microgels was preserved as indicated by the
   alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay. The cell proliferation of
   mouse preosteoblast (MC3T3-E1) cells and the live-dead staining assay
   demonstrated cytocompatibility of the microgels. Scanning electron
   microscopy images demonstrate that the microgels support adhesion of
   cells on the surface and promote extracellular matrix (ECM) production.
   The osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells demonstrated the
   synergistic effect of drugs and growth factors up to 21 days. The
   controlled and sustained release of simvastatin and rhBMP-2 induced
   higher mRNA and protein expressions of RUNX2, osteocalcin, and VEGF. The
   overall results demonstrate the effect of controlled release of rhBMP-2
   and simvastatin from core-shell microgels to promote osteogenesis and
   angiogenesis.}},

Title = {{Chloroplast-based DNA barcode analysis indicates high discriminatory

Abstract = {{The study was conducted to evaluate the discriminatory potential of
   selected chloroplast-based DNA barcode regions for identifying and
   resolving phylogeny of the Indian bamboos. Among 11 chloroplast markers
   screened, only four, namely matK, rbcL, psbK-I and rps16-trnQ showed
   successful amplification in 88 genotypes of 30 Indian bamboo taxa under
   Bambuseae and Arundinarieae tribes. A total of 244 sequences were
   generated for the four chloroplast regions. Tree-based analysis
   demonstrated that none of the tested regions successfully discriminated
   the taxa under Bambuseae tribe. Importantly, our highly concerned
   Himalayan temperate bamboo species under Arundinarieae tribe, were
   successfully discriminated by matK locus with high bootstrap support
   (>60\%). Sequence comparisons revealed that the discriminatory power
   demonstrated by matK region actually lies in the few unique fixed
   nucleotides (UFNs) despite the overall DNA polymorphism. Although,
   rps16-trnQ region was found to be the most polymorphic and revealed high
   genetic divergence among different taxonomic levels, it could not
   successfully discriminated the taxa with strong statistical support. In
   a taxonomically difficult plant group like bamboos, whose genome is
   relatively more complex and has a slow rate of molecular evolution, it
   is difficult to get a universal marker. Further, highly variable barcode
   regions utilized in other species may not be informative, and thus, the
   development of DNA barcodes for different taxonomic levels, such as
   lineages or tribes could be a viable approach.}},

   improve the dispersion of graphene on the pore surface of a sponge. It
   was found that a graphene/sponge nanocomposite at 0.79 wt.\%
   demonstrated ideal electrical conductivity. The composite materials have
   high strain sensitivity, stable fatigue performance for 20 000 cycles,
   short response time of 0.401 s and fast response to temperature and
   pressure. In addition, the composites are effective in monitoring
   materials deformation and acoustic attenuation with a maximum absorption
   rate 67.78\% and it can be used as electrodes for a supercapacitor with
   capacitance of 18.1 F g(-1).Moreover, no expensive materials or complex

Abstract = {{This study assessed the feasibility of struvite formation as a
   sustainable alternative for increasing the availability of phosphorus by
   applying a coated fertilizer. Diammonium phosphate fertilizer granules
   were coated with sepiolite-chitosan nanocomposites (SCF) to increase the
   use efficiency of phosphate fertilizer. The phosphorus uses efficiency
   of SCFs was studied under greenhouse conditions using Zea mays (maize)
   as the test plant and an efficiency improvement were observed. The
   phosphorus uptake as the result of available phosphorus increased, when
   fertilizing with the coated phosphate fertilizers. Suspensions of
   different-coated fertilizer treatments were prepared in 3 pH levels
   (6,7,8) and the chemical speciation was assessed by Visual MINTEQ 3.1.
   Precipitation and dissolution reactions were considered as the struvite
   formation mechanism. Also, the formation of struvite in a calcareous
   soil was evaluated in three incubation periods by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) technique. The XRD patterns showed the peaks of struvite, while
   the peak of sepiolite decreased gradually with increasing incubation
   time that could be explained by the transformation of this mineral to
   amorphous fibrous silica. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses also
   showed diffusion of phosphorus into the coating region, probably forming
   metastable magnesium phosphate that can facilitate the movement of P
   aside from the fertilizer granule toward the soil matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) is characterized by visual dysfunction
   after indirect or direct injury to the optic nerve following blunt head
   trauma. TON is associated with increased oxidative stress and
   inflammation resulting in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death. Remote
   ischemic post-conditioning (RIC) has been shown to enhance endogenous
   protective mechanisms in diverse disease models including stroke,
   vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), retinal injury and optic nerve
   injury. However, the protective mechanisms underlying the improvement of
   retinal function and RGC survival after RIC treatment remain unclear.
   Here, we hypothesized that RIC therapy may be protective following TON
   by preventing RGC death, oxidative insult and inflammation in the mouse
   retina. To carry out the study, mice were divided in three different
   groups (Control, TON and TON + RIC). We harvested retinal tissue 5 days
   after TON induction for western blotting and histochemical analysis. We
   observed increased TON-induced retinal cell death compared with controls
   by cleaved caspase-3 immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the TON cohort
   demonstrated increased TUNEL positive cells which were significantly
   attenuated by RIC. Immunofluorescence data showed that oxidative stress
   markers dihydroethidium (DHE), NOX-2 and nitrotyrosine expression were
   elevated in the TON group relative to controls and RIC therapy
   significantly reduced the expression level of these markers. Next, we
   found that the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha was increased and
   anti-inflammatory IL-10 was decreased in plasma of TON animals, and RIC
   therapy reversed this expression level. Interestingly, western blotting
   of retinal tissue showed that RGC marker Brn3a and tight junction
   proteins (ZO-1 and Occludin), and AMPK alpha 1 expression were
   downregulated in the TON group compared to controls. However, RIC
   significantly increased the expression levels of these proteins.
   Together these data suggest that RIC therapy activates endogenous
   protective mechanisms which may attenuate TON-induced oxidative stress
   and inflammation, and improves BRB integrity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the evolution of the pore size distribution of a
   fresh unconsolidated geopolymer paste between one day and a week, using
   thermoporometry. This was made possible by following a careful protocol
   for sample preparation and for analysis by differential scanning
   calorimetry. In contrast with nitrogen gas adsorption, this method
   quantifies directly the amount of water in pores. It also does not
   require heat and vacuum drying, thus maintaining the fragile pore
   structure of the unconsolidated paste. Moreover, it was found that, in a
   typical metakaolin-based sodium geopolymer with a 10 to 20 hours
   workability period, the porosity gradually refines during the first week
   while the mesoporous volume is cut in half. This is probably due to the
   fact that the geopolymer network was still actively condensing from the
   activation solution. Part of the pore water never froze and, from mass
   balance, this residual water was attributed to the water bound in the
   hydration shell of the sodium counter ions. Only a minor occurrence of
   covalently bound protons as silanol groups was observed. The results
   presented here usefully complement data obtained by conventional
   techniques at later ages on consolidated geopolymers. It supports the
   growing body of literature on the structural evolution of geopolymers

Abstract = {{Trust is considered to be a crucial element of social cohesion. At the
   same time, as research has shown, education can be understood as an
   important precondition of trust. Furthermore, contextual conditions are
   important for the development of trust. In spite of this, the role of
   trust in the multi-level education system has been scarcely
   investigated. This paper introduces a comprehensive model of trust in
   the education system, based on a systematic literature review of 183
   recent peer-reviewed articles following a thematic and interpretive
   review approach. The suggested model consists of four interconnected
   elements (generalised trust, educational governance, educational
   settings, educational attainment). By introducing a comprehensive model
   of trust in multi-level education systems the paper aims at opening up
   perspectives for future theoretically driven, interdisciplinary
   comparative research that may shed further light on the role of trust in
   education systems. The paper proceeds as follows. First, trust is
   discussed as a complex subject in research, policy and practice in
   multi-level education systems, and key research questions are derived
   from this. Second, the methodology of the systematic literature review
   is explained. Third, results from the literature review are presented,
   focusing on three domains of trust and their interrelations. Fourth, the
   comprehensive model of trust in multi-level education systems is
   introduced. The fifth section discusses the findings and explores how
   future research could advance a comprehensive understanding of trust in
   education.}},

   product. In this study, meiotic segregant Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y7,
   which exhibits the NewFlo type flocculation desirable for brewing, was
   isolated from the top-fermenting yeast S. cerevisiae Y6. Next-generation
   sequencing showed that the Y7 genome contained two predicted genes
   (homologs of FLO5 and Lg-FLO1) that might be involved in NewFlo-type
   flocculation. Two transformants were constructed by inserting a drug
   resistance gene (kanMX6) into the respective genes. Flocculation was
   maintained when kanMX6 was inserted into the FLO5 homolog, but
   significantly reduced in the transformant when kanMX6 was inserted into
   one of the Lg-FLO1 loci. These results suggested that the Lg-FLO1
   homolog is involved in the NewFlo-type flocculation of the
   top-fermenting yeast S. cerevisiae Y7. The bottom-fermenting S.
   pastorianus yeast strains commonly used in brewing are widely believed
   to derive from a natural hybrid of S. eubayanus and S. cerevisiae (i.e.,
   a top-fermenting parent strain). Based on our results, it is speculated
   that the flocculation type and Lg-FLO1 gene of bottom-fermenting yeast
   are derived from top-fermenting yeast. These findings are expected to
   contribute to cross breeding work in the brewing industry and to the
   control of flocculation of top-fermenting yeast.}},

Abstract = {{In tiered instructional systems (Response to Intervention
   {[}RTI]/Multitier System of Supports {[}MTSS]) that rely on ongoing
   assessment of students at risk of experiencing academic difficulties,
   the ability to make informed decisions using student data is critical
   for student learning. Prior research has demonstrated that, on average,
   teachers have difficulty analyzing and interpreting student
   progress-monitoring (PM) data presented graphically (i.e., graph
   literacy). This study examines the impact that teacher training,
   experience, and confidence have on teacher graph literacy, using
   structural equation modeling. Data were gathered from a nationally
   representative sample of 309 teachers and included latent variables
   related to their experience (e.g., years teaching, years working with
   RTI), training (e.g., hours of data-based decision-making {[}DBDM]
   professional development), and confidence (e.g., confidence in
   interpreting data, confidence in determining student response) as well
   as data-based decision-making skills on a graph literacy assessment.
   Findings indicate that latent experience and confidence factors
   predicted graph literacy but training did not. Furthermore, training
   increased teacher confidence but experience did not. Finally, confidence
   did not mediate the effect of experience or training on graph literacy.}},

Abstract = {{The term `information' is used extensively in biology, cognitive science
   and the philosophy of consciousness in relation to the concepts of
   `meaning' and `causation'. While `information' is a term that serves a
   useful purpose in specific disciplines, there is much to the concept
   that is problematic. Part 1 is a critique of the stance that information
   is an independently existing entity. On this view, and in biological
   contexts, systems transmit, acquire, assimilate, decode and manipulate
   it, and in so doing, generate meaning. I provide a detailed proposal in
   Part 2 that supports the claim that it is the dynamic form of a system
   that qualifies the informational nature of meaningful interactive
   engagement, that is, that information is dependent on dynamic form
   rather than that it exists independently. In Part 3, I reflect on the
   importance of the distinction between the independent and dependent
   stances by looking specifically at the implications for how we might
   better interpret causation and emergence.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Microbial electrosynthesis exploits the catalytic activity of
   microorganisms to utilize a cathode as an electron donor for reducing
   waste CO2 to valuable fuels and chemicals. Electromethanogenesis is the
   process of CO2 reduction to CH4 catalyzed by methanogens using the
   cathode directly as a source of electrons or indirectly via H-2.
   Understanding the effects of different set cathode potentials on the
   functional dynamics of electromethanogenic communities is crucial for
   the rational design of cathode materials. Replicate enriched
   electromethanogenic communities were subjected to different potentials
   (-1.0 V and-0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and the potential-induced changes were
   analyzed using a metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach. The most
   abundant and transcriptionally active organism on the biocathodes was a
   novel species of Methanobacterium sp. strain 34x. The cathode
   potential-induced changes limited electron donor availability and
   negatively affected the overall performance of the reactors in terms of
   CH4 production. Although high expression of key genes within the methane
   and carbon metabolism pathways was evident, there was no significant
   difference in transcriptional response to the different set potentials.
   The acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase (ACDS) complex were the most
   highly expressed genes, highlighting the significance of carbon
   assimilation under limited electron donor conditions and its link to the
   methanogenesis pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Background Contributing to the literature on reintegration and community
   supervision, we consider the mental health experiences of women parolees
   and the implications for case management.
   Aims We consider the different ways mental health considerations are
   responded to by parole officers and case management staff, identifying
   areas of tension (e.g., when psychological services are fused with
   supervision) but also areas of opportunity (e.g., when case management
   staff forge therapeutic relationships with parolees).
   Methods Using a grounded approach we explore women's parole experiences
   and case management practices through a qualitative analysis of parole
   and casework documents. Our iterative process of document analysis
   included content and thematic analysis.
   Results Mental health is responded to both as a therapeutic need and
   criminogenic risk. Therapeutic responses entail both formal and informal
   supportive interventions that often appear welcomed by and beneficial to
   parolees. Risk-based responses fuse mental health considerations into
   supervisory frameworks, evidenced by the prominence of mental
   health-related parole conditions and the role of psychologists as
   assessors of risk.
   Conclusions/Implications for Clinical Practice The tension between
   treatment and supervision can undermine conditions favourable to
   responsive case management and the working alliance.}},

Journal = {{NEW MEDIA \& SOCIETY}},
Abstract = {{Despite their ephemeral constantly changing nature, social media
   constitute an archive of public discourse. In this study, we examine
   when, how, and why journalists practice proactive ephemerality, deleting
   their tweets either manually or automatically to consider the viability
   of social media as a public record. Based on interviews conducted with
   journalists in New York City, we find many journalists delete their
   tweets, and that software-aided mass deletion is common, damaging
   Twitter's standing as an archive. Through deletion, journalists
   manipulate temporality, exposing the public to a brief tweeting window
   to reduce risks and regain control in a precarious labor market and a
   harassment-ridden public sphere in which employers leave them largely
   unprotected. When deleting tweets mechanically, journalists emulate
   platform logic by depending-as commercial platforms often do-on
   automatic procedures rather than on human expertise. This constitutes a
   surrender of the very qualities that make human judgment so valuable.}},

Abstract = {{One of the largest nationwide bursts of the first COVID-19 outbreak
   occurred in Spain, where infection expanded in densely populated areas
   through March 2020. We analyse the cumulative growth curves of reported
   cases and deaths in all Spain and two highly populated regions, Madrid
   and Catalonia, identifying changes and sudden shifts in their
   exponential growth rate through segmented Poisson regressions. We
   associate these breakpoints with a timeline of key events and
   containment measures, and data on policy stringency and citizen
   mobility. Results were largely consistent for infections and deaths in
   all territories, showing four major shifts involving 19-71\% reductions
   in growth rates originating from infections before 3 March and on 5-8,
   10-12 and 14-18 March, but no identifiable effect of the strengthened
   lockdown of 29-30 March. Changes in stringency and mobility were only
   associated to the latter two shifts, evidencing an early deceleration in
   COVID-19 spread associated to personal hygiene and social distancing
   recommendations, followed by a stronger decrease when lockdown was
   enforced, leading to the contention of the outbreak by mid-April. This
   highlights the importance of combining public health communication

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{We investigated how the shape of polymeric vesicles, made by the exact
   same material, impacts the replication activity and metabolic state of
   both cancer and non-cancer cell types. First, we isolated discrete
   geometrical structures (spheres and tubes) from a heterogeneous sample
   using density-gradient centrifugation. Then, we characterized the
   cellular internalization and the kinetics of uptake of both types of
   polymersomes in different cell types (either cancer or non-cancer
   cells). We also investigated the cellular metabolic response as a
   function of the shape of the structures internalized and discovered that
   tubular vesicles induce a significant decrease in the replication
   activity of cancer cells compared to spherical vesicles. We related this
   effect to the significant up-regulation of the tumor suppressor genes
   p21 and p53 with a concomitant activation of caspase 3/7. Finally, we
   demonstrated that combining the intrinsic shape-dependent effects of
   tubes with the delivery of doxorubicin significantly increases the
   cytotoxicity of the system. Our results illustrate how the geometrical
   conformation of nanoparticles could impact cell behavior and how this
   could be tuned to create novel drug delivery systems tailored to
   specific biomedical application.}},

Abstract = {{More than 13\% of parents identify as being alienated by at least one of
   their children. Parental alienation often occurs after divorce when one
   parent (un)intentionally persuades his or her children to distance
   themselves from or reject the other parent. This study, couched in
   relational dialectics theory, explores the meaning of parenting from the
   perspective of 40 alienated parents. This analysis yielded two competing
   discourses: the culturally dominant discourse of parental norms (DPN)
   and the culturally marginalized discourse of parental victimization
   (DPV). Throughout the narrative interviews, the DPV resisted the DPN in
   four ways (diachronic separation, entertaining, countering, and
   negating). This study's findings provide insights into the perspective
   of the alienated parents, advance what we know about family distancing,
   and provide practical implications.}},

Pages = {{85-94}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Teacher noticing has been widely understood as a kind of seeing or way
   of making sense of classroom events and instructional details. Such
   notions of teacher noticing often construe noticing as a disembodied,
   purely mental form of seeing and position the teacher as separated or
   separable from the observing environment. They rely on intuitive models
   that adopt the usual divide between mind, body, and matter, and that
   fuel the dualism between the individual and the environment. In this
   paper, I attempt to work towards a more comprehensive model of teacher
   noticing that instead proposes an entanglement of the
   cultural-historical, embodied-ecological, and social-material. Teacher
   noticing, in such a proposal, includes culturally and historically
   constituted forms of framing classroom events, embodied ways of
   accessing and exploring the classroom world, and active shaping and
   interaction with the classroom setting's social and material structure.}},

Title = {{Cognitive training for robotic surgery: a chance to optimize surgical

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SURGERY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{761-767}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The rapid rise of robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) has necessitated an
   efficient and standardized training curriculum. Cognitive training (CT)
   can significantly improve skills, such as attention, working memory and
   problem solving, and can enhance surgical capacity and support RAS
   training. This pilot study was carried out between 02/2019 and 04/2019.
   The participants included 33 student volunteers, randomized into 3
   groups: group 1 received training using the da Vinci training simulator,
   group 2 received computer-based cognitive training, and group 3 was the
   control group without training. Before (T1) and after-training (T2),
   performance was measured. Additionally, expert ratings and
   self-evaluations were collected. Subjective evaluations of performance
   were supplemented by evaluations based on three scales from the revised
   NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R). In total, 25 probands remained
   with complete data for further analyses: n = 8 (group 1), n = 7 (group
   2) and n = 10 (group 3). There were no significant differences in T1 and
   T2 among all three groups. The average training gain of group 1 and 2
   was 15.87\% and 24.6\%, respectively, (a restricting condition is the
   loss of the last training session in group 2). Analyses of
   semi-structured psychological interviews (SPIs) revealed no significant
   differences for T1, but in T2, significance occurred at
   `self-reflection' for group 2 (F(2.22) = 8.56; p < .005). The efficacy
   of CT in training highly complex and difficult procedures, such as RAS,
   is a proven and accepted fact. Further investigation involving higher
   numbers of training trials (while also being cost effective) should be
   performed.}},

Abstract = {{This research study evaluates various pre-treatments to improve sewage
   sludge solubilization prior to treatment by mesophilic anaerobic
   digestion. Microwave, thermal, and sonication pre-treatments were
   compared as these pre-treatments are the most commonly used for this
   purpose. The solubilization of sewage sludge was evaluated through the
   variation in soluble total organic carbon (sTOC, mg/L) and soluble total
   nitrogen (sTN, mg/L). Thermal and microwave pre-treatments increased
   sTOC/VS by 19.2\% and 83.4\% (VS, total volatile solids), respectively,
   after applying lower specific energy through (20 kJ/g TS, approximately)
   (TS, total solids) unlike the sonication pre-treatment, which required
   136 kJ/g TS. Although sTN content did not increase significantly with
   the pre-treatments with respect to sTOC, both showed proportional
   trends. Sonication pre-treatments allowed the highest increase in
   volatile fatty acids (VFA) with respect to the raw sewage sludge (15\%
   increment VFA/sTOC). Methane production with and without pre-treatment
   was also evaluated. Methane production increased by 95\% after applying
   sonication pre-treatment compared to the methane production of raw
   sewage sludge. Thermal and microwave pre-treatments entailed lower
   improvements (29\% and 20\%, respectively). Economically, thermal
   pre-treatments were the most viable alternative at real scale.}},

   between 1.77 to 5.39. Analysis of carbon subfractions reveals OC3 and
   EC1 as the dominant fraction suggesting fossil fuel combustion as
   dominant emission sources. The exposure risk estimated on the basis of
   inhalation dose was observed very high during the winter season which
   can adversely affect the health of people. This study also revealed that
   the emissions from the residential area are the key source of OC and EC,
   along with PM1.}},

Title = {{Web 2.0-enabled team relationships: an actor-network perspective}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WORK AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines how the deployment of Web 2.0 technologies,
   specifically digital platforms for internal communication within
   organizations, influences the nature of the team relationship. Previous
   research on the impact of these technologies in teams call for new
   approaches and conceptualizations of leadership. However, there is no
   consensus in the literature to help us understand the nature of team
   relationships that are sustained by these technological intermediations.
   To address this gap, we theoretically explore how the intermediation of
   Web 2.0 technology within teams generates what we propose as the
   technologized team relationship, in which the technology is as much a
   part of the relationship as the humans involved. In doing so, we also
   highlight potential unintended consequences for individuals in this
   technologized team relationship. We underpin our analyses with Latourian
   actor-network theory, which recognizes the agency of objects such as
   digital technologies in social relationships with humans. We then
   propose a theoretical framework for understanding and researching the
   nature of this technologized team relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Mars has lost most of its once-abundant water to space, leaving the
   planet cold and dry. In standard models, molecular hydrogen produced
   from water in the lower atmosphere diffuses into the upper atmosphere
   where it is dissociated, producing atomic hydrogen, which is lost. Using
   observations from the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer on the Mars
   Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution spacecraft, we demonstrate that water
   is instead transported directly to the upper atmosphere, then
   dissociated by ions to produce atomic hydrogen. The water abundance in
   the upper atmosphere varied seasonally, peaking in southern summer, and
   surged during dust storms, including the 2018 global dust storm. We
   calculate that this transport of water dominates the present-day loss of
   atomic hydrogen to space and influenced the evolution of Mars' climate.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Glioma is a common primary brain malignancy with a poor prognosis.
   Chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for brain tumors but low
   efficiency of drugs in crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and drug
   resistance related to tumor hypoxia thwart its efficacy. Herein, a
   theranostic nanodrug (iRPPA@TMZ/MnO) is developed by incorporating oleic
   acid-modified manganese oxide (MnO) and temozolomide (TMZ) into a
   polyethylene glycol-poly(2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate-based
   polymeric micelle containing internalizing arginine-glycine-aspartic
   acid (iRGD). The presence of iRGD provides the nanodrug with a high
   capacity of crossing the BBB and penetrating the tumor tissue. After
   accumulation in glioma, the nanodrug responds to the tumor
   microenvironment to simultaneously release TMZ, Mn2+, and O-2. The
   released TMZ induces tumor cell apoptosis and the released Mn2+ causes
   intracellular oxidative stress that kill tumor cells via a Fenton-like
   reaction. The O-2 produced in situ alleviates tumor hypoxia and enhances
   the chemotherapy/chemodynamic therapeutic effects against glioma. The
   Mn2+ can also serve as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent
   for tumor imaging during therapy. The study demonstrates the great
   potential of this multifunctional nanodrug for MRI-visible therapy of
   brain glioma.}},

Abstract = {{The dilatancy and non-coaxiality of sand are investigated under
   generalised loading including rotation of the stress principal axes
   (PA), in drained and undrained conditions. Weak non-coaxiality is
   exhibited under radial loading being dependent on the stress direction
   relative to the deposition direction, as well as on state, and gradually
   diminishing beyond peak failure. On the contrary, non-coaxiality is
   stronger and persists in the post-peak regime when sand is subjected to
   rotation of the stress PA. In conditions involving undrained rotation of
   the stress PA at constant total stress principal values (PV), distinct
   non-coaxiality patterns and elastic-plastic coupling are observed under
   increasing stress ratio, while a steady state is ultimately attained.
   This study shows that sand exhibits strong non-coaxiality and contracts
   immediately upon initiating the rotation of the stress PA at constant
   effective stress PV very close to critical state (CS), while it was
   previously dilating on the failure surface in a coaxial deformation
   mode, under radial loading; the phenomenon becomes increasingly intense
   as CS is approached. The degree of non-coaxiality and associated
   contractancy becomes higher when the previous shearing becomes more
   persistent, in terms of shear strain accumulation, while the influence
   of pre-shearing is stronger than that of the degree of stress rotation
   and the level of eta = q/p `, p `, e, and b = (sigma `(2) - sigma
   `(3))/(sigma `(1) - sigma `(3)), but diminishes gradually during stress
   rotation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to eliminate Part defects and enrich
   additive manufacturing of ceramics. Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF)
   experiments were carried to investigate the effects of laser parameters
   and selective oxidation of Titanium (mixed with TiO2) on the
   microstructure, surface quality and melting state of Titania. The causes
   of several L-PBF parts defects were thoroughly analyzed.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Laser power and scanning speed were varied within a specific range
   (50-125 W and 170-200 mm/s, respectively). Furthermore, varying loads of
   Ti (1\%, 3\%, 5\% and 15\%) were mixed with TiO2, which was selectively
   oxidized with laser beam in the presence of oxygen environment.
   Findings
   Part defects such as cracks, pores and uneven grains growth were widely
   reduced in TiO2 L-PBF specimens. Increasing the laser power and
   decreasing the scanning speed shown significant improvements in the
   surface morphology of TiO2 ceramics. The amount of Ti material was fully
   melted and simultaneously changed into TiO2 by the application of the
   laser beam. The selective oxidation of Ti material also improved the
   melting condition, microstructure and surface quality of the specimens.
   Originality/value
   TiO2 ceramic specimens were produced through L-PBF process. Increasing
   the laser power and decreasing the scanning speed is an effective way to
   sufficiently melt the powders and reduce parts defects. Selective
   oxidation of Ti by a high power laser beam approach was used to improve
   the manufacturability of TiO2 specimens.}},

Title = {{An extensive posterior circulation infarction secondary to primary
   hyperthyroidism accompanied with superior mesenteric artery syndrome A
   case report and description of patho-physiological association}},
Journal = {{MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{99}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Hyperthyroidism-related anterior circulation ischemic
   events have been well documented; however, posterior circulation
   infarction is rarely reported, not to mention with superior mesenteric
   artery syndrome (SMAS), which has never been reported concurrently. We
   describe, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of
   hyperthyroidism-related cerebellar infarction accompanied with SMAS.
   Patient concerns: A 22-year-old women presented with palpitation,
   postprandial vomiting, and acute body weight loss. Enlarged thyroid
   gland was discovered in physical examination and Graves disease was
   diagnosed by blood test; therefore, Propylthiouracil and beta-blocker
   were prescribed. Sudden onset conscious disturbance accompanied with
   apnea was noted during hospitalization.
   Diagnosis: Computed tomography (CT) revealed cerebellar infarction with
   severe cerebellar swelling and tonsil herniation; hence, emergent
   suboccipital craniotomy and bilateral tonsillectomy were performed.
   Interventions: Nevertheless, persisted poor passage of liquid diet
   during nasogastric tube feeding was noted after operation. CT of abdomen
   showed a sharp aorta-SMA angle (15 degrees) and a short distance between
   aorta and SMA (6 mm) indicating a diagnosis of SMAS.
   Outcomes: After parental nutrition supplement and progressive
   rehabilitation program, she recovered to a modified Rankin Scale of 3.
   Conclusion: Although rarely reported, hyperthyroidism-related
   sympathetic hyperstimulation, vasculopathy could result in potentially
   deadly posterior circulation infarction. Furthermore, SMAS should be
   considered in the cases of hyperthyroidism with prolonged
   gastrointestinal symptoms even after treatment and should be treated
   simultaneously, since SMAS exacerbates depletion of intravascular
   volume. Further study to clarify the relation between hyperthyroidism
   and posterior circulation hemodynamic status is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring hydrogen refueling stations (HRS) ensures the safety of their
   operations as well as meeting the required performance standard for
   refueling. Traditionally, table-based or dynamic control of fueling
   process methods were used to guide the fueling process. We propose to
   use machine learning methods to predict the main performance target of
   the fueling process; the state of charge (SOC). Based on initial
   operating conditions in start-up fueling time, least absolute shrinkage
   and selection operator (LASSO) is used to predict non-dispensing fueling
   events, normal, and undershot dispensing events. The computational
   experiments were conducted on three hydrogen refueling stations with up
   to two-years of operational data. The classification accuracy reached
   over 85\% on three stations. The SOC in future time steps were predicted
   using a multi-task regression model. The predicted future SOC within one
   minute is accurate on two data-rich stations. In both classification and
   regression tasks, the training models built on data-rich stations
   greatly improved the performance of a station with much less training
   data. These results show using machine learning methods on predicting
   the performance of fueling events is feasible and satisfactory on HRS.
   To optimize operation strategies, machine learning models can be
   integrated into the controller of HRS as an alternative way of
   controlling the fueling process. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by

Abstract = {{Mid-long term voltage stability refers to voltage stability concerning
   the dynamics of the slow dynamic elements and protection devices in
   power systems. To improve the mid-long term voltage stability, this
   paper proposes a scheme of model predictive control (MPC) based on
   Galerkin method. The basic principle of MPC is to solve the optimization
   problem regarding voltage stability control based on the prediction
   model periodically. By applying the optimal control scheme to power
   systems, the mid-long term voltage stability can be enhanced. The
   Galerkin method-based polynomial approximation approximates the
   relationship between mid-long term trajectories and control parameters
   by a polynomial function. The polynomial function acts as a prediction
   model to predict future system trajectories under different values of
   control parameters in MPC. The advantage of the proposed method is that
   its prediction accuracy is relatively high and thus the control
   efficiency of MPC is improved, as the polynomial function can embody the
   non-linear characteristics of the power system. In the case study, the
   3-machine 10-bus system and the New England 39-bus system are taken as
   examples to compare the MPC based on the proposed method and the
   trajectory sensitivity method in terms of prediction accuracy,
   computation time and control results.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - As an important platform for academic communication and
   knowledge acquisition, academic social network (ASN) has attracted
   worldwide researchers. The purpose of this paper is to examine and
   compare the differences of corporation researchers in ASN utilization
   from the two aspects of social performance and academic performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - Applying knowledge-based theory, this
   paper decoupled ASN into social network and academic network and
   measured utilization of users by social performance and academic
   performance. Hypotheses were proposed from the perspectives of research
   areas and corporate reputation. In the part of empirical research, the
   top 92 research corporations were selected as the sample, and relevant
   metric data from the member profile pages on ResearchGate was collected
   for comparing analysis to explore their utilization characteristics.
   Findings - The results show that users of different research
   corporations have certain favoritism in their utilization of ASNs.
   Science and technology-oriented corporations are better in comprehensive
   social performance and academic quality. Science-oriented corporations
   are better at utilizing the interactive functions. However, neither
   social utilization nor academic utilization, technology-oriented
   corporations perform well.
   Originality/value - This paper focuses on corporation researchers, who
   have started to embrace ASNs but whose behaviors were less studied. The
   research paradigm is an expansion and enrichment of the dual network
   decoupling theory in the field of ASN research. It also deepens the
   research on ASN utilization of corporation researchers and could give
   references for ASNs to improve service for corporation users in
   different research areas.

Abstract = {{Secretory phospholipase A2 group IB (sPLA2-IB) and M-type phospholipase
   A2 receptor (PLA2R) are closely associated with proteinuria in
   idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN). Podocytes constitute an
   important component of glomerular filtration, and high basal autophagy
   is indispensable for podocyte function. The current study aimed to
   analyze the relationship between sPLA2-IB and podocyte autophagy in IMN
   and determine whether sPLA2-IB mediates abnormal autophagy regulation in
   podocytes. The serum sPLA2-IB level and podocyte autophagy were
   detected, and clinical data were collected from IMN patients with
   different proteinuria levels. Then, the effects of sPLA2-IB on autophagy
   signaling pathways were evaluated in cultured human podocytes treated
   with sPLA2-IB, rapamycin, p38 inhibition, and PLA2R-siRNA in vitro. We
   found that IMN patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria have a
   significantly higher level of sPLA2-IB and fewer autophagosomes than
   those with non-nephrotic-range proteinuria. In vitro sPLA2-IB-induced
   insufficient autophagy in podocytes and promoted podocyte injury via
   activation of the mTOR/ULK1(ser757) signaling pathway. Moreover,
   inhibition of p38 MAPK evidently abrogated sPLA2-IB-induced autophagy
   and the activation of mTOR/ULK1(ser757). Additionally, PLA2R silencing
   demonstrated that sPLA2-IB-induced abnormal autophagy was also
   PLA2R-dependent. In conclusion, the results revealed that sPLA2-IB
   downregulated autophagy and contributed to podocyte injury via PLA2R
   though activation of the p38MAPK/mTOR/ULK1(ser757) signaling pathway.}},

Title = {{A comprehensive validation of the novel 8th edition of American Joint
   Committee on Cancer staging manual for the long-term survivals of
   patients with non-functional pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms}},
Journal = {{MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Histologically, the World Health Organization has classified pancreatic
   neuroendocrine neoplasms (p-NENs) into well-differentiated pancreatic
   neuroendocrine tumors (G1/G2 p-NETs) and poorly-differentiated
   pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (G3 p-NECs) based on tumor mitotic
   counts and Ki-67 index. Recently, the 8th edition of American Joint
   Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging manual
   has incorporated some major changes in 2017 that the TNM staging system
   for p-NENs should only be applied to well-differentiated G1/G2 p-NETs,
   while poorly-differentiated G3 p-NECs be classified according to the new
   system for pancreatic exocrine adenocarcinomas. However, this new manual
   for p-NENs has seldom been evaluated. Data of patients with both G1/G2
   and G3 non-functional p-NENs (NF-p-NENs) from our institution was
   retrospectively collected and analyzed using 2 new AJCC 8th staging
   systems. We also made survival comparisons between the 8th and 7th
   edition system separately for different subgroups. For G1/G2 NF-p-NETs,
   there were 52 patients classified in AJCC 8th edition stage I, 40 in
   stage II, 41 in stage III and 19 in stage IV. As for G3 NF-p-NECs, 17,
   19, 24, and 18 patients were respectively defined from AJCC 8th edition
   stage I to stage IV. In terms of the AJCC 7th staging system, the 230
   patients with NF-p-NENs were totally distributed from stage I to stage
   IV (94, 63, 36, 37, respectively). For the survival analysis of both
   G1/G2 NF-p-NETs and G3 NF-p-NECs, the AJCC 7th edition system failed to
   discriminate the survival differences when compared stage III with stage
   II or stage IV (P > .05), while the 8th edition ones could perfectly
   allocate patients into 4 statistically different groups (P < .05). The
   HCIs of AJCC 8th stage for G1/G2 NF-p-NETs {[}HCI=0.658, 95\% confidence
   interval (CI)=0.602-0.741] and stage for G3 NF-p-NECs (HCI=0.704, 95\%
   CI=0.595-0.813) was both statistically larger than those of AJCC 7th
   stage for different grading NF-p-NENs {[}(HCI=0.578, 95\%
   CI=0.557-0.649; P=.031), (HCI=0.546, 95\% CI=0.531-0.636; P = .019);
   respectively], indicating a more accurate predictive ability for the
   survivals of NF-p-NENs. Our data suggested the 2 new AJCC 8th staging
   systems were superior to its 7th edition for patients with both G1/G2
   NF-p-NETs and G3 NF-p-NECs.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research on wind-farm control methods has focused until now on
   maximising the efficiency and durability of farm operations, as verified
   for a normalised electrical layout. However, with the increase of
   turbine size and capacity, it is necessary to develop modifications of
   the farm management plan that can support the increasing demands of the
   wind-turbine industry. Here the authors propose a modification that
   focuses on a proportional reactive power-dispatch method that is applied
   to radial offshore farm networks. They improve a previously developed
   method of proportionally distributing reactive power commands by
   considering the actual configuration of an offshore platform. To confirm
   the applicability of this method in transient state, they examine case
   studies using a time-varying signal for a reactive power reference under
   fluctuating wind. Electromagnetic transients using DC software tools are
   used to estimate the electrical loss and verify the efficiency of this
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Gastroesophageal reflux disease is defined as bothersome
   symptoms and/or complications caused by the reflux of stomach contents.
   About 40-50\% of patients develop refractory gastroesophageal reflux
   disease (R-GERD), with poor improvement of symptoms with treatment. Many
   pathogenic mechanisms share in development of R-GERD, among which is the
   important role of T-helper 1 and T-helper 2 response mediated by
   cytokines. The interleukin-4 is a cytokine known of its
   anti-inflammatory effect. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the level
   of interleukin-4 in Egyptian patients with R-GERD versus those with
   GERD.
   PATIENTS AND Methods: Our study included 25 patients with reflux
   symptoms who received PPIs for less than 8 weeks with improvement of
   symptoms, versus 25 patients with refractory reflux symptoms who
   received PPIs for more than 8 weeks without improvement of symptoms.
   Interleukin-4 levels were assessed in both groups by ELISA.
   Results: There was a statistically significant difference between the
   two groups as regard interleukin-4 levels (p < 0.012) which was higher
   in the patients with (R-GERD), the mean level of IL-4 was 37.31 +/-
   56.07 in GERD group while in R-GERD group, it was 102.78 +/- 112.29. The
   diagnostic accuracy of interleukin-4 revealed a sensitivity of 56\% and
   specificity of 76\% at cutoff value >58.25 pg/ml, with an acceptable
   accuracy of 0.6.
   Conclusions: The present study concluded that IL-4 is significantly
   higher in patients with R GERD with cut off value > 58.25 pg/ml.
   Therapeutic strategies that modulate the production of IL-4 may provide
   a good solution for treatment of R GERD.}},

Abstract = {{Scavenger receptors are a superfamily of membrane-bound receptors that
   recognize both self and nonself targets. Scavenger receptor class A
   (SR-A) has five known members (SCARA1 to -5 or SR-A1 to -A5), which are
   type II transmembrane proteins that form homotrimers on the cell
   surface. SR-A members recognize various ligands and are involved in
   multiple biological pathways. Among them, SCARA5 can function as a
   ferritin receptor; however, the interaction between SCARA5 and ferritin
   has not been fully characterized. Here, we determine the crystal
   structures of the C-terminal scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR)
   domain of both human and mouse SCARA5 at 1.7 and 2.5 angstrom
   resolution, respectively, revealing three Ca2+-binding sites on the
   surface. Using biochemical assays, we show that the SRCR domain of
   SCARA5 recognizes ferritin in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and both L- and
   H-ferritin can be recognized by SCARA5 through the SRCR domain.
   Furthermore, the potential binding region of SCARA5 on the surface of
   ferritin is explored by mutagenesis studies. We also examine the
   interactions of ferritin with other SR-A members and find that SCARA1
   (SR-A1, CD204) and MARCO (SR-A2, SCARA2), which are highly expressed on
   macrophages, also interact with ferritin. By contrast, SCARA3 and
   SCARA4, the two SR-A members without the SRCR domain, have no detectable
   binding with ferritin. Overall, these results provide a mechanistic view
   regarding the interactions between the SR-A members and ferritin that
   may help to understand the regulation of ferritin homeostasis by
   scavenger receptors.}},

   cancer progression by binding to microRNA-377}},

Abstract = {{New Findings
   What is the central question of this study? Does hsa\_circ\_001653
   influence the development of gastric cancer (GC) and if so how?
   What is the main finding and its importance? Bioinformatics analysis
   revealed the presence of differentially expressed hsa\_circ\_001653 in
   GC and adjacent normal tissues, and this was strongly related to the
   pathology of patients with GC. Knockdown of hsa\_circ\_001653 suppressed
   the proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells, while inducing
   cell apoptosis via miR-377-mediated NR6A1 inhibition. The effect of
   hsa\_circ\_001653 and miR-377 on tumour growth in GC was further
   confirmed in vivo.
   Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of human mortality
   through malignant tumours. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified
   as binding to microRNAs (miRNAs) to modulate the progression of tumours.
   This study explores the role of hsa\_circ\_001653, a newly identified
   circRNA, in the development of GC. hsa\_circ\_001653 expression was
   measured in 86 paired normal and tumour tissues surgically resected from
   GC patients. Cross-talk between hsa\_circ\_001653 and microRNA-377
   (miR-377)/nuclear receptor subfamily 6, group A, member 1 (NR6A1) was
   assessed using bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assay,
   Ago2 immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis. A series of
   functional experiments were carried out to elucidate the role of
   hsa\_circ\_001653 in GC cell proliferation, invasion, migration and
   apoptosis, and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Nude mice were
   inoculated with GC cells for in vivo analysis. hsa\_circ\_001653 was
   found to be an up-regulated circRNA in GC tissues and cells.
   Down-regulation of hsa\_circ\_001653 inhibited GC cell proliferation,
   migration and invasion, while stimulating cell apoptosis.
   hsa\_circ\_001653 was found to bind to miR-377, which targeted NR6A1 and
   repressed its expression. Inhibition of miR-377 and overexpression of
   NR6A1 restored the proliferation, migration and invasion in GC cells
   lacking hsa\_circ\_001653. Furthermore, inhibition of hsa\_circ\_001653
   attenuated tumour growth in nude mice inoculated with GC cells.
   Collectively, the demonstration that hsa\_circ\_001653 exerts its
   anticancer effects by regulating the miR-377-NR6A1 axis increases our
   understanding of gastric cancer pathophysiology. The findings uncover
   new potential therapeutic targets for GC.}},

Abstract = {{With the fast development of effective and low-cost human skeleton
   capture systems, skeleton-based action recognition has attracted much
   attention recently. Most existing methods using Convolutional Neural
   Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) have achieved promising
   performance for skeleton-based action recognition. However, these
   approaches are limited in the ability to explore the rich
   spatial-temporal relational information. In this paper, we propose a new
   spatial-temporal model with an end-to-end bidirectional LSTM-CNN
   (BiLSTM-CNN). First, a hierarchical spatial-temporal dependent
   relational model is used to explore rich spatial-temporal information in
   the skeleton data. Then a new framework is proposed to fuse CNN and
   LSTM. In this framework, the skeleton data are built by the dependent
   relational model and serve as the input of the proposed network. Then
   LSTM is used to extract the temporal features, and followed by a
   standard CNN to explore the spatial information from the output of LSTM.
   Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed model on the NTU RGB+D, SBU Interaction and UTD-MHAD dataset.

Abstract = {{Background: In the context of tremendous progress in congenital
   cardiology, more attention has been given to patient-related outcomes,
   especially in assessing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of
   patients with congenital heart diseases (CHD). However, most studies
   have mainly focused on teenagers or adults and currently, few HRQoL
   controlled data is available in young children. This study aimed to
   evaluate HRQoL of children with CHD aged 5 to 7 y.o., in comparison with
   contemporary peers recruited in school, as well as the factors
   associated with HRQoL in this population.
   Methods: This multicentre controlled prospective cross-sectional study
   included 124 children with a CHD (mean age = 6.0 +/- 0.8 y, 45\% female)
   during their outpatient visit and 125 controls (mean age = 6.2 +/- 0.8
   y, 54\% female) recruited at school. A generic paediatric HRQoL
   instrument was used (PedsQL 4.0).
   Results: Self-reported HRQoL in children with CHD was similar to
   controls, overall (73.5 +/- 1.2 vs. 72.8 +/- 1.2, P = 0.7,
   respectively), and for each dimension. Parents-reported HRQoL was
   significantly lower in the CHD group than in controls. HRQoL was
   predicted by the disease severity and by repeated invasive cardiac
   procedures (surgery or catheterization).
   Conclusion: HRQoL in young children with CHD aged 5 to 7 years old was
   good and similar to controls. This study contributed to the growing body
   of knowledge on HRQoL in congenital cardiology and emphasized the need
   for child and family support in the most complex CHD.}},

Journal = {{ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY}},
Abstract = {{Based on employer responses to 6000 job applications, this article tests
   whether greater work experience lowers discrimination against job
   applicants of immigrant origin in the Finnish labour market. It does so
   by comparing the callbacks received in response to two sets of job
   applications: applications in which applicants of immigrant background
   had identical work experience as the majority applicant and those in
   which they had two years' more experience than the majority candidate.
   The article further investigates if additional experience elicits more
   callbacks in jobs in which higher work experience and a vocational
   diploma are required and when the vacancies are high-skilled. The
   findings of this empirical investigation suggest the presence of
   deep-seated ethnic hierarchies in the Finnish labour market. They
   clearly demonstrate that immigrants' chances of securing a job interview
   offer do not significantly change even when they possess substantially
   greater work experience than their majority counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Background Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria remain a major cause of
   morbidity and mortality globally. The present study was designed to
   investigate the in vitro antibacterial activities of crude methanol
   extract and constituents isolated by Column Chromatography (CC) from
   Cassia sieberiana bark (CSB) against ten MDR Gram-negative bacteria, as
   well as the mechanisms of action of the most active sample. Methods The
   antibacterial activity of the tested samples (extract, the fractions and
   their compounds isolated by CC and the structures obtained by exploiting
   H-1 and C-13 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra) in the presence
   and absence of an efflux pumps inhibitor, phenylalanine-arginine
   beta-naphthylamide (PA beta N), was evaluated using the micro-dilution
   method. The effects of the most active sample were evaluated on the cell
   growth kinetic and on the bacterial H+-ATPase proton pumps. Results
   Phytochemical composition of the crude extract showed a rather selective
   distribution of secondary metabolites (presence of polyphenols, tannins,
   steroids, triterpenes, flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins and absence of
   anthocyanins, anthraquinones). The tested samples displayed different
   antibacterial activities with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
   ranging from 64 to 512 mu g/mL. Crude extract (CS) and fraction CSc
   showed the highest inhibitory spectra, both inhibiting all of the
   studied bacteria except Enterobacter aerogenes EA27 strain. Fraction CSc
   exerted bactericidal effects on most bacteria meanwhile, crude extract
   (CS) and sub-fraction CSc2 exerted bacteriostatic effects. Compounds 1
   (spectaline) and 2 (iso-6-cassine) inhibited the growth of 70\%
   (Escherichia coli ATCC8739 and AG102, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC11296,
   Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC13048 and EA27, Providencia stuartii
   ATCC29916, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01) and 60\% (Escherichia coli
   ATCC8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC11296 and KP55, Providencia stuartii
   ATCC29916, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 and PA124) of bacteria
   respectively with MICs ranging from 128 to 512 mu g/mL. In the presence
   of PA beta N, the activities of crude extract CS, fraction CAc and
   sub-fraction CSc2 strongly increased on most bacteria strains as their
   MICs significantly decreased. Sub-fraction CSc2 inhibited the H+-ATPase
   proton pumps and altered growth kinetic of Escherichia coli ATCC8739.
   Conclusion The overall results justify the traditional use of C.
   sieberiana for the treatment of bacterial infections.}},

Title = {{A new species of the large-headed coastal marine turtle Solnhofia
   (Testudinata, Thalassochelydia) from the Late Jurassic of NW Switzerland}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: The large-headed turtle Solnhofia parsonsi is known by a
   handful of specimens from the Late Jurassic of Germany and Switzerland
   (maybe also France). Solnhofia parsonsi is traditionally regarded as a
   ``eurysternid{''} Thalassochelydia, a group of small to medium sized,
   mostly lagoonal or marginal turtles found almost exclusively in the Late
   Jurassic of Europe. More recently, Solnhofia parsonsi has been proposed
   to be a close relative of Sandownidae, an enigmatic group of Cretaceous
   to Paleogene turtles characterized by a derived cranial anatomy and a
   wider geographical distribution. Sandownids may therefore have evolved
   from thalassochelydian ancestors such as Solnhofia parsonsi.
   Methods: We herein describe new material of Solnhofia from the
   Kimmeridgian (Late Jurassic) of Porrentruy, NW Switzerland. The bulk of
   the material consists of an association of a cranium and over 180 shell
   bones found together in a block of marly limestone. A second cranium and
   a mandible from slightly younger, but nearby localities are also
   described.
   Results: We refer the new material to Solnhofia brachyrhyncha n. sp. The
   new species shares with Solnhofia parsonsi a relatively large head, an
   extensive secondary palate formed primarily by the maxillae, a greatly
   developed processus trochlearis oticum with a contribution from the
   parietal and quadratojugal, a large jugal-palatine contact in the floor
   of the fossa orbitalis, and a posteromedial process of the jugal running
   on the dorsal surface of the maxilla and pterygoid. Some of these
   characteristics are also present in sandownids, but our morphological
   study clearly shows that Solnhofia brachyrhyncha is closer to Solnhofia
   parsonsi than to any sandownids.
   Discussion: Solnhofia brachyrhyncha differs from Solnhofia parsonsi in
   many aspects, notably: a shortened and broader cranium, a shorter and
   posteriorly broader upper triturating surface with a slightly sinusoidal
   lateral margin and without contribution from the palatine, a processus
   trochlearis oticum more oblique in dorsal or ventral view and less
   concave in anterior view, choanae that do not extend posteriorly on the
   pterygoids, a more developed processus pterygoideus externus, a condylus
   mandibularis situated anterior to the level of the occipital plane, a
   greater ventral exposure of the parabasisphenoid, a mandible about as
   wide as long, a relatively short symphysis, a lower triturating surface
   widened posterolaterally thanks to the presence of large laterally
   projecting dentary tubercles, a stouter and shorter coronoid process, a
   splenial positioned more anteriorly along the mandibular ramus,
   costo-peripheral fontanelles extending more anteriorly and posteriorly
   along the costal series, and an escutcheon shaped central plastral
   fontanelle formed mostly by the hypoplastra. In addition to the
   morphology of the new species, we also briefly discuss about observable
   ontogenetic variations and possible taphonomic origin of the assemblage.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Finding adjuvants to local anesthetic used in interscalene
   block that could efficiently extend the analgesia duration has recently
   been the focus of researchers. The aim of the work was to determine
   whether the addition of perineural dexamethasone to bupivacaine
   in-ultrasound guided interscalene block would prolong the duration of
   sensory analgesia in patients undergoing shoulder surgery.
   Results: This prospective, randomized, double-blinded study comprised 50
   patients. They were randomly subdivided into 2 groups: group C
   {[}control] and group D {[}dexamethasone]. We noted a significant
   difference regarding the timing for the first rescue analgesia being
   shorter in group C than in group D with a P value < 0.001. Regarding
   postoperative analgesia, higher Ketolac consumption was noticed in group
   C than in group D. Patients from both groups showed excellent analgesic
   effects with VAS score less than 2 points up to 6 h postoperative then
   patients in group C had a higher VAS score compared to group D, and the
   difference was statistically significant (P value < 0.05). We also
   noticed an increase in the heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure
   in group C than in group D at 12 h and 24 h postoperatively.
   Conclusion: We concluded that the addition of 8 mg of perineural
   dexamethasone to 30 ml of 0.5\% bupivacaine showed improvement in the
   postoperative analgesia in shoulder surgery without obvious
   complications.}},

Title = {{Validating the Essen Climate Evaluation Schema modified for people with

Abstract = {{Background Research has shown that an empowering and nurturing yet
   challenging work climate is beneficial for people receiving clinical
   services as it increases patient satisfaction, motivation, engagement,
   therapeutic alliance and functional improvement. Therefore, for
   inpatients, monitoring, encouraging and understanding ward climate holds
   considerable potential for improving forensic mental health services. To
   date, the most widely employed tool for ward-climate, the Essen Climate
   Evaluation Schema (EssenCES), has been evidenced as useful in medium and
   high security hospitals, but little tested with people with learning
   disabilities or in low security services.
   Aims To establish the internal consistency and factor validity of the
   EssenCES, modified for easier reading, in a low secure hospital unit for
   people with learning disabilities.
   Method Language in the EssenCES was simplified and picture supplements
   added to facilitate comprehension. Patients completed the scale as part
   of their clinical routine, supported by National Health Service (NHS)
   employed psychology assistants. The research team, entirely independent
   of NHS staff, extracted data from the electronic records of purposively
   sampled residents in a low-secure forensic hospital setting for people
   with learning disabilities.
   Findings Two hundred and twenty-seven records (70\% men) were acquired.
   The EssenCES was shown to have good factor validity and retained the
   original three factor model including the subscales: therapeutic hold,
   safety and cohesion. One single-item from the `therapeutic hold'
   subscale was removed to improve the internal consistency (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions This study adds preliminary support for the use of the
   EssenCES (with removal of one item) in individuals with learning
   disabilities within low-risk secure forensic hospital settings.}},

Title = {{Efficient solution of Boolean satisfiability problems with digital
   memcomputing}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Boolean satisfiability is a propositional logic problem of interest in
   multiple fields, e.g., physics, mathematics, and computer science.
   Beyond a field of research, instances of the SAT problem, as it is
   known, require efficient solution methods in a variety of applications.
   It is the decision problem of determining whether a Boolean formula has
   a satisfying assignment, believed to require exponentially growing time
   for an algorithm to solve for the worst-case instances. Yet, the
   efficient solution of many classes of Boolean formulae eludes even the
   most successful algorithms, not only for the worst-case scenarios, but
   also for typical-case instances. Here, we introduce a memory-assisted
   physical system (a digital memcomputing machine) that, when its
   non-linear ordinary differential equations are integrated numerically,
   shows evidence for polynomially-bounded scalability while solving
   ``hard{''} planted-solution instances of SAT, known to require
   exponential time to solve in the typical case for both complete and
   incomplete algorithms. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that the
   physical system can efficiently solve the SAT problem in continuous
   time, without the need to introduce chaos or an exponentially growing
   energy. The efficiency of the simulations is related to the collective
   dynamical properties of the original physical system that persist in the
   numerical integration to robustly guide the solution search even in the
   presence of numerical errors. We anticipate our results to broaden
   research directions in physics-inspired computing paradigms ranging from
   theory to application, from simulation to hardware implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Background Over the past four decades, drought episodes in the Eastern
   Mediterranean Region (EMR) of the of the World Health Organization (WHO)
   have gradually become more widespread, prolonged and frequent. We aimed
   to map hotspot countries and identified key strategic actions for health
   consequences. Methods We reviewed scientific literature and WHO EMR
   documentation on trends and patterns of the drought health consequences
   from 1990 through 2019. Extensive communication was also carried out
   with EMR WHO country offices to retrieve information on ongoing
   initiatives to face health consequences due to drought. An index score
   was developed to categorize countries according vulnerability factors
   towards drought. Results A series of complex health consequences are due
   to drought in EMR, including malnutrition, vector-borne diseases, and
   water-borne diseases. The index score indicated how Afghanistan, Yemen
   and Somalia are ``hotspots{''} due to poor population health status and
   access to basic sanitation as well as other elements such as food
   insecurity, displacement and conflicts/political instability. WHO
   country offices effort is towards enhancing access to water and
   sanitation and essential healthcare services including immunization and
   psychological support, strengthening disease surveillance and response,
   and risk communication. Conclusions Drought-related health effects in
   the WHO EMR represent a public health emergency. Strengthening
   mitigation activities and additional tailored efforts are urgently
   needed to overcome context-specific gaps and weaknesses, with specific
   focus on financing, accountability and enhanced data availability.}},

   densirostris: one on a US Navy range in The Bahamas and one nearby in an
   area less exposed to sonar. The variables most strongly correlated with
   beaked whale habitat use were related to the distribution of deep-sea
   squid (mode spacing, peak depth, and 100 m scale variability). All squid
   metrics were more favorable for beaked whales at the less exposed site
   than those on the range. To develop a generalized functional
   relationship between prey resources and beaked whale habitat use, data
   from The Bahamas were combined with comparable data from another Navy
   range and the larger beaked whale, Ziphius cavirostris. A power-law
   relationship was observed between a normalized metric of prey quality
   and whale habitat use. A critical threshold in prey characteristics,
   below which beaked whales appear unlikely to be successful, but above
   which small changes in resource availability enable large gains for
   predators, was observed. This implies that modest changes in the
   behavior of individual whales associated with disturbance can have
   consequential population effects. Our results elucidate the ecological
   realities of these elusive and sensitive beaked whales, and the
   importance of environmental context in effective spatial planning for
   the deep sea.}},

Title = {{Effects of COVID-19 lockdown on heart rate variability}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Strict lockdown rules were imposed to the French population from 17
   March to 11 May 2020, which may result in limited possibilities of
   physical activity, modified psychological and health states. This report
   is focused on HRV parameters kinetics before, during and after this
   lockdown period.
   Methods
   95 participants were included in this study (27 women, 68 men, 37 +/- 11
   years, 176 +/- 8 cm, 71 +/- 12 kg), who underwent regular orthostatic
   tests (a 5-minute supine followed by a 5-minute standing recording of
   heart rate (HR)) on a regular basis before (BSL), during (CFN) and after
   (RCV) the lockdown. HR, power in low- and high-frequency bands (LF, HF,
   respectively) and root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD)
   were computed for each orthostatic test, and for each position.
   Subjective well-being was assessed on a 0-10 visual analogic scale
   (VAS). The participants were split in two groups, those who reported an
   improved well-being (WB+, increase >2 in VAS score) and those who did
   not (WB-) during CFN.
   Results
   Out of the 95 participants, 19 were classified WB+ and 76 WB-. There was
   an increase in HR and a decrease in RMSSD when measured supine in CFN
   and RCV, compared to BSL in WB-, whilst opposite results were found in
   WB+ (i.e. decrease in HR and increase in RMSSD in CFN and RCV; increase
   in LF and HF in RCV). When pooling data of the three phases, there were
   significant correlations between VAS and HR, RMSSD, HF, respectively, in
   the supine position; the higher the VAS score (i.e., subjective
   well-being), the higher the RMSSD and HF and the lower the HR. In
   standing position, HRV parameters were not modified during CFN but RMSSD
   was correlated to VAS.
   Conclusion
   Our results suggest that the strict COVID-19 lockdown likely had
   opposite effects on French population as 20\% of participants improved
   parasympathetic activation (RMSSD, HF) and rated positively this period,
   whilst 80\% showed altered responses and deteriorated well-being. The
   changes in HRV parameters during and after the lockdown period were in
   line with subjective well-being responses. The observed recordings may
   reflect a large variety of responses (anxiety, anticipatory stress,
   change on physical activity horizontal ellipsis ) beyond the scope of
   the present study. However, these results confirmed the usefulness of
   HRV as a non-invasive means for monitoring well-being and health in this
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Robots in traditional fabrication applications act as passive
   participants in the process of creation-simply performing a set of
   predetermined actions to materialize a completed design. We propose a
   novel bottom-up design framework in which robots are instead given the

   This paper describes how two 6-axis industrial robotic arms were used to
   cooperatively aggregate a collection of solid spherical units. The
   branching spatial structure being constructed is unplanned at the outset
   of this process, and is instead designed in pseudo-realtime during
   construction. This `design-as-you-build' approach relies on robotic
   input, in the form of path-planning constraints, in tandem with human
   evaluation and decision-making. The resulting structure emerges from a
   human-robot design collaboration operating within the specified physical

Volume = {{63}},

Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Hydrogen sensors are of great importance to detect leakage in time
   because the hydrogen-air mixture is highly flammable. Based on optical
   fiber-based configurations reported so far, using palladium coating only
   does not meet stringent performance targets, such as fast response time
   and limited deactivation caused by poisoning. Here, a palladium-gold
   alloy-coated optical fiber hydrogen sensor, i.e., highly tilted fiber
   Bragg grating (TFBG), was proposed by using its narrow bandwidth
   cladding modes whose effective refractive index (ERI) extends to 1.0
   where the gas measurement is possible, which led to faster specific
   hydrogen measurement response time (a shorter stabilization time during
   the association and dissociation phases less than 20 s and 30 s,
   respectively) and improved deactivation resistance (higher than 99\% per
   test cycle). Meanwhile, the temperature cross-sensitivity can be
   eliminated via referencing the ``target{''} spectral combs to the core
   mode. We are sure that this promising configuration extends research
   directions for rapid, repeatable and high deactivation-resistance in
   hydrogen gas detection.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral
   therapy (ART) represent the cornerstones of HIV infection prevention and
   treatment. However, despite their high efficacy, the need to take daily
   oral pill(s) negatively impacts long-term patient adherence. In some
   cases, it can also be associated with drug-drug interactions and adverse
   gastrointestinal effects, as well as being a constant reminder to
   individuals of their HIV status. The availability of long-acting
   non-orally administered antiretroviral drugs could, therefore, be
   extremely useful. Cabotegravir (CAB) is a second-generation integrase
   strand transfer inhibitor, characterized by a relatively high genetic
   barrier and good antiretroviral potency, which is administrable as a
   long-acting injectable suspension (LAI CAB).
   Areas covered: The authors present and discuss the efficacy and
   available safety data of LAI CAB, either when co-administered with
   rilpivirine (RPV; LAI CAB + RPV) for the treatment of HIV infection, or
   when used as single agent for PrEP.
   Expert opinion: Cabotegravir has the potential to play a primary role in
   the treatment and prevention of HIV infection. The future availability
   of LAI CAB + RPV and LAI CAB may mark the beginning of an era of LAI ART
   and PrEP, respectively.}},

Title = {{Comparing multiple statistical software for multiple-indicator,
   multiple-cause modeling: an application of gender disparity in adult
   cognitive functioning using MIDUS II dataset}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Background The multiple-indicator, multiple-cause model (MIMIC)
   incorporates covariates of interest in the factor analysis. It is a
   special case of structural equation modeling (SEM), which is modeled
   under latent variable framework. The MIMIC model provides rigorous
   results and becomes broadly available in multiple statistical software.
   The current study introduces the MIMIC model and how it can be
   implemented using statistical software packages SAS CALIS procedure, R
   lavaan package, and Mplus version 8.0. Methods In this paper, we first
   discussed the formulation of the MIMIC model with regard to model
   specification and identification. We then demonstrated the empirical
   application of the MIMIC model with the Midlife in the United States II
   (MIDUS II) Study (N = 4109) using SAS CALIS procedure, R lavaan package
   and Mplus version 8.0 to examine gender disparities in cognitive
   functioning. The input, output, and diagram syntaxes of the three
   statistical software packages were also presented. Results In terms of
   data structure, all three statistical programs can be conducted using
   both raw data and empirical covariance matrix. SAS and R are
   comprehensive statistical analytic packages and encompass numerous data
   manipulation capacities. Mplus is designed primarily for latent variable
   modeling and has far more modeling flexibility compared to SAS and R,
   but limited in data manipulation. Differences in model results from the
   three statistical programs are trivial. Overall, the results show that
   while men show better performance in executive function than women,
   women demonstrate better episodic memory than men. Conclusions Our study
   demonstrates the utility of the MIMIC model in its empirical
   application, fitted with three popular statistical software packages.
   Results from our models align with empirical findings from previous
   research. We provide coding procedures and examples with detailed
   explanations in the hopes of providing a concise tutorial for
   researchers and methodologists interested in incorporating latent
   constructs with multiple indicators and multiple covariates in their
   research projects. Future researchers are encouraged to adopt this
   flexible and rigorous modeling approach.}},

Title = {{Impacts of Leader Humility Between Authority and Trustworthiness on
   Compliance: Tests of Three-Way Interaction}},
Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS}},
Abstract = {{This study aims to examine how leader humility affects the relationship
   between authority and trustworthiness, and its effect on subordinate
   compliance. This study further addresses the reliability and validity
   issue to advance the measurement of humility; 300 participants
   consisting of leader-subordinate dyads of 50 leaders and 250
   subordinates contributed to the data collections. This study found that
   both trustworthiness and authority have impact on subordinate
   compliance. Through three-way moderating analysis, this study further
   revealed that a leader's high humility, along with high trustworthiness
   under high authority results in the highest compliance, whereas a
   leader's high humility combined with low trustworthiness under low
   authority leads to the lowest compliance. Moreover, although a leader's
   personal background showed no relationship with the degree of leader
   humility, divergent combinations of leader-subordinate backgrounds were
   found to affect the degree of humility. Based on our findings, we
   propose that to effectively increase compliance, leader humility must be
   viewed as a strength when combined with high trustworthiness in high
   authority situations. This study may prompt future research in exploring
   humility in the context of virtue versus power, and the effects of
   humility in leadership. The implications of these findings for both
   theory and practice are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep-disordered breathing and sleep-related symptoms are frequent in
   patients with severe amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We aimed to
   describe sleep quality, sleep structure, and the occurrence of
   sleep-disordered breathing in patients with early ALS, at the time of
   initial evaluation in a tertiary care center. Sleep-related symptoms
   were collected using questionnaires, the Pittsburgh Sleep quality Index
   (PSQI), and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Sleep was studied by inpatient
   overnight polysomnography. Fourteen men and 13 women (age 66 +/- 12
   years, ALSFRS-R 39 +/- 6) were included, among which 12 patients had
   disease with bulbar onset. Eighteen (69\%) patients complained of
   insomnia, fifteen of which (55\%) reported poor sleep quality (PSQI >
   5). No patient had an Epworth Sleepiness Scale > 10. Respiratory and
   polysomnography characteristics were similar between patients with poor
   or good sleep quality. Sleep efficiency and REM sleep duration were
   normal relative to normative values, while wake after sleep onset was
   increased. Fifteen patients had obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (8
   mild, 3 moderate, and 4 severe). No patient had central apnea syndrome.
   Insomnia was highly prevalent in patients with early ALS, independent of
   respiratory impairment. Poor sleep quality was strongly associated with
   insomnia.}},

Title = {{Estimation of US Children's Educational Attainment and Years of Life
   Lost Associated With Primary School Closures During the Coronavirus
   Disease 2019 Pandemic}},
Journal = {{JAMA NETWORK OPEN}},

Abstract = {{This decision analytical model estimates the potential years of life
   lost among US primary school-aged children associated with school
   closures during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
   Importance United States primary school closures during the 2020
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected millions of
   children, with little understanding of the potential health outcomes
   associated with educational disruption. Objective To estimate the
   potential years of life lost (YLL) associated with the COVID-19 pandemic
   conditioned on primary schools being closed or remaining open. Design,
   Setting, and Participants This decision analytical model estimated the
   association between school closures and reduced educational attainment
   and the association between reduced educational attainment and life
   expectancy using publicly available data sources, including data for
   2020 from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US
   Social Security Administration, and the US Census Bureau. Direct
   COVID-19 mortality and potential increases in mortality that might have
   resulted if school opening led to increased transmission of COVID-19
   were also estimated. Main Outcomes and Measures Years of life lost.
   Results A total of 24.2 million children aged 5 to 11 years attended
   public schools that were closed during the 2020 pandemic, losing a
   median of 54 (interquartile range, 48-62.5) days of instruction. Missed
   instruction was associated with a mean loss of 0.31 (95\% credible
   interval {[}CI], 0.10-0.65) years of final educational attainment for
   boys and 0.21 (95\% CI, 0.06-0.46) years for girls. Summed across the
   population, an estimated 5.53 million (95\% CI, 1.88-10.80) YLL may be
   associated with school closures. The Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention reported a total of 88241 US deaths from COVID-19 through the
   end of May 2020, with an estimated 1.50 million (95\% CI, 1.23-1.85
   million) YLL as a result. Had schools remained open, 1.47 million (95\%
   credible interval, 0.45-2.59) additional YLL could have been expected as
   a result, based on results of studies associating school closure with
   decreased pandemic spread. Comparing the full distributions of estimated
   YLL under both ``schools open{''} and ``schools closed{''} conditions,
   the analysis observed a 98.1\% probability that school opening would
   have been associated with a lower total YLL than school closure.
   Conclusions and Relevance In this decision analytical model of years of
   life potentially lost under differing conditions of school closure, the
   analysis favored schools remaining open. Future decisions regarding
   school closures during the pandemic should consider the association
   between educational disruption and decreased expected lifespan and give
   greater weight to the potential outcomes of school closure on children's
   health.
   Question Based on the current understanding of the associations between
   school disruption and decreased educational attainment and between
   decreased educational attainment and lower life expectancy, is it
   possible to estimate the association between school closure during the
   coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and decreased life expectancy of
   publicly educated primary school-aged children in the United States?
   Findings This decision analytical model found that missed instruction
   during 2020 could be associated with an estimated 5.53 million years of
   life lost. This loss in life expectancy was likely to be greater than
   would have been observed if leaving primary schools open had led to an
   expansion of the first wave of the pandemic. Meaning These findings
   suggest that the decision to close US public primary schools in the
   early months of 2020 may be associated with a decrease in life
   expectancy for US children.}},

Title = {{Leadership contingencies in the retention of women in higher education}},
Journal = {{SA JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Orientation: Providing leadership opportunities and eliminating barriers
   to advance to or remain in leadership positions may influence the
   retention of women at academic institutions.
   Research purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact
   of leadership contingencies on the retention of women.
   Motivation for the study: Women could be better equipped to succeed in
   leadership roles if more is known about the challenges they face to
   advance to or remain in leadership positions and how these challenges
   should be managed to ensure their retention.
   Research approach/design and method: A quantitative research approach
   was followed in this study and a questionnaire was used to collect data.
   A non-probability simple random sample of 2000 female employees from an
   academic institution in South Africa was drawn and a total of 311
   questionnaires were completed, with a response rate 15.6\%. Principal
   axis factor analysis with a Varimax rotation extracted six leadership
   contingency factors.
   Main findings: The factor analysis identified six leadership
   contingencies that play a significant role in the retention of women in
   leadership positions: barriers to advancement, capabilities of women,
   acceptance of women as leaders, work-life balance, advancement
   opportunities and success beliefs. All of these factors were
   significantly related to retention factors, such as the fulfilment of
   unique needs, growth opportunities, recognition, pleasant work
   conditions, sound relationships and support.
   Practical/managerial implications: This study contributes to a better
   understanding of the complexity in the career progression and retention
   of women in leadership positions.
   Contribution/value-add: An understanding of challenges faced by women in
   leadership positions would enable organisations to implement retention
   strategies and allow institutions to capitalise on the value women could
   add to the management of academic institutions.}},

Abstract = {{Kassinula is a monotypic genus of small frog in the family Hyperoliidae,
   only represented by Kassinula wittei. This species morphologically
   resembles both Kassina Girard, 1853 and Afrixalus Laurent, 1944, and its
   taxonomic status has been debated for decades. It has previously been
   subsumed within Kassina, and is currently placed as a sister genus to
   Afrixalus, although it has not been included in any phylogenetic studies
   until now. This species is poorly represented in museum collections and
   is only known from fewer than 35 specimens from southern Democratic
   Republic of the Congo and adjacent Zambia. Newly collected material from
   central Angola, a range extension of 400-800 km west of previously known
   localities, allowed us to revisit the taxonomic placement of the genus
   with the aid of phylogenetic analysis and shed light on its geographic
   distribution, morphology and natural history. Although our phylogenetic
   analysis is limited to a single mitochondrial gene (16S), we place
   Kassinula in the subfamily Hyperoliinae and closely related to
   Afrixalus, with a high degree of confidence. Further phylogenetic
   studies are needed before formally synonymising Afrixalus with
   Kassinula.}},

Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Higgs bundles are a central tool used to study a range of intersecting
   brane systems in string compactifications. Solutions to the internal
   gauge theory equations of motion for the corresponding worldvolume
   theories of brans give rise to different low energy effective field
   theories. This has been heavily used in the study of M-theory on local
   G(2) spaces and F-theory on local elliptically fibered CalabiYau
   fourfolds. In this paper we show that the 3D N = 1 effective field
   theory defined by M-theory on a local spin(7) space unifies the Higgs
   bundle data associated with 4D N = 1 M- and F-theory vacua. This 3D
   system appears as an interface with finite thickness between different
   4D vacua. We develop the general formalism of M-theory on such local
   spin(7) spaces and build explicit interpolating solutions. This provides
   a complementary local gauge theory analysis of a recently proposed
   approach to constructing spin(7) spaces from generalized connected sums.}},

Title = {{Seasonality in the Brazilian Pantanal influences avian functional
   diversity}},
Journal = {{STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Abstract = {{Seasonality significantly affects environmental changes in the Pantanal,
   especially during wet and dry periods. Inundation and drought impact the
   onset of flowering and fruiting and the occurrence of insects. Because
   such resources may vary across seasons, it is expected that avian
   functional diversity also changes. We examine how functional diversity
   changed over time, as measured by functional richness and functional
   divergence. For functional richness, we observed a functionally
   overdispersed bird community over the seasons, whereas for functional
   divergence, two different patterns were found: (1) functionally
   overdispersed bird communities during the wet and receding seasons and
   (2) functionally clustered avian communities in the dry and rising
   seasons. The diversity of functional groups did not significantly vary
   across the seasons, as expected, but varied between forests and
   savannas. The environment has restricted resources in certain seasons,
   benefiting species with specific functional characteristics, however,
   bird species in the Pantanal are often generalists adapted to using a
   wide variety of food resources. Although the habitat turnover rate is an
   important factor that influences bird species composition across
   seasons, the changes in species composition still allowed the
   maintenance of certain functional characteristics, contributing to
   conservation of the existing functional groups in the ecosystem.}},

Title = {{Common garden experiments to study local adaptation need to account for
   population structure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Common garden experiments are precious to study adaptive phenomenon and
   adaptive potential, in that they allow to study local adaptation without
   the confounding effect of phenotypic plasticity. The Q(ST) - F-ST
   comparison framework, comparing genetic differentiation at the
   phenotypic and molecular level, is the usual way to test and measure
   whether local adaptation influences phenotypic divergence between
   populations.
   Here, we highlight that the assumptions behind the expected equality
   Q(ST) = F-ST under neutrality correspond to a very simple model of
   population genetics. While the equality might, on average, be robust to
   violation of such assumptions, more complex population structure can
   generate strong evolutionary noise.
   Synthesis. We highlight recent methodological developments aimed at
   overcoming this issue and at providing a more general framework to
   detect local adaptation, using less restrictive assumptions. We invite
   empiricists to look into these methods and theorists to continue
   developing even more general methods.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Guided by parental investment theory and social role theory, this study
   aimed to understand current contradictory results regarding sex
   differences in response to infant faces by considering the effect of
   gender role orientation. We recruited 300 adults in China and asked them
   to complete an Interest in Infants questionnaire and a Bem Sex Role
   Inventory and then administered a behavioral assessment that used
   unfamiliar infant faces with varying expressions (laughing, neutral, and
   crying) as stimuli to gauge three components of motivation towards
   infants (i.e., liking, representational responding, and evoked
   responding). The results demonstrated that sex differences emerged only
   in self-reported interest in infants, but no difference was found
   between the sexes in terms of their hedonic reactions to infant faces.
   Furthermore, femininity was found to correlate with preferences for
   infants in both verbal and visual tests, but significant interactive
   effects of feminine traits and sex were found only in the behavioral
   test. The findings indicated that men's responses to infants were
   influenced more by their feminine traits than were women's responses,
   potentially explaining the greater extent to which paternal (vs.
   maternal) investment is facultative.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{This study aimed to characterize honey of Melipona scutellaris regarding
   its physicochemical parameters using the electronic tongue (e-tongue)
   technique combined with the multivariate statistical analysis for honey
   differentiation. Physicochemical parameters were evaluated following
   official methods of chemical analyses. A potentiometric electronic
   tongue with 16 cross-sensitivity sensors was used for the analysis. The
   Principal Component Analysis and the Cluster Analysis distinguished two
   groups for the sample set in the evaluation of physicochemical
   parameters, similar to results found using the electronic tongue. We
   verified a correlation greater than 0.70 between the profile of
   potentiometric signals and values of pH, ashes, electrical conductivity,
   HMF, diastase activity, reducing sugars, and apparent sucrose. The
   combined use of the electronic tongue with the statistical analysis
   showed the similarity between samples through the formation of two
   groups of the sample set. The electronic tongue may be used as a
   complement to traditional techniques of analyses to determine honey
   physicochemical parameters, constituting a promising tool in association
   with the multivariate statistical analysis.}},

Title = {{The MD-PhD program in Geneva: a 10-year analysis of graduate
   demographics and outcomes}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: MD-PhD programs confer degrees that empower medical doctors
   with in-depth scientific skills to contribute to biomedical research and
   academic medicine, alongside clinical practice. Whilst the career
   options and research opportunities related to graduates following these
   programs in the US are well documented, little is known about their
   European counterparts. In this article, we studied graduates who had
   completed the MD-PhD program at the University of Geneva between 2010
   and 2019.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was performed in April 2019, targeting
   all medical doctors who had obtained the MD-PhD degree from the
   University of Geneva since 2010. Demographics, opinions, and career
   outcomes of the MD-PhD graduates were assessed through an online
   anonymous questionnaire.
   Results: Twenty-one questionnaires were collected from 31 MD-PhD
   graduates (response rate 65.5\%). Most respondents (57.1\%) had
   performed an MD-PhD training in basic sciences; however, only 14.3\% had
   pursued this type of research thereafter. Most of the respondents held a
   position at a University hospital (90.5\%), although a significant
   number of them were no longer involved in research in their current
   position (28.6\%). 85.7\% mentioned obstacles and challenges in
   combining clinical duties with research. Despite this, the majority
   (85.7\%) declared that the MD-PhD degree had given them advantages in
   their career path, granting access to clinical and academic positions,
   as well as funding.
   Conclusions: Graduates from the MD-PhD program in Geneva were for the
   most part, satisfied with their training. However, because of the
   challenges and obstacles in combining clinical duties with research, the
   implementation of research activities in their current position proved
   difficult.}},

Abstract = {{Multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are an increasing
   public health threat due to rapidly rising resistance toward beta-lactam
   antibiotics. The hydrolytic enzymes called beta-lactamases are
   responsible for a large proportion of the resistance phenotype.
   beta-Lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) can be administered in combination with
   beta-lactam antibiotics to negate the action of the beta-lactamases,
   thereby restoring activity of the beta-lactam. Newly developed BLIs
   offer some advantage over older BLIs in terms of enzymatic spectrum but
   are limited to the intravenous route of administration. Reported here is
   a novel, orally bioavailable diazabicyclooctane (DBO) beta-lactamase
   inhibitor. This new DBO, ETX1317, contains an endocyclic carbon-carbon
   double bond and a fluoroacetate activating group and exhibits broad
   spectrum activity against class A, C, and D serine beta-lactamases. The
   ester prodrug of ETX1317, ETX0282, is orally bioavailable and, in
   combination with cefpodoxime proxetil, is currently in development as an
   oral therapy for multidrug resistant and carbapenem-resistant

Abstract = {{FGF19 signaling through the FGFR4/beta-klotho receptor complex has been
   shown to be a key driver of growth and survival in a subset of
   hepatocellular carcinomas, making selective FGFR4 inhibition an
   attractive treatment opportunity. A kinome-wide sequence alignment
   highlighted a poorly conserved cysteine residue within the FGFR4
   ATP-binding site at position 552, two positions beyond the gate-keeper
   residue. Several strategies for targeting this cysteine to identify
   FGFR4 selective inhibitor starting points are summarized which made use
   of both rational and unbiased screening approaches. The optimization of
   a 2-formylquinoline amide hit series is described in which the aldehyde
   makes a hemithioacetal reversible-covalent interaction with cysteine
   552. Key challenges addressed during the optimization are improving the
   FGFR4 potency, metabolic stability, and solubility leading ultimately to
   the highly selective first-in-class clinical candidate roblitinib.}},

   when CDW is suppressed, we present data from STM and ac susceptibility
   measurements that show no direct competition between CDW order and
   superconductivity. Both coexist over most of the intercalation range,
   with uniform superconductivity over length scales that exceed the
   superconducting coherence length. This is despite persisting short-range
   CDW order and increased scattering from the Pd intercalation. While
   superconductivity is insensitive to local defects in either of the
   bidirectional CDWs, vestiges of the Fermi-level distortions are observed
   in the properties of the superconducting state.}},

Title = {{Structure and function of epipelagic mesozooplankton and their response
   to dust deposition events during the spring PEACETIME cruise in the
   Mediterranean Sea}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{5417-5441}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{The PEACETIME cruise (May-June 2017) was a basin-scale survey covering
   the Provencal, Algerian, Tyrrhenian, and Ionian basins during the
   post-spring bloom period and was dedicated to tracking the impact of
   Saharan dust deposition events on the Mediterranean Sea pelagic
   ecosystem. Two such events occurred during this period, and the cruise
   strategy allowed for the study of the initial phase of the ecosystem
   response to one dust event in the Algerian Basin (during 5 d at the
   so-called ``FAST long-duration station{''}) as well as the study of a
   latter response to another dust event in the Tyrrhenian Basin (by
   sampling from 5 to 12 d after the deposition). This paper documents the
   structural and functional patterns of the zooplankton component during
   this survey, including their responses to these two dust events. The
   mesozooplankton were sampled at 12 stations using nets with two
   different mesh sizes (100 and 200 mu m) that were mounted on a Bongo
   frame for vertical hauls within the depth layer from 0 to 300 m.
   The Algerian and Tyrrhenian basins were found to be quite similar in
   terms of hydrological and biological variables, which clearly
   differentiated them from the northern Provencal Basin and the eastern
   Ionian Basin. In general, total mesozooplankton showed reduced
   variations in abundance and biomass values over the whole area, with a
   noticeable contribution from the small size fraction (<500 mu m) of up
   to 50 \% with respect to abundance and 25 \% with respect to biomass.
   This small size fraction makes a significant contribution (15 \%-21 \%)
   to the mesozooplankton fluxes (carbon demand, grazing pressure,
   respiration, and excretion), which is estimated using allometric
   relationships to the mesozooplankton size spectrum at all stations. The
   taxonomic structure was dominated by copepods, mainly cyclopoid and
   calanoid copepods, and was completed by appendicularians, ostracods, and
   chaetognaths. Zooplankton taxa assemblages, analyzed using multivariate
   analysis and rank frequency diagrams, slightly differed between basins,
   which is in agreement with recently proposed Mediterranean regional
   patterns.
   However, the strongest changes in the zooplankton community were linked
   to the abovementioned dust deposition events. A synoptic analysis of the
   two dust events observed in the Tyrrhenian and Algerian basins, based on
   the rank frequency diagrams and a derived index proposed by Mouillot and
   Lepretre (2000), delivered a conceptual model of a virtual time series
   of the zooplankton community responses after a dust deposition event.
   The initial phase before the deposition event (state 0) was dominated by
   small-sized cells consumed by their typical zooplankton filter feeders
   (small copepods and appendicularians). The disturbed phase during the
   first 5 d following the deposition event (state 1) then induced a strong
   increase in filter feeders and grazers of larger cells as well as the
   progressive attraction of carnivorous species, leading to a sharp
   increase in the zooplankton distribution index. Afterward, this index
   progressively decreased from day 5 to day 12 following the event,
   highlighting a diversification of the community (state 2). A 3-week
   delay was estimated for the index to return to its initial value,
   potentially indicating the recovery time of a Mediterranean zooplankton
   community after a dust event.
   To our knowledge, PEACETIME is the first in situ study that has allowed
   for the observation of mesozooplankton responses before and soon after
   natural Saharan dust depositions. The change in the rank frequency
   diagrams of the zooplankton taxonomic structure is an interesting tool
   to highlight short-term responses of zooplankton to episodic dust
   deposition events. Obviously dust-stimulated pelagic productivity
   impacts up to mesozooplankton in terms of strong but short changes in
   taxa assemblages and trophic structure, with potential implications for
   oligotrophic systems such as the Mediterranean Sea.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of Review This review seeks to provide a summary of recent
   literature to help guide practitioners in the management of acute pain
   due to traumatic injury in patients with chronic pain as well as with
   pre-injury opioid use. It also seeks to illuminate areas in need of
   further investigation. Recent Findings There is a paucity of
   professional guidelines and clinical trials on this topic, despite the
   disproportionate rates of preexisting opioid use and chronic pain in
   trauma patients, and the contributions of these issues to inferior
   outcomes. The management of these patients is complex, requiring
   knowledge of opioid conversions, medication-assisted treatment (MAT),
   and non-opioid analgesic options. Provider education, standardized
   assessments and screening tools, evolving multidisciplinary approach,
   careful management of pre-injury therapy, use of non-opioid adjuvant
   therapies, early discharge planning, and close follow-up are essential
   to achieving adequate acute pain control in these patients, which can
   contribute to better short- and long-term outcomes.}},

Title = {{German concessives as TPs, JPs and ActPs}},
Journal = {{GLOSSA-A JOURNAL OF GENERAL LINGUISTICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{The concessive relation is said to not be expressible by a central
   adverbial clause (CAC) but by a peripheral adverbial clause (PAC) or a
   non-integrated dependent clause (NonIC). This is true in the standard
   case. The paper argues that this ban on the appearance of the concessive
   as a CAC stems from the fact that the concessive relation standardly
   involves a judgement, which is due to a conception of an expected course
   of events that is associated as an implicature with the concessive
   relation. However, based on d'Avis (2016), it is shown that if a
   concessive just stands in opposition to a conditional that is salient in
   the context, it does not involve a judgement and can appear as a CAC.
   A judgement constitutes a private act of evaluation (Krifka to appear).
   It follows that in the standard case concessive clauses necessarily
   involve a richer semantic structure than just a core proposition. This
   has consequences for syntax. Following Krifka, the paper assumes that
   the private act of a judgement is syntactically represented in clausal
   structure by a J(udge)P(hrase). CACs do not contain a JP-projection, but
   PACs do.
   NonICs encode a speech act; in addition to a JP they also contain a
   Com(mitment)P(hrase) and an ActP(hrase). It is demonstrated that while
   concessives realised as PACs may host so-called weak root phenomena,
   concessives realised as NonICs may also host commitment modifiers and
   so-called strong root phenomena. Further distinguishing syntactic
   properties of concessives realised as PACs or as NonICs are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Learning valence-based responses to favorable and unfavorable options
   requires judgments of the relative value of the options, a process
   necessary for species survival. We found, using engineered mice, that
   circuit connectivity and function of the striosome compartment of the
   striatum are critical for this type of learning. Calcium imaging during
   valence-based learning exhibited a selective correlation between
   learning and striosomal but not matrix signals. This striosomal activity
   encoded discrimination learning and was correlated with task engagement,
   which, in turn, could be regulated by chemogenetic excitation and
   inhibition. Striosomal function during discrimination learning was
   disturbed with aging and severely so in a mouse model of Huntington's
   disease. Anatomical and functional connectivity of parvalbumin-positive,
   putative fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) to striatal projection neurons
   was enhanced in striosomes compared with matrix in mice that learned.
   Computational modeling of these findings suggests that FSIs can modulate
   the striosomal signal-to-noise ratio, crucial for discrimination and
   learning.}},

Title = {{Influence of individual biological traits on GPS fix-loss errors in wild
   bird tracking}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{In recent decades, global positioning system (GPS) location data and
   satellite telemetry systems for data transmission have become
   fundamental in the study of basic ecological traits in wildlife biology.
   Evaluating GPS location errors is essential in assessing detailed
   information about the behaviour of an animal species such as migration,
   habitat selection, species distribution or foraging strategy. While many
   studies of the influence of environmental and technical factors on the
   fix errors of solar-powered GPS transmitters have been published, few
   studies have focussed on the performance of GPS systems in relation to a
   species' biological traits. Here, we evaluate the possible effects of
   the biological traits of a large raptor on the frequency of lost
   fixes-the fix-loss rate (FLR). We analysed 95,686 records obtained from
   20 Bearded Vultures Gypaetus barbatus tracked with 17 solar-powered
   satellite transmitters in the Pyrenees (Spain, France and Andorra),
   between 2006 and 2019 to evaluate the influence of biological,
   technical, and environmental factors on the fix-loss rate of
   transmitters. We show that combined effects of technical factors and the
   biological traits of birds explained 23\% of the deviance observed. As
   expected, the transmitter usage time significantly increased errors in
   the fix-loss rate, although the flight activity of birds revealed an
   unexpected trade-off: the greater the proportion of fixes recorded from
   perched birds, the lower the FLR. This finding seems related with the
   fact that territorial and breeding birds spend significantly more time
   flying than non-territorial individuals. The fix success rate is
   apparently due to the interactions between a complex of factors.
   Non-territorial adults and subadults, males, and breeding individuals
   showed a significantly lower FLR than juveniles-immatures females,
   territorial birds or non-breeding individuals. Animal telemetry tracking
   studies should include error analyses before reaching any ecological
   conclusions or hypotheses about spatial distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The main aim of this study was to evaluate if an
   individualized assisted walking program (IAWP) for hospitalized older
   patients could improve walking ability compared with usual geriatric
   care and rehabilitation.
   Design A randomized controlled trial with an active control group, open
   labeled with parallel assignment was conducted between October 2018 and
   January 2020.
   Setting Geriatric ward.
   Participants A total of 387 hospitalized patients (>= 65 years) were
   randomly assigned to an intervention or control (usual-care) group.
   Intervention The control group received usual hospital care. The
   intervention group received also an IAWP.
   Measurements The primary endpoint was change in walking ability from
   hospital admission (considering both current and pre-admission status)
   to discharge, as assessed with the Braden Activity subscale measures.
   The secondary endpoint was the occurrence of in-hospital adverse events,
   such as complications of mobility, pressure ulcers, falls, pain and
   mortality, and the length of hospital stay. Intention-to-treat and
   per-protocol analyses were performed.
   Results Baseline characteristics were similar between intervention and
   control groups. The intervention group, relative to the control group,
   had significantly improved walking ability at discharge (P < .001).
   There were no statistically significant differences between the groups
   in terms of in-hospital adverse events. No adverse effects were
   detected.
   Conclusion In in-hospital patients aged 65 and older, an IAWP improves
   walking ability at discharge.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) values were determined for the six
   ternary mixtures composed of water, valeric acid or caproic acid, and
   esters (cyclohexyl acetate, benzyl acetate, and benzyl benzoate) at
   298.2 K and 101.3 kPa. All of the studied mixtures displayed type-2 LLE
   behavior. The Hand equation was applied in this study to ascertain the
   reliability of the measured tie line data. The NRTL and UNIQUAC models
   were used to regress the measured tie line values, and the binary
   interaction parameters were determined. As a result, influence of the
   structural characteristics of the esters used in this work on the
   biphasic region is small. Extraction capacity of the used solvents was
   achieved using the evaluation of distribution constant (distribution
   coefficient) and selectivity (separation factor) data. In general, the
   esters used in this study have relatively high selectivities and
   appeared to be proper solvents for the extraction of these acids from

   into the two energetically available channels, C(D-1) + O(P-3) and
   C(P-3) + O(P-3), have been obtained for the three CO isotopologues,
   (CO)-C-12-O-16 , (CO)-C-13-O-16, and (CO)-C-12-O-18, in the vacuum
   ultraviolet range 100500-102320 cm(-1). The two vibronic states of
   (1)Sigma(+) symmetry, F(3d sigma) (1)Sigma(+)(nu' = 1) and J(4s sigma)
   (1)Sigma(+)(nu' = 0), predominantly dissociate into the lowest channel
   C(P-3) + O(P-3) through interactions with the repulsive D'(1)Sigma(+)
   state. All three vibronic states of (1)Pi symmetry, E'(1)Pi(nu' = 1, 2)
   and G(3d pi) (1)Pi(nu' = 0), dissociate into both of the channels above.
   The photodissociation branching ratios into the channel C(D-1) + O(P-3)
   for E'(1)Pi(nu' = 1, 2) are found to be independent of both the
   rotational quantum number and elf parity, while those for G(3d pi)
   (1)Pi(nu' = 0) strongly depend on the rotational quantum number,
   indicating very different predissociation pathways between the valence
   states E'(1)Pi(nu' = 1, 2) and the Rydberg state G(3d pi) (1)Pi(nu' =
   0). The potential energy curves of CO in the aforementioned energy range
   and below have recently been well constructed due to a series of
   interplays between high-resolution spectroscopic studies and theoretical
   calculations; the photodissociation branching ratios measured in this
   study can provide further benchmarks for future theoretical
   investigations which aim to understand the detailed predissociation
   dynamics of CO.}},

Title = {{Activities in Daily Living: The development of a new client-centred ADL
   intervention for persons with stroke}},
Journal = {{SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY}},
Abstract = {{Background
   An intervention that contains several interacting components can be
   defined as a complex intervention. This intervention was developed in
   accordance with the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance for complex
   interventions.
   Aim
   To describe the development, theoretical framework, and content of a
   client-centred activities in daily living intervention (CADL) for people
   with stroke.
   Material and methods
   Different steps were used; identifying the evidence base,
   identifying/developing theory and the modelling process and outcomes in
   the development of the CADL. The remodelling of the process and content
   of the intervention that emerged are defined.
   Results
   Findings from a series of qualitative studies of people with stroke
   demonstrated the need to develop an ADL intervention based on the
   clients' lived experiences. The theoretical framework is based on
   empirical research, theories about human occupation and
   client-centredness. The CADL is applying an occupational and
   phenomenological perspective in order to enable agency in daily
   activities and participation in everyday life among persons with stroke.
   Conclusions and significance
   The article can be used as an example of how to present the development
   and theoretical framework of a new complex intervention in occupational
   therapy.}},

Abstract = {{A huge amount of rubber waste coming from tire industry or other sources
   (eg, weather strips producers) has attracted interest from researchers
   to investigate the possibility of recycling used rubber for various
   products, particularly in construction sector. This article presents a
   series of experimental and numerical investigations to evaluate the
   feasibility of regenerated synthetic rubber ethylene propylene diene
   monomer (EPDM) for production of a building seismic isolation system.
   Four rubber blends using two different sources of regenerated EPDM are
   considered in this study. The mechanical properties of the recycled
   rubber under study are evaluated through uniaxial tensile and relaxation
   tests, considering the accelerated aging effect. Based on several
   hyperelasticity and viscosity models of rubber available in the
   literature, several numerical test simulations on rubber compounds and
   on a prototype of fiber reinforced elastomeric isolators (FREIs) are
   performed. The test results reveal that the proposed regenerated EPDM
   compounds can be particularly suitable for the production of unbonded
   FREIs, especially because they are able to exhibit low/moderate tensile
   stresses at high-shear strain. The results also show that not all
   regenerated rubber blends fulfill the durability requirements of rubber
   for seismic isolation after accelerated aging tests. The durability of
   the specimens seems to be mainly affected by the choice of the
   regenerated rubber source.}},

Title = {{Comparison Between Two Pharmacologic Strategies to Alleviate Rewarming
   Shock: Vasodilation vs. Inodilation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Rewarming from hypothermia is often challenged by coexisting cardiac
   dysfunction, depressed organ blood flow (OBF), and increased systemic
   vascular resistance. Previous research shows cardiovascular inotropic
   support and vasodilation during rewarming to elevate cardiac output
   (CO). The present study aims to compare the effects of inodilatation by
   levosimendan (LS) and vasodilation by nitroprusside (SNP) on OBF and
   global oxygen transport during rewarming from hypothermia. We used an in
   vivo experimental rat model of 4 h 15 degrees C hypothermia and
   rewarming. A stable isotope-labeled microsphere technique was used to
   determine OBF. Cardiac and arterial pressures were monitored with
   fluid-filled pressure catheters, and CO was measured by thermodilution.
   Two groups were treated with either LS (n = 7) or SNP (n = 7) during the
   last hour of hypothermia and throughout rewarming. Two groups served as
   hypothermic (n = 7) and normothermic (n = 6) controls. All hypothermia
   groups had significantly reduced CO, oxygen delivery, and OBF after
   rewarming compared to their baseline values. After rewarming, LS had
   elevated CO significantly more than SNP (66.57 +/- 5.6/+30\% vs. 54.48
   +/- 5.2/+14\%) compared to the control group (47.22 +/- 3.9), but their
   ability to cause elevation of brain blood flow (BBF) was the same (0.554
   +/- 0.180/+81 vs. 0.535 +/- 0.208/+75\%) compared to the control group
   (0.305 +/- 0.101). We interpret the vasodilator properties of LS and SNP
   to be the primary source to increase organ blood flow, superior to the
   increase in CO.}},

Title = {{Serum keratin 19 (CYFRA21-1) links ductular reaction with portal
   hypertension and outcome of various advanced liver diseases}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundKeratins (Ks) represent tissue-specific proteins. K18 is
   produced in hepatocytes while K19, the most widely used ductular
   reaction (DR) marker, is found in cholangiocytes and hepatic progenitor
   cells. K18-based serum fragments are commonly used liver disease
   predictors, while K19-based serum fragments detected through CYFRA21-1
   are established tumor but not liver disease markers yet. Since DR
   reflects the severity of the underlying liver disease, we systematically
   evaluated the usefulness of CYFRA21-1 in different liver disease
   severities and etiologies.MethodsHepatic expression of ductular keratins
   (K7/K19/K23) was analyzed in 57 patients with chronic liver disease
   (cohort i). Serum CYFRA21-1 levels were measured in 333 Austrians with
   advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) of various etiologies undergoing
   hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement (cohort ii), 231
   French patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (cohort iii), and 280
   hospitalized Germans with decompensated cirrhosis of various etiologies
   (cohort iv).Results(i) Hepatic K19 levels were comparable among F0-F3
   fibrosis stages, but increased in cirrhosis. Hepatic K19 mRNA strongly
   correlated with the levels of other DR-specific keratins. (ii) In ACLD,
   increased serum CYFRA21-1 associated with the presence of clinically
   significant portal hypertension (CSPH; HVPG >= 10mmHg) (OR=5.87
   {[}2.95-11.68]) and mortality (HR=3.02 {[}1.78-5.13]; median follow-up
   22months). (iii) In alcoholic cirrhosis, elevated serum CYFRA21-1
   indicated increased risk of death/liver transplantation (HR=2.59
   {[}1.64-4.09]) and of HCC (HR=1.74 {[}1.02-2.96]) over the long term
   (median follow-up 73months). (iv) In decompensated cirrhosis, higher
   serum CYFRA21-1 predicted 90-day mortality (HR=2.97 {[}1.92-4.60]) with
   a moderate accuracy (AUROC 0.64), independently from established
   prognostic scores.ConclusionsHepatic K19 mRNA and serum CYFRA21-1 levels
   rise in cirrhosis. Increased CYFRA21-1 levels associate with the
   presence of CSPH and reliably indicate mortality in the short and long
   term independently of conventional liver biochemistry markers or scoring
   systems. Hence, the widely available serum CYFRA21-1 constitutes a
   novel, DR-related marker with prognostic implications in patients with
   different settings of advanced liver disease.}},

Abstract = {{Ecotourism opportunities in the marine environment often rely heavily on
   provisioning to ensure the viewing of cryptic species by the public.
   However, intentional feeding of wildlife can impact numerous aspects of
   an animals' behavior and ecology. Southern stingrays (Hypanus americana)
   provisioned at Stingray City Sandbar (SCS) in Grand Cayman have altered
   diel activity patterns and decreased measures of health. This study
   looked at seasonal changes in stable isotope (SI) and fatty acid (FA)
   profiles of provisioned stingrays at SCS. Plasma delta N-15 was higher
   in male stingrays (11.86 +/- 1.71 parts per thousand) compared to
   females (10.70 +/- 1.71 parts per thousand). Lower values for delta N-15
   in males and females were measured in October during low tourist season,
   suggesting stingrays may be forced to rely on native prey items to
   supplement the decreased amount of provisioned squid available during
   this time. Plasma FA profiles were significantly different between sexes
   and across sampling time points, with FAs 22:6n3, 16:0, 20:5n3, 18:1n3C,
   18:0 and 18:1n9T contributing to dissimilarity scores between groups.
   Dietary FAs primarily contributed to differences between males and
   females lending further evidence to differences in foraging patterns at
   SCS, likely due to intraspecific competition. Further, canonical
   analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) analysis of FA profiles suggest
   similar diets during peak tourist season and differences in diet between
   males and females during the low season. This study demonstrates
   alterations in feeding ecology in stingrays at SCS which is of critical
   importance for effective management of the SCS aggregation.}},

Title = {{The Response of Plant and Soil Properties of Alpine Grassland to
   Long-Term Exclosure in the Northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Currently, grazing exclosure is one of the most important grassland
   management measures for restoring all types of degraded alpine grassland
   in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The most widely distributed
   grassland ecosystems across the northeastern QTP are the alpine meadow
   (AM), alpine meadow steppe (AMS), and alpine steppe (AS). However,
   whether the impacts of fencing on vegetation characteristics and soil
   properties vary among different grassland types remains poorly
   understood despite that numerous individual studies have been conducted.
   This study investigated the vegetation characteristics and soil
   properties in fenced and grazed AM, AMS, and AS in the northeastern QTP.
   Grazing exclosure significantly increased the vegetation coverage and
   Shannon-Wiener diversity index in all the three grasslands. Plant
   species richness was significantly increased in AM, but there were no
   significant changes in AMS and AS. Aboveground biomass was significantly
   increased in AMS and AS but not significant in AM. Increase in the
   percentage of high-quality forage grasses was only observed in AMS.
   Fencing significantly decreased the soil bulk density (BD) and
   significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen at
   a depth of 0-50 cm in AMS and AS but had no effect in AM. Our results
   indicate that the use of fencing for restoring degraded AM might not
   achieve the same expected results as in AS and AMS on the QTP.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral remote sensing has
   shown a tremendous potential normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) for precision agriculture. In this study, data captured from a
   UAV equipped with a Multispectral Mica Sense Red Edge camera used as
   ground-truth information to calibrate Sentinel-2 imagery. UAV-based NDVI
   allowed crop estimation at 10-cm pixel resolution by discriminating
   no-green vegetation pixels. The reflectance value and NDVI of the crops
   at different stages were derived from both UAV and Sentinel-2 images.
   The UAV Multispectral mapping method used in this study provided
   advanced information about the physical conditions of the study area
   (Roorkee) and improved land feature delineation. The result shows that
   UAV data produced more accurate reflectance values than Sentinel-2
   imagery. However, the accuracy of the vegetation index is not wholly
   dependent on the accuracy of the reflectance. The UAV-derived NDVI has
   relatively low sensitivity to the vegetation coverage and
   insignificantly affected by environmental factors compared to NDVI
   derived from Sentinel-2 image.}},

Abstract = {{Medical imaging aids in the analysis of interior parts of the human body
   such as the functioning of the organs or tissues for early treatment of
   diseases. Many different types of medical imaging technologies exist,
   for example, X-ray radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopy,
   positron emission tomography, CT scan (computed tomography), and many
   more. A tumor is an abnormal tissue in the brain which causes damage to
   the functioning of the cell. Therefore, brain tumor detection is an
   incredibly tricky task. Manual detection of a tumor is quite risky as it
   involves the insertion of a needle in the brain. Thus, there is a need
   for automated brain tumor detection systems. The well-timed detection of
   the tumor can add to accurate treatment and can increase the survival
   rate of patients. From machine learning techniques, namely K-nearest
   neighbor, support vector machine, and more to soft computing techniques,
   namely artificial neural network, self-organizing map, and others hold a
   significant stand in detection and categorization of brain tumor.
   Various methods including deep learning-based classifiers such as
   convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, deep belief
   network (DBN), and others are used to make it easier to detect the
   tumor. Hybrid classifiers were also used for classification systems such
   as combining the machine learning approach with soft computing. This
   study is to summarize and compare the work of various authors on
   automatic brain tumor detection using medical imaging. Based on the
   accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity parameters, the results of
   different techniques are analyzed and compared graphically.}},

Title = {{The Role of Yersinia enterocolitica O:3 Lipopolysaccharide in
   Collagen-Induced Arthritis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Yersinia enterocolitica O:3 is mentioned among the most common
   arthritogenic pathogens. Bacterial components (including
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) may persist in the joint after eradication of
   infection. Having an adjuvant activity, LPS may enhance production of
   anticollagen antibodies, involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid
   arthritis. Furthermore, its ability to activate complement contributes
   to the inflammation. The aim of this work was to investigate whether
   Yersinia LPS (coinjected with collagen) is associated with arthritis
   progression or other pathological effects and to elucidate the mechanism
   of this association. It was demonstrated that murine mannose-binding
   lectin C (MBL-C) recognizes the inner core heptoses of the Rd1 chemotype
   LPS of Yersinia. In addition, the Rd1 LPS activates the MBL-associated
   serine protease 1 (MASP-1) stronger than the S and Ra chemotype LPS and
   comparable to Klebsiella pneumoniae O:3 LPS. However, in contrast to the
   latter, Yersinia Rd1 LPS was associated neither with the adjuvancity nor
   with the enhancement of pathological changes in animal paws/impairment
   of motility. On the other hand, it seemed to be more hepatotoxic when
   compared with the other tested endotoxins, while the enlargement of
   inguinal lymph nodes and drop in hepatic MBL-C expression (at the mRNA
   level) were independent of LPS chemotype. Our data did not suggest no
   greater impact Y. enterocolitica O:3 on the development or severity of
   arthropathy related to anticollagen antibody-induced arthritis in mice,
   although its interaction with MBL-C and subsequent complement activation
   may contribute to some adverse effects.}},

Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1854-1870}},

Abstract = {{Crop production in water-limited environments may be enhanced through
   improved soil function by facilitating precipitation capture and erosion
   control. Soil macrofauna are known to support improved soil structure
   and water dynamics through ecosystem engineering activities, and their
   populations can be influenced by management. We examined the effect of
   bare summer fallow frequency on soil macrofauna communities and soil
   physical properties in a long-term (32-yr) dryland no-till agroecosystem
   experiment at two sites in eastern Colorado, USA. Treatments represented
   a gradient of fallow frequency and organic matter inputs, which included
   wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow, wheat-corn (Zea mays L.)-fallow,
   and continuously cropped with no planned summer fallow. The design also
   included a perennial grass treatment with minimal management consisting
   of six native grasses. We observed links between soil macrofauna and
   soil functional metrics, particularly related to soil aggregation and
   water infiltration. There was a trend toward higher macrofauna
   populations and soil function with increased cropping system intensity,
   and perennial grass outperformed the cropped treatments significantly
   for most soil health parameters. Multivariate analyses revealed that
   different treatments support relatively distinct macrofauna communities.
   Our results suggest that soil macrofauna populations may be important
   facilitators of soil structure and associated water dynamics in dryland
   no-till agroecosystems and respond positively to reduced fallow and
   higher organic inputs.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of abatacept (ABA) by
   anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (ACPA) status on disease activity as
   well as radiographic progression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
   (RA) in clinical settings. A retrospective cohort study was conducted
   using data from a multicenter registry. Data from a total of 553
   consecutive RA patients treated with intravenous ABA were included. We
   primarily compared the status of disease activity (SDAI) and
   radiographic progression (van der Heijde modified total Sharp score:
   mTSS) between the ACPA-negative (N=107) and ACPA-positive (N=446)
   groups. `ACPA positive' was defined as >= 13.5 U/mL of anti-CCP
   antibody. Baseline characteristics between groups were similar. The
   proportion of patients who achieved low disease activity (LDA; SDAI <=
   11) at 52 weeks was significantly higher in the ACPA-positive group.
   Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified ACPA positivity as
   an independent predictor for achievement of LDA at 52 weeks. Drug
   retention rate at 52 weeks estimated by the Kaplan-Meier curve was
   significantly higher in the ACPA-positive group. Achievement rate of
   structural remission (Delta mTSS <= 0.5) at 52 weeks was similar between
   groups. ABA treatment demonstrated a significantly higher clinical
   response and higher drug retention rate in ACPA-positive patients.
   Progression of joint destruction was similar between the ACPA-negative
   and ACPA-positive groups. Close attention should be paid to joint
   destruction even in patients showing a favorable response to ABA,
   especially when the ACPA status is positive.}},

Abstract = {{Most of our knowledge related to how social exclusion affects those who
   ostracize and those who are being ostracized is based on questionnaires
   administered after the ostracism situation is over. In this research, we
   strived to further our understanding of the internal dynamics of an
   ostracism situation. We therefore examined individuals'
   language-specifically, function words-as a behavior indicative of
   psychological processes and emergent states that can be unobtrusively
   recorded right in the situation. In online chats, 128 participants
   talked about a personal topic in groups of three. In the experimental
   group (n = 79), two conversation partners ignored every contribution by
   the third. We found that, compared to the control group, these targets
   of ostracism used language indicative of a self-focus and worsened mood,
   but not of social focus or positivity, although positivity was related
   to a writer's likeability. Sources of ostracism used language suggesting
   that they were distancing themselves from the situation, and they
   further engaged in victim derogation. We discuss how our results
   highlight the severity and potential self-sustainability of ostracism.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the emergence and evolution of the discourse on
   mental health problems as an occupational health risk in the
   professional debates among Finnish insurance workers from a historical
   perspective. Our findings indicate that the mental health discourse was
   influenced by organizational, cultural and political changes. We also
   found that the employee's role and the power relations in the insurance
   sector influenced the way in which mental health problems were
   articulated in professional debates. The workplace democratization
   movement of the 1970s and the increasing power of trade unions paved the
   way for the recognition and manifestation of employees' mental
   ill-health and vice versa, the increase of mental health problems
   legitimized the activity of the union. In the 1990s and 2000s, however,
   the individualization trend led to the view that employees themselves
   were responsible for maintaining and regulating their own mental health
   and competitiveness, once again limiting their opportunities to express
   their grievances at the workplace and undermining the solidarity between
   employees.}},

Abstract = {{An on-land frequency domain electromagnetic geophysical survey was
   conducted across a tombolo delimiting the southern bay of Tel Dor
   (northern Israel) to the south. It was accompanied by a marine
   archaeological survey adjacent to its northern edge. Results indicate a
   deep channel connecting the bay and the Tantura Lagoon to the south. At
   its northern exit, an NW-SE trending square anomaly is visible in the
   geophysical data, buried underneath centuries of sand accumulation. It
   is parallel and similar in shape and scale to a Hellenistic feature
   observed in satellite data and excavated during the underwater
   archaeological survey. It seems that during the beginning/Middle Bronze
   Age, a natural or manmade channel was utilized as an entrance to the
   bay. As sea levels rose and sand began to accumulate, the channel was
   periodically filled in and would have needed to have been cleared.
   Eventually, it became too expensive or inconvenient to maintain,
   probably during the Byzantine period. The southern anchorage was
   abandoned for more favorable conditions to the north of the Tel. The
   sequence of events shows how ancient builders first utilized a natural
   channel, maintained it as sea levels rose, and abandoned it when it
   became too problematic to maintain.}},

Title = {{Core-Shell Structured NaYF4:Yb,Er Nanoparticles with Excellent
   Upconversion Luminescent for Targeted Drug Delivery}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLUSTER SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{A core-shell-structured composite by combining mesoporous silica with
   upconversion luminescence (UCL) property had considerable application
   potentials in the fields of drug delivery, disease diagnosis, and
   therapy. In this paper, a monodisperse, core-shell-structured
   NaYF4:Yb,Er@nSiO(2)@mSiO(2) nanoparticle (UCNP@MSNs-FA) with excellent
   UCL property was successfully fabricated by a facile two-step sol-gel
   strategy and by modifying the surface with folic acid (FA) to strengthen
   its tumor-targeting performance. The properties of the composite were
   studied extensively, which indicated that UCNP@MSNs-FA possessed good
   dispersion, typical core-shell-structured with high specific surface
   area (132.775 m(2)/g), and excellent UCL property that improve cell
   imaging and drug delivery. The viability of L929 cells and hemolysis
   assay demonstrated the good biocompatibility of the composite. By using
   doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) as a model drug, the drug loading
   content and encapsulation efficiency of UCNP@MSNs-FA could reach as high
   as 11.2\% and 37.3\%, respectively, which proved the effectiveness to
   load anticancer drugs. In addition, the DOX-UCNP@MSNs-FA system
   exhibited sustained drug release and strong pH-dependent performance, in
   which the drug release would be accelerated at the slightly acidic
   microenvironment in the tumor. Moreover, experimental results indicated
   that DOX-UCNP@MSNs-FA exhibited specific cytotoxicity to KB cells but
   weakened toxicity to FR-negative cells. Therefore, the as-prepared
   UCNP@MSNs-FA could be used potential for simultaneous targeted
   anti-cancer drug delivery and cell imaging and enhance the therapeutic
   efficacy against FR-positive tumor cells.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the limit of available treatments and the emergence of drug
   resistance in the clinic, invasive fungal infections are an intractable
   problem with high morbidity and mortality. The cell wall, as a
   fungi-specific structure, is an appealing target for the discovery and
   development of novel and low-toxic antifungal agents. In an attempt to
   accelerate the discovery of novel cell wall targeted drugs, this
   Perspective will provide a comprehensive review of the progress made to
   date on the development of fungal cell wall inhibitors. Specifically,
   this review will focus on the targets, discovery process, chemical
   structures, antifungal activities, and structure-activity relationships.
   Although two types of cell wall antifungal agents are clinically
   available or in clinical trials, it is still a long way for the other
   cell wall targeted inhibitors to be translated into clinical
   applications. Future efforts should be focused on the identification of
   inhibitors against novel conserved cell wall targets.}},

Abstract = {{Electrolyte properties in general and electrolyte ions in particular
   have been shown to have significant effects on the kinetics of
   electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction at metal electrodes, but these
   effects have not yet been fully understood. We investigate the effects
   of cations at the aqueous electrolyte-Cu(211) interface on adsorbate
   binding energies and the electrolyte structure using density functional
   theory (DFT). Charging the interface via explicit Na+ has systematic
   effects on adsorbate-electrolyte interactions and conformations. We
   describe specific local adsorbate-ion interactions, including direct
   alkali ion-adsorbate coordination and hydrogen bonding via
   ion-coordinated water molecules. The relative importance of these
   specific interactions and purely electrostatic field-adsorbate
   interactions is investigated by comparing the DFT-calculated ion effects
   to those predicted by purely electrostatic models of the interface and
   the adsorbates. We find that the trend in ion effects among different
   adsorbates at constant surface charge density is well explained by a
   purely electrostatic interaction model. The binding energy of OCCHO is
   found to depend strongly on the surface charge density as well as the
   spatial distribution of ions at constant surface charge density. These
   effects are also explained by a purely electrostatic local electrostatic
   field-adsorbate model. This indicates that alkali ion effects can be
   mainly attributed to purely electrostatic field interactions and that
   the local field at ion-stabilized active sites can depend significantly
   on both the overall charge density and on the spatial distribution of
   ions at constant charge density. This work provides new insight on
   alkali ion effects on a variety of adsorbates relevant to the CO2 and CO
   reduction reactions by describing specific local ion-adsorbate
   interactions, systematic changes in adsorbate-electrolyte interactions
   induced by explicit surface charge, and comparisons of the calculated
   effects on binding energies to simple electrostatic field-adsorbate
   models to explain trends among various adsorbates and at varying surface
   charge densities and supercell configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Thorium nitride (ThN), a promising metallic nuclear fuel with higher
   actinide density and higher thermal conductivity, is investigated as a
   candidate nuclear fuel for the next generation of reactors. In this
   article, a systematic investigation of the adsorption mechanism of
   molecular (O-2) and dissociated oxygen (O-O) for several configurations,
   on clean ThN (100), (110), and (111) surfaces, was performed using the
   density functional theory calculations. To elucidate the interfacial
   interaction of ThN with O-2, an extensive examination of the relaxed
   adsorption structures, adsorption energies, electronic structure,
   changes in bond lengths, and the Bader charge transfer were conducted.
   The energetics and the most stable adsorption configurations of O-2 at
   higher coverages are also reported. The results obtained indicate that
   the (100) surface is the most stable with a surface energy of 0.98
   J/m(2), followed by (111) and (110) with an energy of 1.68 J/m(2) and
   1.77 J/m(2) respectively. The relaxed adsorption structures revealed
   that O-2 has a stronger affinity for the thorium (Th) atom than the
   nitrogen (N) atom. The calculated interatomic bond distances of the Th-O
   bond was found to be consistent with the measured bond length of thorium
   oxide (ThO2), indicating the formation of the thorium oxide layer on the
   surface of ThN. Among all the different configurations considered on the
   (100) surface, only the O-2 molecule placed at the Th-N bridge site has
   undergone spontaneous dissociation, whereas, in the case of (111)
   surface, the O-2 molecule placed at the bridge site and the side-on Th
   site has undergone spontaneous dissociation. However, the O-2 molecule
   adsorbed on the (110) surfaces of ThN requires activation energy for
   dissociation to occur. These observations in ThN surfaces are in stark
   contrast with the previously reported cases of uranium nitride (UN) and
   alpha-U (001), where all the configurations have undergone a spontaneous
   dissociation. Oxidation behavior of ThN is a critical issue that needs
   to be understood before researchers can push for its use in commercial
   reactors. In line with this thought, a molecular-level understanding of
   the surface chemistry of ThN in an oxygen environment is expected to
   provide information on the oxidation mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{One critical issue in the design of amine-based sorbents and solvents
   for nextgeneration CO2 capture technology is the effect of H2O on the
   behavior of adsorbed CO2. To gain an insight into the effect of the
   complex interaction between adsorbed CO2/H2O on the amine efficiency and
   binding strength of the adsorbed species, the surface and subsurface
   molecular interactions of H2O, CO2, and H2O + CO2 were studied over
   tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) films by in situ infrared spectroscopy
   (IR), mass spectrometry, and density functional theory (DFT). The TEPA
   films were used because they emulate the immobilized amine on solid
   amine sorbents. The H2O molecules in the TEPA film serve as a proton
   acceptor during the coadsorption of CO2 and H2O, allowing the formation
   of hydronium carbamate and producing a ratio of 1:1 for the CO2/amine
   site. The DFT-simulated structures and IR spectrum enabled the
   assignment of the experimental IR spectrum for hydronium carbamate that
   was produced during the interaction of CO2 on the premixed TEPA/H2O and
   TEPA/D2O films. Adsorption of CO2 on a TEPA/H2O (weight ratio of 5:1)
   film produced strongly adsorbed species: a hydrated hydronium carbamate
   with a binding energy >-130 kJ/mol and a cluster of the water molecule
   with a binding energy >-180 kJ/mol, which endothermically desorbed from
   the TEPA/H2O film at temperature above 90 degrees C. In addition to
   these strongly adsorbed species embedded in the bulk of the TEPA/H2O
   film, weakly adsorbed CO2 + H2O species (desorbed at temperature below
   70 degrees C) on the surface of TEPA film were elucidated to be single
   H2O molecule dispersed on amine sites and water coordinated zwitterion.
   H2O controlled the CO2 capture capacity, the binding energy of adsorbed
   CO2/H2O, and their adsorption/desorption kinetics through the
   intermolecular interactions of CO2 and H2O with the specific spatial
   locations of amine sites. The observation of weakly adsorbed CO2/H2O
   suggests the spatial arrangements of amine sites in the amine sorbents
   and solvents can be used to fine-tune their regeneration temperature.}},

Abstract = {{In eusocial insect colonies, non-reproductive workers often perform
   different tasks. Tasks of an individual worker are shifted depending on
   various factors, e.g., age and colony demography. Although a
   vitellogenin (Vg) gene play regulatory roles in both reproductive and
   non-reproductive division of labours in a honeybee, it has been shown
   that the insect Vg underwent multiple gene duplications and
   sub-functionalisation, especially in apical ant lineages. The regulatory
   roles of duplicated Vgs were suggested to change evolutionarily among
   ants, whereas such roles in phylogenetically basal ants remain unclear.
   Here, we examined the expression patterns of conventional Vg (CVg),
   Vg-like A, Vg-like B and Vg-like C, as well as Vg receptor, during the
   task shift in an age-dependent manner and under experimental
   manipulation of colony demography in a primitive ant Diacamma sp.
   Expressions of CVg and Vg-like A in a brain were associated with a
   nursing task. It is suggested that associations of brain expressions of
   these Vgs with worker tasks were acquired in the basal ant lineage, and
   that such Vg functions could have sub-functionalised in the derived ant
   lineage.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this study is to reduce the number of mutations
   and, consequently, reduce the cost of mutation test. The results of
   related studies indicate that about 40\% of injected faults (mutants) in
   the source code are effect-less (equivalent). Equivalent mutants are one
   of the major costs of mutation testing and the identification of
   equivalent and effect-less mutants has been known as an undecidable
   problem. Design/methodology/approach In a program with n branch
   instructions (if instruction) there are 2n execution paths (test paths)
   that the data and codes into each of these paths can be considered as a
   target of mutation. Given the role and impact of data in a program, some
   of data and codes propagates the injected mutants more likely to the
   output of the program. In this study, firstly the error-propagation rate
   of the program data is quantified using static analysis of the program
   control-flow graph. Then, the most error-propagating test paths are
   identified by the proposed heuristic algorithm (Genetic Algorithm
   {[}GA]). Data and codes with higher error-propagation rate are only
   considered as the strategic locations for the mutation testing. Findings
   In order to evaluate the proposed method, an extensive series of
   mutation testing experiments have been conducted on a set of traditional
   benchmark programs using MuJava tool set. The results depict that the
   proposed method reduces the number of mutants about 24\%. Also, in the
   corresponding experiments, the mutation score is increased about 5.6\%.
   The success rate of the GA in finding the most error-propagating paths
   of the input programs is 99\%. On average, only 7.46\% of generated
   mutants by the proposed method are equivalent. Indeed, 92.54\% of
   generated mutants are non-equivalent. Originality/value The main
   contribution of this study is as follows: Proposing a set of equations
   to measure the error-propagation rate of each data, basic-block and
   execution path of a program. Proposing a genetic algorithm to identify a
   most error-propagating path of program as locations of mutations.
   Developing an efficient mutation-testing framework that mutates only the
   strategic locations of a program identified by the proposed genetic
   algorithms. Reducing the time and cost of mutation testing by reducing
   the equivalent mutants.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we examined prognostic factors for extremely poor visual outcomes
   in patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in actual
   practices. We included 150 consecutive eyes with treatment-naive acute
   CRVO from four different facilities and observed them for over 24
   months. Macular edema (ME) was treated with one or three monthly
   anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections (1 or 3+pro re nata).
   According to the final Snellen visual acuity (VA), we divided the
   patients into very poor VA (<20/200) and control (<greater than or equal
   to>20/200) groups and examined risk factors for poor final visual
   outcomes. The baseline Snellen VA was hand motion to 20/13. The mean
   number of anti-VEGF injections for ME was 5.3 +/- 3.7 during the
   follow-up period. In total, 49 (32.7\%) patients exhibited a very poor
   final VA; this group comprised significantly older patients with a
   significantly poorer baseline VA (P<0.01 for both) than the control
   group. Comorbid internal carotid artery disease and diabetic retinopathy
   were significantly associated with a poor final VA. In actual clinical
   practice, visual outcomes may be extremely poor despite ME treatment in
   certain patients with CRVO, with advanced age, poor baseline VA, and
   comorbid internal carotid artery disease and diabetic retinopathy being
   significant risk factors.}},

Abstract = {{This Perspective of the published essential medicinal chemistry of
   cannabidiol (CBD) provides evidence that the popularization of
   CBD-fortified or CBD-labeled health products and CBD-associated health
   claims lacks a rigorous scientific foundation. CBD's reputation as a
   cure-all puts it in the same class as other ``natural{''} panaceas,
   where valid ethnobotanicals are reduced to single, purportedly active
   ingredients. Such reductionist approaches oversimplify useful,
   chemically complex mixtures in an attempt to rationalize the commercial
   utility of natural compounds and exploit the ``natural{''} label.
   Literature evidence associates CBD with certain semiubiquitous, broadly
   screened, primarily plantbased substances of undocumented purity that
   interfere with bioassays and have a low likelihood of becoming
   therapeutic agents. Widespread health challenges and pandemic crises
   such as SARS-CoV-2 create circumstances under which scientists must be
   particularly vigilant about healing claims that lack solid foundational
   data. Herein, we offer a critical review of the published medicinal
   chemistry properties of CBD, as well as precise definitions of
   CBD-containing substances and products, distilled to reveal the
   essential factors that impact its development as a therapeutic agent.}},

Abstract = {{The association of antimicrobial usage (AMU) with prevalence of
   antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) Staphylococcus aureus, including
   methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in livestock raw milk consumed by
   pastoralists in Kenya remains unclear. We investigated the relationship
   between AMU and emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. aureus,
   including MRSA in raw milk of livestock. AMU data were obtained using
   sales records from veterinary pharmacies. S. aureus was isolated from
   603 milk samples from various livestock species, including sheep, goat,
   cow, and camel reared in Isiolo and Marsabit counties in Kenya.
   Resistant phenotypes and genotypes were determined by disc diffusion and
   molecular methods, respectively. Correlation between AMU and occurrence
   of resistance was determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient (r)
   method. The consumption of various antimicrobial classes were as
   follows; 4,168 kg of oxytetracycline, 70 kg of sulfonamides, 49.7 kg of
   aminoglycosides, 46 kg of beta-lactams, 39.4 kg of macrolides, and 0.52
   kg for trimethoprim. The S. aureus isolates were mainly resistant to
   tetracycline (79\%), ampicillin (58\%), and oxacillin (33\%),
   respectively. A few isolates (5-18\%) were resistant to clindamycin,
   cephalexin, erythromycin, kanamycin, and ciprofloxacin. Most of the
   MDR-S. aureus isolates were MRSA (94\%). The genetic determinants found
   in the AMR isolates included tetK/tetM (96.5\%/19\%) for tetracycline,
   blaZ (79\%) for penicillin, aac (6 `)/aph (2 `')/aph (3 `)-IIIa (53\%)
   for aminoglycosides, mecA (41\%) for oxacillin, and msrA/ermA (24\%/7\%)
   for macrolides. Oxytetracycline usage was correlated to tetK/tetM (r =
   0.62/1) detection, penicillins to mecA/blaZ (r = 0.86/0.98),
   aminoglycoside to aac (6 `)/aph (2 `')/aph (3 `)-IIIa (r = 0.76/-13),
   and macrolide usages for detection of ermA/msrA (r = 0.94/0.77). AMU
   appeared to be associated with occurrence of MDR-SA and the tetM
   detection. Consumption of raw milk contaminated with MRSA could pose a
   serious public health risk in pastoral communities in northern Kenya.}},

Title = {{A mathematical model and inference method for bacterial colonization in
   hospital units applied to active surveillance data for
   carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in an increase in
   antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms. Although not all bacterial
   contact results in infection, patients can become asymptomatically
   colonized, increasing the risk of infection and pathogen transmission.
   Consequently, many institutions have begun active surveillance, but in
   non-research settings, the resulting data are often incomplete and may
   include non-random testing, making conventional epidemiological analysis
   problematic. We describe a mathematical model and inference method for
   in-hospital bacterial colonization and transmission of
   carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae that is tailored for analysis of
   active surveillance data with incomplete observations. The model and
   inference method make use of the full detailed state of the hospital
   unit, which takes into account the colonization status of each
   individual in the unit and not only the number of colonized patients at
   any given time. The inference method computes the exact likelihood of
   all possible histories consistent with partial observations (despite the
   exponential increase in possible states that can make likelihood
   calculation intractable for large hospital units), includes techniques
   to improve computational efficiency, is tested by computer simulation,
   and is applied to active surveillance data from a 13-bed rehabilitation
   unit in New York City. The inference method for exact likelihood
   calculation is applicable to other Markov models incorporating
   incomplete observations. The parameters that we identify are the
   patient-patient transmission rate, pre-existing colonization
   probability, and prior-to-new-patient transmission probability. Besides
   identifying the parameters, we predict the effects on the total
   prevalence (0.07 of the total colonized patient-days) of changing the
   parameters and estimate the increase in total prevalence attributable to
   patient-patient transmission (0.02) above the baseline pre-existing
   colonization (0.05). Simulations with a colonized versus uncolonized
   long-stay patient had 44\% higher total prevalence, suggesting that the
   long-stay patient may have been a reservoir of transmission.
   High-priority interventions may include isolation of incoming colonized
   patients and repeated screening of long-stay patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background The integration of machine learning algorithms in decision
   support tools for physicians is gaining popularity. These tools can
   tackle the disparities in healthcare access as the technology can be
   implemented on smartphones. We present the first, large-scale study on
   patients with skin of colour, in which the feasibility of a novel mobile
   health application (mHealth app) was investigated in actual clinical
   workflows.
   Objective To develop a mHealth app to diagnose 40 common skin diseases
   and test it in clinical settings.
   Methods A convolutional neural network-based algorithm was trained with
   clinical images of 40 skin diseases. A smartphone app was generated and
   validated on 5014 patients, attending rural and urban outpatient
   dermatology departments in India. The results of this mHealth app were
   compared against the dermatologists' diagnoses.
   Results The machine-learning model, in an in silico validation study,
   demonstrated an overall top-1 accuracy of 76.93 +/- 0.88\% and mean
   area-under-curve of 0.95 +/- 0.02 on a set of clinical images. In the
   clinical study, on patients with skin of colour, the app achieved an
   overall top-1 accuracy of 75.07\% (95\% CI = 73.75-76.36), top-3
   accuracy of 89.62\% (95\% CI = 88.67-90.52) and mean area-under-curve of
   0.90 +/- 0.07.
   Conclusion This study underscores the utility of artificial
   intelligence-driven smartphone applications as a point-of-care, clinical
   decision support tool for dermatological diagnosis for a wide spectrum
   of skin diseases in patients of the skin of colour.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundTo identify and to assess factors enhancing or hindering the
   delivery of breast and cervical cancer screening services in Malawi with
   regard to accessibility, uptake, acceptability and
   effectiveness.MethodsSystematic review of published scientific evidence.
   A search of six bibliographic databases and grey literature was executed
   to identify relevant studies conducted in Malawi in the English
   language, with no time or study design restrictions. Data extraction was
   conducted in Excel and evidence synthesis followed a thematic analysis
   approach to identify and compare emerging themes.ResultsOne hundred and
   one unique records were retrieved and 6 studies were selected for final
   inclusion in the review. Multiple factors affect breast and cervical
   cancer service delivery in Malawi, operating at three interlinked
   levels. At the patient level, lack of knowledge and awareness of the
   disease, location, poor screening environment and perceived quality of
   care may act as deterrent to participation in screening; at the health
   facility level, services are affected by the availability of resources
   and delivery modalities; and at the healthcare system level, inadequate
   funding and staffing (distribution, supervision, retention), and lack of
   appropriate monitoring and guidelines may have a negative impact on
   services. Convenience of screening, in terms of accessibility (location,
   opening times) and integration with other health services (e.g.
   reproductive or HIV services), was found to have a positive effect on
   service uptake. Building awareness of cancer and related services, and
   offering quality screening (dedicated room, privacy, staff
   professionalism etc.) are significant determinants of patient
   satisfaction.ConclusionsCapitalising on these lessons is essential to
   strengthen breast and cervical cancer service delivery in Malawi, to
   increase early detection and to improve survival of women affected by
   the disease.}},

Abstract = {{This article interrogates the ``anomalous{''} case of Black-founded
   towns, so-called because of their relative absence from discourse on
   Black place, their unique struggles for self-determined development, and
   their externally ascribed narratives of absent or dysfunctional
   governance, frequently invoked to explain their lack of access to basic
   infrastructure. We propose illuminating some of these so-called
   anomalies through Charles Mills' ``racial contract,{''} which we argue
   structures space at a deeper level than traditional legal arrangements
   and allows us to look relationally at Black towns in ``white space.{''}
   We also rely on Cedric Robinson's ``racial capitalism{''} to demonstrate
   how white space develops through extraction of value from places
   racialized as nonwhite. Through the case of Tamina, Texas, we argue that
   Black towns specifically, and Black places more generally, experience
   racially predatory governance and resource extraction, often by nearby
   white places, under the guise of following mundane rules of legal
   jurisdiction, standard economic planning, and development. To illustrate
   this, we focus on three overlapping mechanisms of ``creative
   extraction{''} that reinforce white spatial, political, and economic
   power at the expense of Black places: theft, erosion, and exclusion.
   These mechanisms are tied to the environmental harms inflicted on Black
   towns, as some of the existential threats they face.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Boron-lined gas detectors are prospective alternatives to
   helium-3-based neutron detectors. For boron-lined multi-wire
   proportional chamber (MWPC) with neutron grazing incident angle
   geometry, high neutron detection efficiency and 3D position sensitive
   can be realized. In this paper, a multi-layer boron-lined MWPC was
   studied. Methods Influences of the boron coating thickness, coating
   layer numbers and neutron incident angle on the neutron detection
   efficiency were studied and optimized with Geant4 simulation. The output
   signal properties including induced signal width on the readout plane,
   the time resolution and gas gain uniformity of the detector were studied
   with Garfield program. Results and conclusion The results show that the
   neutron detection efficiency can be significantly increased by using
   neutron grazing incident geometry. For 4 layers of (B4C)-B-10 with
   thickness of 1 mu m, the neutron detection efficiency can reach to
   54.56\%, 49.17\% and 44.36\% when neutron incident angle is 6 degrees, 8
   degrees and 10 degrees, respectively. For detector with curved geometry,
   the gas gain is nonuniform among the anode wires, and using separate
   high voltage for each anode wire or wires group can effectively reduce
   the nonuniform of the gas gain. The results of this work can be used to
   optimize the detector design.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Containment measures implemented by some countries to suppress the
   spread of COVID-19 have resulted in a slowdown of the epidemic
   characterized by time series of daily infections plateauing over
   extended periods of time. We prove that such a dynamical pattern is
   compatible with critical susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) dynamics. In
   traditional analyses of the critical SIR model, the critical dynamical
   regime is started from a single infected node. The application of
   containment measures to an ongoing epidemic, however, has the effect to
   make the system enter in its critical regime with a number of infected
   individuals potentially large. We describe how such nontrivial starting
   conditions affect the critical behavior of the SIR model. We perform a
   theoretical and large-scale numerical investigation of the model. We
   show that the expected outbreak size is an increasing function of the
   initial number of infected individuals, while the expected duration of
   the outbreak is a nonmonotonic function of the initial number of
   infected individuals. Also, we precisely characterize the magnitude of
   the fluctuations associated with the size and duration of the outbreak
   in critical SIR dynamics with nontrivial initial conditions. Far from
   herd immunity, fluctuations are much larger than average values, thus
   indicating that predictions of plateauing time series may be
   particularly challenging.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural soils and open fields from Western Uttar Pradesh (India)
   were surveyed to determine the presence of entomopathogenic nematodes.
   From the entomopathogenic nematodes isolated, Heterorhabditis isolates
   were selected and further characterized using morphological,
   morphometrical and molecular approaches. The results showed that three
   isolated nematodes were Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and were
   associated with Photorhabdus laumondii subsp. clarkei bacteria, while
   the rests were identified as Heterorhabditis indica. The biocontrol
   potential of H. bacteriophora against three agricultural pests was
   evaluated. Nematode infectivity experiments showed that the nematode
   isolates DH7 and DH8 were highly pathogenic against cotton bollworm
   (Helicoverpa armigera) and tobacco cutworm (Spodoptera litura), and less
   pathogenic against white grub (Holotrichia serrata) larvae. This study
   sets the basis for establishing new biocontrol agents to be used in pest
   management programs in India.}},

Abstract = {{Some marine plankton called dinoflagellates emit light in response to
   the movement of surrounding water, resulting in a phenomenon called
   milky seas or sea sparkle. The underlying concept, a shear-stress
   induced permeabilisation of biocatalytic reaction compartments, is
   transferred to polymer-based nanoreactors. Amphiphilic block copolymers
   that carry nucleobases in their hydrophobic block are self-assembled
   into polymersomes. The membrane of the vesicles can be transiently
   switched between an impermeable and a semipermeable state by shear
   forces occurring in flow or during turbulent mixing of polymersome
   dispersions. Nucleobase pairs in the hydrophobic leaflet separate when
   mechanical force is applied, exposing their hydrogen bonding motifs and
   therefore making the membrane less hydrophobic and more permeable for
   water soluble compounds. This polarity switch is used to release payload
   of the polymersomes on demand, and to activate biocatalytic reactions in
   the interior of the polymersomes.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To investigate 24-month results of intravitreal aflibercept
   (IVA) for macular edema due to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO-ME).
   Study design Retrospective study. Methods Subjects were treatment-naive
   BRVO-ME patients at the Ophthalmology Department of Juntendo University
   Urayasu Hospital from November 2015 to March 2017 who received IVA
   treatment for 24 months. After the first injection, reinjection was
   performed as needed when ME had recurred or was prolonged beyond 300 mu
   m. Data included changes in best corrected visual acuity and central
   foveal thickness, total number of injections, and the case background
   factors that required reinjection after 12 months. ME remission was
   defined as patients without additional injections for 6 months. Results
   Forty eyes of 40 patients (64.5 +/- 11.5 years), 21 men and 19 women,
   were included. Average best corrected visual acuity and central foveal
   thickness at baseline were logMAR 0.42 +/- 0.21, 601.4 +/- 181.3 mu m,
   logMAR 0.08 +/- 0.25, 214.6 +/- 62.7 mu m at 12 months, logMAR 0.02 +/-
   0.16, 216.6 +/- 97.8 mu m at 24 months, all significantly improved from
   baseline. The average number of injections was 2.2 +/- 1.0 times in the
   first year and 0.4 +/- 0.8 times in the second year. The rate of ME
   remission was 60.0\% at 12 months and 87.5\% at 24 months. Period
   between onset and injections was significantly associated with
   reinjection after 12 months (p =.030). Conclusions IVA was effective
   over 24 months for ME due to BRVO in many cases. Early injection
   treatment may reduce the need for later injections.}},

Abstract = {{As anomalous heat waves are causing the widespread decline of coral
   reefs worldwide, there is an urgent need to identify coral populations
   tolerant to thermal stress. Heat stress adaptive potential is the degree
   of tolerance expected from evolutionary processes and, for a given reef,
   depends on the arrival of propagules from reefs exposed to recurrent
   thermal stress. For this reason, assessing spatial patterns of thermal
   adaptation and reef connectivity is of paramount importance to inform
   conservation strategies. In this work, we applied a seascape genomics
   framework to characterize the spatial patterns of thermal adaptation and
   connectivity for coral reefs of New Caledonia (Southern Pacific). In
   this approach, remote sensing of seascape conditions was combined with
   genomic data from three coral species. For every reef of the region, we
   computed a probability of heat stress adaptation, and two indices
   forecasting inbound and outbound connectivity. We then compared our
   indicators to field survey data, and observed that decrease of coral
   cover after heat stress was lower at reefs predicted with high
   probability of adaptation and inbound connectivity. Last, we discussed
   how these indicators can be used to inform local conservation strategies
   and preserve the adaptive potential of New Caledonian reefs.}},

   against Subacute Thyroiditis Based on Network Pharmacology}},
Journal = {{EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Prunella vulgaris (PV) has a long history of application in traditional
   Chinese and Western medicine as a remedy for the treatment of subacute
   thyroiditis (SAT). This study applied network pharmacology to elucidate
   the mechanism of the effects of PV against SAT. Components of the
   potential therapeutic targets of PV and SAT-related targets were
   retrieved from databases. To construct a protein-protein interaction
   (PPI) network, the intersection of SAT-related targets and PV-related
   targets was input into the STRING platform. Gene ontology (GO) analysis
   and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were carried out using the DAVID
   database. Networks were constructed by Cytoscape for visualization. The
   results showed that a total of 11 compounds were identified according to
   the pharmacokinetic parameters of ADME. A total of 126 PV-related
   targets and 2207 SAT-related targets were collected, and 83 overlapping
   targets were subsequently obtained. The results of the KEGG pathway and
   compound-target-pathway (C-T-P) network analysis suggested that the
   anti-SAT effect of PV mainly occurs through quercetin, luteolin,
   kaempferol, and beta-sitosterol and is most closely associated with
   their regulation of inflammation and apoptosis by targeting the PIK3CG,
   MAPK1, MAPK14, TNF, and PTGS2 proteins and the PI3K-Akt and TNF
   signaling pathways. The study demonstrated that quercetin, luteolin,
   kaempferol, and beta-sitosterol in PV may play a major role in the
   treatment of SAT, which was associated with the regulation of
   inflammation and apoptosis, by targeting the PI3K-Akt and TNF signaling
   pathways.}},

Title = {{When Failure is the Only Option: How Communicative Framing Resources
   Organizational Innovation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS COMMUNICATION}},
Abstract = {{Innovation is valuable for organizational success, yet it presents
   contradictions for workers who must choose between pursuing novel
   courses of action or practicing established strategy. One challenge is
   that many efforts at innovation are not successful, making workers
   reluctant to pursue novel projects. In this study, we seek to answer the
   question: How do individuals responsible for facilitating innovation in
   organizations communicatively construct and frame failure? Abductive
   analysis of interviews with 36 professionals in innovation-related roles
   reveal that these workers communicate in a way that frames the idea of
   failure in a way that bolsters innovation efforts. This framing is
   enacted through a variety of language tools, a mindset aligned with the
   frame, and the development of organizational strategy that
   communicatively supports this framing. The article argues that
   innovation failure is resourced via communicative framing as an asset
   that aids organizational learning. Overall, findings indicate that
   communication plays a central role in constituting innovation practices
   and facilitating change in organizations.}},

Title = {{Association of Retinal Vascular Occlusion With Women Filling a
   Prescription for Female Hormone Therapy}},
Journal = {{JAMA OPHTHALMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{42-48}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Importance Oral contraceptives have been associated with cardiovascular
   disease, ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolic disease, and breast
   cancer. Retinal vascular occlusions share the same risk factors as
   cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Objective To determine
   whether filling a prescription of female hormone therapy (FHT) is
   associated with an increased risk of retinal artery occlusion (RAO) or
   retinal vein occlusions (RVO). Design, Setting, and Participants A
   multiple-cohort study was conducted using an administrative claims
   insurance database comparing women who filled a prescription for FHT
   with matched control individuals. Exclusion occurred for those enrolled
   for less than 2 years in the plan, with no prior ophthalmologic
   examination, with a history of a RAO/RVO, with systemic
   diseases/medications that affected estrogen levels, or a disease
   associated with an increased risk for thromboembolism. Main Outcomes and
   Measures The primary outcome was the incidence of a new diagnosis of RAO
   or RVO. Cox proportional hazard regression modeling with inverse
   probability of treatment weight was used to assess the hazard ratio (HR)
   for a new diagnosis of RAO or RVO relative to filling prescription for
   FHT. Subanalyses were conducted to stratify by age, race/ethnicity,
   diabetes, and hypertension. Results A total of 205304 women who filled a
   prescription for FHT were matched to 755462 control individuals. After
   inverse probability of treatment weight, the study cohort was a mean age
   of 47.2 years, 71\% were White, 7\% were Black, 6\% were Hispanic, 3\%
   were Asian, and 3\% were unknown. There were 41 cases (0.01\%) of RAO
   and 68 cases of RVO (0.02\%) in the FHT cohort. In comparison, there
   were 373 cases of RAO (0.05\%) and 617 cases of RVO (0.08\%) in the
   control cohort. After inverse probability of treatment weight, Cox
   regression analysis showed no difference in hazard for RAO, RVO, or
   combined outcomes in the FHT cohort relative to the control cohort (RAO
   HR, 1.17; 95\% CI, 0.83-1.65; P = .36; RVO HR, 1.07; 95\% CI, 0.82-1.39;
   P = .65; combined HR, 1.10; 95\% CI, 0.89-1.36; P = .37). Subanalyses
   that stratified by age, diabetes, and hypertension similarly showed no
   significant associations between the FHT prescription cohort and all
   outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that filling
   a prescription for FHT, and presumably taking FHT, does not increase the
   risk of RAO or RVO. Such history may not be relevant in the evaluation
   of an individual with an RAO or RVO nor do our results support stopping
   FHT in an individual who develops an RAO or RVO.
   This study investigates whether filling a prescription of female hormone
   therapy (FHT) is associated with an increased risk of retinal artery
   occlusion (RAO) or retinal vein occlusions (RVO).
   Question Is there an increased risk of retinal artery occlusion (RAO) or
   retinal vein occlusion (RVO) with women filling a prescription for
   female hormone therapy (FHT)? Findings In this cohort study of more than
   205000 women who filled a prescription for FHT, there was no evidence to
   suggest an increased risk of RAO or RVO. Meaning These findings suggest
   that filling a prescription for FHT, and presumably taking FHT, does not
   increase the risk of RAO or RVO; such history may not be relevant in the
   evaluation of an individual with an RAO or RVO.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is associated with left
   ventricular (LV) dysfunction in neonates and adults. Cardiac structure
   and function in fetal CoA and cardiac adaptation to early neonatal life
   have not been described. We aimed to investigate the presence of
   cardiovascular structural remodeling and dysfunction in fetuses with CoA
   and their early postnatal cardiac adaptation.
   Methods This was a prospective observational case-control study,
   conducted between 2011 and 2018 in a single tertiary referral center, of
   fetuses with CoA and gestational age-matched normal controls. All
   fetuses/neonates underwent comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation in
   the third trimester of pregnancy and after birth. Additionally,
   myocardial microstructure was assessed in one fetal and one neonatal
   CoA-affected heart specimen, using synchrotron radiation-based X-ray
   phase-contrast microcomputed tomography and histology, respectively.
   Results We included 30 fetuses with CoA and 60 gestational age-matched
   controls. Of these, 20 CoA neonates and 44 controls were also evaluated
   postnatally. Fetuses with CoA showed significant left-to-right volume
   redistribution, with right ventricular (RV) size and output dominance
   and significant geometry alterations with an abnormally elongated LV,
   compared with controls (LV midventricular sphericity index (median
   (interquartile range; IQR), 2.4 (2.0-2.7) vs 1.8 (1.7-2.0); P < 0.001).
   Biventricular function was preserved and no ventricular hypertrophy was
   observed. Synchrotron tomography and histological assessment revealed
   normal myocyte organization in the fetal and neonatal specimens,
   respectively. Postnatally, the LV in CoA cases showed prompt remodeling,
   becoming more globular (LV midventricular sphericity index (mean +/-
   SD), 1.5 +/- 0.3 in CoA vs 1.8 +/- 0.2 in controls; P < 0.001) with
   preserved systolic and normalized output, but altered diastolic,
   parameters compared with controls (LV inflow peak velocity in early
   diastole (mean +/- SD), 97.8 +/- 14.5 vs 56.5 +/- 12.9 cm/s; LV inflow
   peak velocity in atrial contraction (median (IQR), 70.5 (60.1-84.9) vs
   47.0 (43.0-55.0) cm/s; LV peak myocardial velocity in atrial contraction
   (mean +/- SD), 5.1 +/- 2.6 vs 6.3 +/- 2.2 cm/s; P < 0.05). The neonatal
   RV showed increased longitudinal function in the presence of a patent
   arterial duct.
   Conclusions Our results suggest unique fetal cardiac remodeling in CoA,
   in which the LV stays smaller from the decreased growth stimulus of
   reduced volume load. Postnatally, the LV is acutely volume-loaded,
   resulting in an overall geometry change with higher filling velocities
   and preserved systolic function. These findings improve our
   understanding of the evolution of CoA from fetal to neonatal life.

Abstract = {{The dorsal wings of male Sasakia charonda butterflies display a striking
   blue iridescent coloration, which is accentuated by white, orange-yellow
   and red spots, as well as by brown margins. The ventral wings also have
   a variegated, but more subdued, pattern. We investigated the optical
   basis of the various colors of intact wings as well as isolated wing
   scales by applying light and electron microscopy, imaging scatterometry
   and (micro)spectrophotometry. The prominent blue iridescence is due to
   scales with tightly packed, multilayered ridges that contain melanin
   pigment. The scales in the brown wing margins also contain melanin.
   Pigments extracted from the orange-yellow and red spots indicate the
   presence of 3-OH-kynurenine and ommochrome pigment. The scales in the
   white spots also have multilayered ridges but lack pigment. The lower
   lamina of the scales plays a so-far undervalued but often crucial role.
   Its thin-film properties color the majority of the ventral wing scales,
   which are unpigmented and have large windows. The lower lamina acting as
   a thin-film reflector generally contributes to the reflectance of the
   various scale types.}},

Title = {{Olive fruit debittering significantly alters its antioxidant activity as
   evaluated with multiple free-radical scavenging ability}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD MEASUREMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION}},
Abstract = {{Raw olive fruits taste bitter and are not edible without debittering.
   Common debittering process promotes the loss of olive antioxidant
   activity and the magnitude of loss depends on the debittering reagent
   used. Antioxidant activity was evaluated as the scavenging ability that
   was determined with multiple free-radical scavenging (MULTIS) method,
   where the scavenging abilities against five reactive oxygen species
   (HOGreek ano teleia, O(2)(-)Greek ano teleia, ROGreek ano teleia,
   t-BuOOGreek ano teleia, and O-1(2)) were determined. Significant change
   in the scavenging activity of debittered olive was found in four
   debittering methods, i.e., sodium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate,
   ethanol, and sodium chloride treatments. Results indicated that the
   scavenging activities lowered by 60-90\% after most debittering
   processes. Sodium chloride treatment least affected the scavenging
   activity. Based on the MULTIS measurements for the antioxidant
   components and debittering reagents, the rate constants of antioxidant
   compounds with four ROS were determined and the antioxidant activity
   that depends on the method of debittering is discussed. Oleuropein,
   olive-related antioxidant compound, showed high scavenging abilities
   against HOGreek ano teleia (k = 6.70 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1)), ROGreek ano
   teleia (k = 4.69 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1)), and O-1(2) (k = 1.74 x 10(7) M-1
   s(-1)). This study suggests that functionality and taste do not always
   come together. MULTIS method is useful in comparative antioxidant
   capacity studies in foods.}},

Abstract = {{Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has emerged as a first-line treatment for the
   relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) subtype. It is
   hypothesized that DMF has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects
   although mechanisms are not fully understood. This study used RNA-seq to
   profile gene expression responses to DMF in cultured astrocytes.
   Responses were compared with those of isosorbide di-(methyl fumarate)
   (IDMF), a newly designed fumarate that may partially replicate DMF
   activity with fewer adverse effects. Both compounds altered the
   expression of MS-associated genes, including those near MS
   susceptibility loci and genes dysregulated in MS patient astrocytes. The
   shared DMF/IDMF transcriptome response involved altered expression of
   antioxidant genes (e.g., HMOX1) and genes linked to extracellular matrix
   integrity (TIMP3, MMP9) and migration of pro-inflammatory cells into CNS
   (CCL2). IDMF-specific transcriptome responses included down-regulation
   of mitotic genes associated with a proliferative reactive astrocyte
   phenotype (ICAM1) and repression of genes encoding NF-kappaB subunits
   (NFKB2, RELA, RELB) and NF-kappaB targets (NCAPG, CXCL1, OAS3). Overall,
   these results identify astrocyte-centered mechanisms that may contribute
   to the established efficacy of DMF as an RRMS treatment. Furthermore,
   our findings support a rationale for further studies of IDMF as a novel
   fumarate, which may have unique suppressive effects on astrocyte
   reactivity and glial scar formation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{A reliable method for molecular structure determination, excluding
   single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), has been applied to six methyl
   glycoside tetrabenzoates. The proposed method is based on a global
   conformational search using molecular mechanics and subsequent DFT
   calculations guided by a solid-state NMR experiment. The accuracy of the
   applied method has been verified on three methyl glycoside benzoates for
   which the SCXRD analysis has been completed. It appeared that the
   calculated conformations of unprivileged energy could be found in the
   solid state. Bulky substituents (benzoates) exerted less energetically
   favored interactions in crystals in contrast to isolated molecules.
   Therefore, solid-state NMR was revealed to be an indispensable approach
   for choosing credible conformations from the calculated conformations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of Review RNA analysis is beginning to be integrated into
   clinical laboratory genomics, and a review of its current uses and
   limitations is warranted. Here, we summarize the scope and utility of
   RNA analysis in the context of clinical genetic testing, including
   considerations for genetic counseling. Recent Findings RNA analysis is a
   powerful approach for interpreting some variants of uncertain
   significance, for analyzing splicing alterations, for providing
   additional functional evidence for sequence and structural variants, and
   for discovering novel variants. However, a review of RNA sequencing
   methods has noted variability in both laboratory processes and findings.
   Genetic counseling related to RNA analysis has to take into account
   nonstandardized laboratory processes, sample-type limitations, and
   differences in variant-interpretation outcomes. RNA analysis is an
   important complement to DNA testing, although limitations still exist.
   Maximizing the utility of RNA analysis will require appropriate patient
   referrals and standardization of laboratory processes as the practice
   continues to expand the ability to identify and resolve molecular
   diagnoses.}},

Abstract = {{Biocatalytic alkylations are important reactions to obtain chemo-,
   regio- and stereoselectively alkylated compounds. This can be achieved
   using S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases and SAM
   analogs. It was recently shown that a halide methyltransferase (HMT)
   from Chloracidobacterium thermophilum can synthesize SAM from SAH and
   methyl iodide. We developed an iodide-based assay for the directed
   evolution of an HMT from Arabidopsis thaliana and used it to identify a
   V140T variant that can also accept ethyl-, propyl-, and allyl iodide to
   produce the corresponding SAM analogs (90, 50, and 70 \% conversion of
   15 mg SAH). The V140T AtHMT was used in one-pot cascades with
   O-methyltransferases (IeOMT or COMT) to achieve the regioselective
   ethylation of luteolin and allylation of 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde.
   While a cascade for the propylation of 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde gave
   low conversion, the propyl-SAH intermediate could be confirmed by NMR
   spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{The adverse effect of tetracycline antibiotics on microbial activity is
   one of the serious risks for the biologic wastewater treatment process.
   The microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a promising technology for
   wastewater treatment and renewable power generation process. For this
   reason, the investigation of the inhibition effect of the tetracyclines
   on the MFCs is essential for reducing damage on the environment. This
   paper focused on the performance of MFCs under different antibiotic
   concentrations at the range of 0.25-50 mg/L. The power generation
   performance, microbial community and biofilm characteristics
   (morphology, resistance and viability) of MFCs were investigated in
   detail. The results indicated that the increase in the antibiotic
   concentration significantly affected the MFC performance and microbial
   community. A modified non-competitive inhibition model was used to
   predict the inhibition effect of tetracycline antibiotics on the MFCs.

   after hip fracture}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOTHERAPY RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background and purpose: Due to global ageing, more people will suffer
   from hip fracture in the future, and many will be left with permanent
   physical impairments. The care burden for people post hip fracture is
   high. The aim of this study is to measure longitudinal changes in
   physical activity levels and fear of falling in people after hip
   fracture who return home after inpatient rehabilitation.
   Methods: Longitudinal observational study. Participants were recruited
   from three rehabilitation centres in Victoria, Australia. Self-reported
   fear of falling (Short Falls Efficacy Scale - International) and
   physical activity levels (Human Activity Profile - Adjusted Activity
   Score and Frenchay Activity Index) were assessed at 2 weeks, 3 and 6
   months after discharge. Mobility (walking speed) and balance (Timed
   Up-and-Go test and Step Test) were measured at discharge from
   rehabilitation.
   Results: Thirty-four participants (mean age: 82 years {[}SD 8]; 62\%
   female) with unilateral hip fracture were recruited. Participants had
   moderately impaired balance and mobility at discharge compared to
   age-matched normative data; they were all discharged with a walking aid
   and were 40\% slower in their walking speed. Participants had increased
   fear of falling and reduced physical activity 2 weeks after discharge,
   which improved significantly (p < 0.01) over the following 6 months, but
   scores were still lower than the normative values. At 6 months,
   participants also had moderate to high levels of fear of falling and
   were less active than the general population of similar age.
   Discussion: Although fear of falling and physical activity improved in
   the 6 months following discharge, both remained negatively affected
   compared to normative data. Rehabilitation post hip fracture should
   include routine assessment of fear of falling as a potential barrier for
   return of physical activities.}},

Abstract = {{The main tasks of studying molybdenum silicides for use at elevated
   temperature include development of materials with a melting point T-me
   >= 2000 degrees C, possibly with a low brittle-ductile transition
   temperature and resistance to high temperature oxidation. The
   possibility is considered of increasing corrosion resistance of a model
   alloy consisting of molybdenum solid solution and Mo3Si. The effect of
   Sc or Nd alloying additives, as well as preliminary high-temperature
   annealing. i.e., pre-oxidation in order to create a protective oxide
   layer on the alloy surface of a model alloy, is evaluated.
   Non-isothermal oxidation of alloys is performed using combined
   thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis methods. The phase
   composition of the scale formed is determined by an X-ray diffraction
   method. As a result of these studies it is established that preliminary
   oxidation firing of Mo-Mo3Si-REE (about 3 at.\%) alloys at 1100 degrees
   C for 5-10 min provides conditions for forming a layer of SiO2 and REE
   molybdates Sc-2(MoO4)(3) and Nd2Si2O7 at the alloy surface. Oxidation in
   a dynamic regime for treated alloys in the range 500-850 degrees C
   proceeds much more slowly than for the initial samples. This can be
   explained by the difficult access of oxygen to the reaction zone through
   a protective layer of non-volatile oxides. In addition, preliminary
   oxidation of Mo-Mo3Si alloyed with Sc or Nd during subsequent oxidation
   leads to an increase in the transition temperature for the process from
   the stage of oxide formation to intense MoO3 sublimation.}},

Title = {{Interesting Scenarios during Radiofrequency Ablation of Varicose Veins
   at University Hospital of Nepal}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VASCULAR MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{A varicose vein is a common venous condition which affects the great
   saphenous vein and small saphenous vein causing symptoms of pain, edema,
   itchiness, pigmentation, and ulceration. There are various modalities of
   the treatment of varicose veins; however, radiofrequency ablation is
   among the tested and proven treatments for varicose veins. With every
   case, there can be some unexpected or interesting scenarios which can
   pose both technical and surgical difficulties. The main objective of
   this paper is to introduce these scenarios which can occur despite
   following the standard protocol and methods both preoperatively and
   intraoperatively. In these scenarios, the surgeon quickly need to decide
   how to deal with the aberrations. Based on extensive literature and
   consensus of a team of three vascular surgeons, lists of interesting
   scenarios were prepared along with their definition. Any occurrences of
   such scenarios were noted in the operation theatre note. Here, we
   describe 39 (6.38\%) interesting cases among 611 cases of radiofrequency
   ablation that was performed in Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University
   Hospital, from January 2014 until December 2019. Despite following the
   proper protocol, we can face many unexpected challenges preoperatively,
   peroperatively, and postoperatively. From this article, we concluded
   that vigilance of all the factors and proper Doppler ultrasonography can
   help in identifying most of these scenarios and aid in making proper
   surgical planning.}},

Abstract = {{Background Erectile dysfunction is associated with old age, some
   morbidities and the use of certain medications. Objective To identify
   the treatments and drugs related to worsening sexual activity in
   patients with erectile dysfunction. Setting Patients diagnosed with
   erectile dysfunction during 2018. Methods This cross-sectional study of
   a population database identified all drug prescriptions of patients with
   erectile dysfunction during 2018. Main outcome measure The
   identification of other comorbidities and potentially inappropriate
   drugs that could worsen erectile dysfunction. Results A total of 2999
   patients with erectile dysfunction (mean age 59.6 +/- 12.1 years) were
   identified. A total of 88.2\% received pharmacological treatment for
   erectile dysfunction, mainly tadalafil (70.5\%). A total of 47.6\% of
   all patients received at least one medication associated with worsening
   erectile dysfunction, especially hydrochlorothiazide (17.0\%),
   metoprolol (7.9\%) and sertraline (6.7\%). Residing in Cali (OR 1.86;
   95\% CI 1.52-22.27) or Bucaramanga (OR 2.23; 95\% CI 1.39-33.58), having
   3 or more chronic comorbidities (OR 1.52; 95\% CI 1.04-2.24) and
   presenting psychiatric (OR 5.5; 95\% CI 3.70-8.17), cardiovascular (OR
   3.48; 95\% CI 2.79-4.33), genitourinary (OR 1.31; 95\% CI 1.05-1.64)
   pathologies or chronic kidney failure (OR 1.84; 95\% CI 1.18-2.21)
   elevated the probability of receiving these prescriptions. Conclusions
   The pharmacological treatment of erectile dysfunction was in accordance
   with the recommendations of clinical practice guidelines, but the high
   proportion of potentially inappropriate prescriptions makes it necessary
   to promote educational and pharmacovigilance strategies that improve the
   prescription habits of physicians involved in caring for this group of
   patients.}},

Title = {{The rs78378222 prevalence and the copy loss of the protective allele A
   in the tumor tissue of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are likely to be
   a crucial genetic factor for human diseases, including cancer.
   rs78378222 is rare SNP in 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of TP53 gene
   leading to disturbance of 3'-end mRNA processing. The frequency of
   rs78378222 varies in several studied populations. The meta-analysis of
   34 genome-wide association studies indicated that rs78378222 was
   significantly associated with an increased risk of cancer overall.
   Bioinformatic analysis indicates that somatic loss of the protective A
   allele of rs78378222 occurs in the tumor tissue of some malignant. The
   goal of the current study is to document the rs78378222 prevalence and
   evaluate the copy loss status of the protective allele A in the tumor
   tissue of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
   Methods: Total DNA was isolated from FFPE-samples and peripheral blood
   of patients with DLBCL and comparable in age and sex controls.
   rs78378222 genotyping was performed by the PCR-RFLP method using
   restriction endonuclease HindIII. Direct Sanger's sequencing was used to
   confirm the presence of C allele of the rs78378222. The search for TP53
   gene mutations was carried out by Sanger's direct sequencing method,
   according to the IARC protocol.
   Results: The result of genotyping of 136 DNA samples from DLBCL tumor
   tissue suggested that frequency of the rs78378222 was 11/136 (8.1\%).
   Rare allele C frequency was 11/272 (4.2\%). A total of 5/11 DLBCL
   rs78378222 heterozygous samples had the heterozygosity loss in the TP53
   gene. Only one of these cases was combined with TP53 gene mutations
   which have proven oncogenic potential-p. Arg196Gln, other four cases
   have not mutations in the coding regions of gene.
   Conclusions: At the stages of DLBCL initiation or progression a loss of
   the protective allele A of rs78378222 occurs. Further efforts are needed
   to study possible molecular mechanisms underlying somatic alterations in
   DLBCL in this region of the TP53 3'-UTR as well as functional studies to
   illustrate how the presents of rs78378222 may affect tumor progression
   of lymphoma.}},

Title = {{Engagement Enhancement Based on Human-in-the-Loop Optimization for
   Neural Rehabilitation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROROBOTICS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Enhancing patients' engagement is of great benefit for neural
   rehabilitation. However, physiological and neurological differences
   among individuals can cause divergent responses to the same task, and
   the responses can further change considerably during training; both of
   these factors make engagement enhancement a challenge. This challenge
   can be overcome by training task optimization based on subjects'
   responses. To this end, an engagement enhancement method based on
   human-in-the-loop optimization is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an
   interactive speed-tracking riding game is designed as the training task
   in which four reference speed curves (RSCs) are designed to construct
   the reference trajectory in each generation. Each RSC is modeled using a
   piecewise function, which is determined by the starting velocity,
   transient time, and end velocity. Based on the parameterized model, the
   difficulty of the training task, which is a key factor affecting the
   engagement, can be optimized. Then, the objective function is designed
   with consideration to the tracking accuracy and the surface
   electromyogram (sEMG)-based muscle activation, and the physical and
   physiological responses of the subjects can consequently be evaluated
   simultaneously. Moreover, a covariance matrix adaption evolution
   strategy, which is relatively tolerant of both measurement noises and
   human adaptation, is used to generate the optimal parameters of the RSCs
   periodically. By optimization of the RSCs persistently, the objective
   function can be maximized, and the subjects' engagement can be enhanced.
   Finally, the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by the
   validation and comparison experiments. The results show that both
   subjects' sEMG-based motor engagement and electroencephalography based
   neural engagement can be improved significantly and maintained at a high
   level.}},

Abstract = {{Dugesia japonica, belonging to Platyhelminthes, plays an important role
   in the animal evolution and is well known for its extraordinary
   regenerative ability. Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is
   an important cell signaling pathway that converts extracellular stimuli
   into a wide range of cellular responses. The MAP-extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase (MEK) is a main component of MAPK/ERK signaling,
   but there are few studies on mek gene in planarians. In this study, we
   observe the expression patterns of Djmek1 and Djmek2 in planarians, and
   find that both of the two genes are required for the planarian
   regeneration. At the same time, we also find that both Djmek1 and Djmek2
   are involved in the planarian regeneration by regulation of cell
   proliferation and apoptosis. Together, our findings show that the
   functions of the two genes are similar and complementary, and they play
   an important role in the regeneration of planarians. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The growth inhibitions of four commercially available isomerized hop
   products, in which dihydro iso-alpha-acids, tetrahydro iso-alpha-acids,
   and hexahydro iso-alpha-acids are derived from natural iso-alpha-acids,
   against brewing-related microorganisms were studied. The tests were
   carried out in three media: liquid (broth, pH 6-7), solid (agar, pH 6-7)
   and beer (pH 4.2). The results indicate that Staphylococcus aureus (S.
   aureus) ZJ007 (G(+)) was the most sensitive strain to any hop product at
   the lowest concentration of 0.1 g/L in liquid and 0.5 g/L in solid.
   However, in liquid media, hexahydro iso-alpha-acids showed significant
   antibacterial potency on E. coli DH5a and Lactococcus species AB133 at
   0.5 g/L (equating to 50 mg/L concentration). Interestingly, the growths
   of E. coli DH5 alpha (G(-)) and wild Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY101
   (wild yeast), respectively, in the solid media were inhibited by
   hexahydro and tetrahydro iso-alpha-acids (equating to 250-500 mg/L) and
   dihydro and iso-alpha-acids (750-1500 mg/L), and no effect on
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae (DM303). By the same means, the growths of
   Lactococcus species AB133 (possible hop resistant, G(+)) and Lactococcus
   lactis NZ9000 (hop-resistant G(+), tolerated to iso-alpha-acids) were
   inhibited by hexahydro > tetrahydro iso-alpha-acids (equating to 500
   mg/L) and not affected by dihydro and iso-alpha-acids. Overall, the
   hexahydro iso-alpha-acids are the most effective bacteriostat. The
   microscopy did not detect any strain in the inoculated and hopped beer
   (>= 50 mg/L or BU) precipitates after fermentation. The GC-MS analysis
   showed insignificant aroma difference compared to the control beer
   (DM303 yeast only). For the implications, four isomerized hop products
   are more soluble and offer higher concentration in any neutral medium
   (pH 6-7) than their undissociated forms (pH <= 4). In the milder pH
   range, their antibacterial behavior is hexahydro > dihydro > tetrahydro
   similar to iso-alpha-acids.}},

Abstract = {{Sorafenib resistance has become the main obstacle in the effective
   treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.
   Activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) is a newly identified
   mechanism that contributes to desensitized sorafenib. Cytochrome P450
   1A2 (CYP1A2) functions as a tumor suppressor in HCC and its expression
   is negatively associated with NF-kappa B in the liver. This study aimed
   to study whether CYP1A2 could overcome sorafenib resistance. To
   investigate whether CYP1A2 and NF-kappa B p65 played roles in sorafenib
   desensitization, we established sorafenib-resistant (SR) HCC cells. SR
   cells decreased the expression of CYP1A2 along with the upregulation of
   NF-kappa B p65. CYP1A2 overexpression attenuated SR cell proliferation,
   increased sorafenib sensitivity, and inhibited the NF-kappa B pathway,
   whereas CYP1A2 silence showed opposite effects. Sorafenib, in
   combination with omeprazole, a CYP1A2 inducer, significantly hindered
   the growth and invasion of SR cells in vitro as well as decreased the
   tumor growth in vivo. The combination treatment markedly increased
   CYP1A2 expression and inhibited the sorafenib-induced NF-kappa B
   signaling. In addition, the overexpression of NF-kappa B p65 stimulated
   the SR cell growth and desensitized sorafenib in SR cells, where CYP1A2
   overexpression reversed the phenomenon. Lastly, the majority of HCC
   tissue samples displayed decreased CYP1A2 but increased NF-kappa B p65
   protein expression. Collectively, CYP1A2 can sensitize SR cells to
   sorafenib via inhibiting NF-kappa B p65 axis. Omeprazole in combination
   with sorafenib exerts a synergistic effect in alleviating acquired
   sorafenib resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of
   long-term organic materials incorporation on the soil aggregate and
   density-based fractions, and associated soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)
   conversion in the rice fields. Materials and methods A long-term located
   experiment was conducted to study the effects of continuous application
   of organic materials (milk vetch, rice straw, and poultry manure) on the
   distribution characteristics of soil aggregate and density-based
   fraction, as well as its organic C and N, in rice fields. The soil
   aggregate was classified using the wet-sieving method. Light fraction
   (LF) and heavy fraction (HF) were classified according to density
   fractionation. Aggregate organic C (AC) and total N (AN), LF organic C
   (LFC) and N (LFN), and HF organic C and N concentrations were measured
   by using the Elementar Vario ISOTOPE elemental analyzer. Results and
   discussion Application of organic materials increased the aggregate mass
   proportion of 2-0.25 mm (by 4.9-12.6\%) and 0.25-0.053 mm (by
   27.5-40.7\%) fraction and its AC and AN concentration. The soil
   aggregate particulate organic C and total N were greatly improved with
   organic materials application. Furthermore, organic material had more
   obvious effect on the soil C and N in the LF than HF, which improved the
   LF particulate mass proportions by 75.1-177.0\%, LFC by 51.7-68.4\%, and
   LFN by 14.2-111.2\%, respectively. Poultry manure had the greatest
   effect on increasing the AC, LFC, AN, and LFN, followed by milk vetch
   and rice straw. Conclusions Milk vetch, rice straw, and poultry manure
   could effectively increase the soil intermediate aggregate and LF
   proportion, and stimulate the stabilization and fixation of C and N in
   rice fields. It is an effective agricultural practice by applying
   organic material to improve soil fertility and sustaining high crop
   productivity. The increases of intermediate aggregate and associated C
   and N may be the main factor for soil C and N sequestration under
   continual application of organic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Background Plant papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) are a large
   class of proteolytic enzymes and play important roles in root nodule
   symbiosis (RNS), while the whole-genome studies of PLCP family genes in
   legume are quite limited, and the roles of Glycine max PLCPs (GmPLCPs)
   in nodulation, nodule development and senescence are not fully
   understood. Results In the present study, we identified 97 GmPLCPs and
   performed a genome-wide survey to explore the expansion of soybean PLCP
   family genes and their relationships to RNS. Nineteen paralogous pairs
   of genomic segments, consisting of 77 GmPLCPs, formed by whole-genome
   duplication (WGD) events were identified, showing a high degree of
   complexity in duplication. Phylogenetic analysis among different species
   showed that the lineage differentiation of GmPLCPs occurred after family
   expansion, and large tandem repeat segment were specifically in soybean.
   The expression patterns of GmPLCPs in symbiosis-related tissues and
   nodules identified RNS-related GmPLCPs and provided insights into their
   putative symbiotic functions in soybean. The symbiotic function analyses
   showed that a RNS-related GmPLCP gene (Glyma.04G190700) really
   participate in nodulation and nodule development. Conclusions Our
   findings improved our understanding of the functional diversity of
   legume PLCP family genes, and provided insights into the putative roles
   of the legume PLCPs in nodulation, nodule development and senescence.}},

Abstract = {{Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the frequently occurred
   malignancies in the world. To date, several onco-microRNAs (miRNAs or
   miRs), including miR-96, have been identified in the pathogenesis of
   CRC. In the present study, we aimed to corroborate the oncogenic effect
   of miR-96 on CRC and to identify the specific mechanisms related to AMPK
   alpha 2/FTO/m6A/MYC. Methods RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were
   performed to examine the expression pattern of miR-96, AMPK alpha 2, FTO
   and MYC in the clinical CRC tissues and cells. The relationship between
   miR-96 and AMPK alpha 2 was then predicted using in silico analysis and
   identified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Gain- or loss-of-function
   approaches were manipulated to evaluate the modulatory effects of
   miR-96, AMPK alpha 2, FTO and MYC on cell growth, cycle progression and
   apoptosis. The mechanism of FTO-mediated m6A modification of MYC was
   analyzed via Me-RIP and PAR-CLIP analysis. The mediatory effects of
   miR-96 antagomir on cancerogenesis were validated in vivo. Results
   miR-96, FTO and MYC were upregulated, while AMPK alpha 2 was
   downregulated in CRC tissues and cells. miR-96 could down-regulate AMPK
   alpha 2, which led to increased expression of FTO and subsequent
   upregulated expression of MYC via blocking its m6A modification. This
   mechanism was involved in the pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic roles
   of miR-96 in CRC cells. Besides, down-regulation of miR-96 exerted
   inhibitory effect on tumor growth in vivo. Conclusions Taken together,
   miR-96 antagomir could potentially retard the cancerogenesis in CRC via
   AMPK alpha 2-dependent inhibition of FTO and blocking FTO-mediated m6A
   modification of MYC, highlighting novel mechanisms associated with
   colorectal cancerogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{The local atomic structure, local chemistry, and stoichiometry of grain
   boundaries control in part the strength and fracture toughness of
   silicon carbide components. The predictions of the structure and
   properties of these grain boundaries are generally limited to their
   ground-state configurations. We investigated the tensile strength
   behavior of metastable grain boundaries in silicon carbide using
   high-throughput atomistic simulations combined with machine learning
   techniques. We analyzed and compared the Sigma 5 < 100 >\{120\} and
   Sigma 9 < 110 >\{122\} tilt grain boundary metastable configurations to
   identify structural and chemical attributes that dominate their tensile
   strength. We characterized these metastable grain boundaries using a set
   of microscopic descriptors representing the local grain boundary atomic
   structure and the local grain boundary stoichiometry and chemical-bound
   types. We used a boosted regression tree surrogate model for the
   successful prediction of metastable grain boundary strength as a
   function of these descriptors. Our results show that the tensile
   strength of generic (i.e., any random grain boundary from the entire
   grain boundary population), metastable grain boundaries is primarily
   dominated by the grain boundary excess free volume, closely followed by
   the type of structure composing the boundary and the amount of C-C
   bonds. The 5\% strongest metastable grain boundaries have particular
   characteristics with a low amount of free volume and the highest density
   of C-C bonds. Our results reveal that the 5\% strongest and weakest
   metastable grain boundaries are most sensitive to the local
   stoichiometry, regardless of the local atomic structure composing the
   grain boundary as compared to any other generic metastable grain
   boundaries. We show that the strongest and weakest metastable grain
   boundary configurations can be identified as specific regions in a
   low-dimensional-representation space of their microscopic descriptors.
   Taken together, these findings showcase the effectiveness and validity
   of using a low-dimensional representation of the grain boundary
   structure and machine-learned surrogate models to rapidly assess
   metastable grain boundary strength without the need to perform actual
   tensile simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear vortex-induced vibration of a rectangular section with an
   aspect ratio B/D = 6 is investigated in this study, aiming at
   explanation of the phenomenon of double lock-in ranges. First, numerical
   results by two-dimensional CFD simulation are compared with experimental
   results; then flow field characteristics, aerodynamic loadings and
   structural motion properties are presented and discussed; finally, an
   energy-trapping-based model for motion stability is brought forward,
   based on which the observed aeroelastic phenomena are discussed. The
   present study shows the motion-induced lock-in range is able to be
   explained qualitatively with the proposed principle describing the
   free-oscillation stability. Within the motion-induced lock-in range, the
   1-DOF system can experience two motion components. The dominance of the
   free vibration fueled by feedback lift can dwarf or even eliminate the
   vortex-shedding-induced motion. Further, it is demonstrated that the
   phase angle between the lift and motion velocity, instead of the load
   amplitude, dominates the motion stability.}},

Journal = {{FASEB JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{Chronic vascular inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of
   atherosclerosis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as
   essential inflammation regulators. We identify a novel lncRNA termed
   lncRNA-MAP3K4 that is enriched in the vessel wall and regulates vascular
   inflammation. In the aortic intima, lncRNA-MAP3K4 expression was reduced
   by 50\% during the progression of atherosclerosis (chronic inflammation)
   and 70\% during endotoxemia (acute inflammation). lncRNA-MAP3K4
   knockdown reduced the expression of key inflammatory factors (eg,
   ICAM-1, E-selectin, MCP-1) in endothelial cells or vascular smooth
   muscle cells and decreased monocytes adhesion to endothelium, as well as
   reducing TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, COX2 expression in macrophages.
   Mechanistically, lncRNA-MAP3K4 regulates inflammation through the p38
   MAPK signaling pathway. lncRNA-MAP3K4 shares a bidirectional promoter
   with MAP3K4, an upstream regulator of the MAPK signaling pathway, and
   regulates its transcription in cis. lncRNA-MAP3K4 and MAP3K4 show
   coordinated expression in response to inflammation in vivo and in vitro.
   Similar to lncRNA-MAP3K4, MAP3K4 knockdown reduced the expression of
   inflammatory factors in several different vascular cells. Furthermore,
   lncRNA-MAP3K4 and MAP3K4 knockdown showed cooperativity in reducing
   inflammation in endothelial cells. Collectively, these findings unveil
   the role of a novel lncRNA in vascular inflammation by cis-regulating
   MAP3K4 via a p38 MAPK pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Raspberry ketone (RK) supplements provided together with sugar and yeast
   hydrolysate accelerate sexual maturation and increase mating success of
   Queensland fruit fly ('Qfly') males. However, the mechanisms underlying
   this enhanced mating ability are currently unknown. Volatiles are an
   important element of Qfly sexual calling and courtship and so changes in
   volatiles quantity or quality may be involved, and the present study
   investigated this possibility. Flies were fed a diet of sugar only (S)
   or yeast hydrolysate mixed with sugar (YH + S) (1:3) that contained 0\%
   RK (control) and 5\% RK (treated) for 2 days after emergence. Volatile
   compounds were extracted from rectal glands when flies were 6, 8, 10,
   20, and 30 days old. Males fed on RK exhibited a significant increase in
   total volatile production in rectal glands compared to RK-unfed males
   (control). Males fed on RK with YH + S produced significantly higher
   amount of volatiles than males fed on RK with sugar only. Males fed on
   YH + S diet produced more volatiles in the presence of RK compared to
   males fed on YH + S diet only. Two compounds, N-(3-methylbutyl)acetamide
   and N-(3-methylbutyl)propanamide were dominant in endogenously produced
   rectal gland volatiles comprising ca. more than 90\% of the total amount
   in both RK-fed and control males. Considering exogenous and endogenous
   compounds together, unaltered RK was dominant along with these two
   endogenous compounds in RK-fed males in rectal gland until 30 days of
   age in both diet groups.}},

Abstract = {{We aimed to assess the feasibility of machine learning (ML) algorithm
   design to predict proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) by
   ophthalmologists without coding experience using automated ML (AutoML).
   The study was a retrospective cohort study of 506 eyes who underwent
   pars plana vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) by a
   single surgeon at a tertiary-care hospital between 2012 and 2019. Two
   ophthalmologists without coding experience used an interactive
   application in MATLAB to build and evaluate ML algorithms for the
   prediction of postoperative PVR using clinical data from the electronic
   health records. The clinical features associated with postoperative PVR
   were determined by univariate feature selection. The area under the
   curve (AUC) for predicting postoperative PVR was better for models that
   included pre-existing PVR as an input. The quadratic support vector
   machine (SVM) model built using all selected clinical features had an
   AUC of 0.90, a sensitivity of 63.0\%, and a specificity of 97.8\%. An
   optimized Naive Bayes algorithm that did not include pre-existing PVR as
   an input feature had an AUC of 0.81, a sensitivity of 54.3\%, and a
   specificity of 92.4\%. In conclusion, the development of ML models for
   the prediction of PVR by ophthalmologists without coding experience is
   feasible. Input from a data scientist might still be needed to tackle
   class imbalance-a common challenge in ML classification using real-world
   clinical data.}},
